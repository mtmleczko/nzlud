PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Melbourne, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 Code, as supplemented through March 27, 2012, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to Cathleen A. Wysor, City Clerk, and Paul Gougelman, former City Attorney, Alison Dawley, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The Charter of the City of Melbourne was enacted as Chapter 69-879, Laws of Florida, Special Acts 1969; was adopted at a referendum held on July 15, 1969; and is included herein for the convenience of the users of this Code. The chapter title and the description of the city boundaries have been omitted from this printing. The original arrangement and numbering system have been maintained, but a uniform system of capitalization and indention, like that used in the Code portion of this volume, has been employed. Amendments to the original enactment have been worked into their proper places, and history notes indicating the origin of the amendatory section and the date of the referendum, where applicable, have been added. The absence of such a history note indicates that the section was derived unamended from the original enactment. Corrections and explanatory words are indicated by brackets [ ]. The original Charter, Laws of Florida, ch. 69-879, was in existence in that form on July 1, 1973. At that time cities were granted home rule powers by the Florida Constitution in article VIII, § 2(b), as implemented by F.S. ch. 166, the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act. F.S. § 166.021(4) states that municipalities may exercise all powers for municipal governmental, corporate or proprietary purposes not expressly prohibited by the constitution, general or special law, and repealed all limitations on the exercise of that power in any Charter or special act in existence on July 1, 1973, except for those provisions which may only be amended by referendum or special act as indicated regarding the following areas: 
(1) Creation or existence of the municipality; 
(2) Establishment of the form of government; 
(3) Grants of extraterritorial power or power affecting areas which include lands outside the municipality which must be by general law or special act; 
(4) Establishment of terms of elected officials and the manner of their election; 
(5) Distribution of power among elected officials; 
(6) Matters relating to appointive boards; 
(7) Any rights of municipal employees. 
Therefore, those sections of the Charter not one of the areas listed, by operation of F.S. § 166.021, were converted to ordinances and any limitations on the exercise of the home rule powers in said Charter were repealed on the effective date of the Act, October 1, 1973. However, if any section of a Charter was amended by referendum after October 1, 1973, then it must be subsequently amended by referendum as stated in Attorney General Opinion 75-223. Therefore, the provisions of the Charter were either converted to an ordinance, repealed as a limitation on the exercise of home rule powers or is one of the categories which may only be amended by referendum.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 1.01. - Creation of government. 
    There is hereby created a municipal corporation under the name of the City of Melbourne, in the County of Brevard, State of Florida, which city shall have all powers possible for a city to have under the Constitution and laws of the State of Florida as fully and completely as if specifically enumerated in this Charter, in addition to any powers specifically so enumerated. 
Sec. 1.02. - Construction of powers; retention of former powers. 
    The powers of the city shall be construed liberally in favor of the city, and the specification of particular powers shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers possessed by the city. The city shall have implied and incidental powers to exercise those powers enumerated herein or granted by general law. 
    The City of Melbourne shall have and may exercise all the powers heretofore possessed by the several municipalities abolished pursuant to this Charter, and by any commission, agency or board exercising any governmental function or powers within such municipalities, to the extent not inconsistent with this Charter, as such powers existed on the date this Charter takes effect. This section shall control whether any such powers were created, granted, or possessed pursuant to special act, municipal charter, or otherwise. 
Editor's note- The editor has deleted the last sentence of § 1.02, concerning urban renewal powers, as posing a limitation repealed pursuant to F.S. § 166.021. 
Sec. 1.03. - Abolition of existing governmental agencies. 
    Subject to the referendum provisions of section 8.09(2) herein [section 8.09 has been repealed], which determine the conditions under which this Charter becomes valid, and determine which municipalities are included therein, and upon the effective date of this Charter, and as provided therein, the existing municipal govt.'s [governments] of any of the following named municipalities which are included in the validated Charter: Existing municipal government of Eau Gallie in Brevard County, Florida, is hereby abolished. Every commission, agency or board exercising any governmental function or powers within such municipality is similarly abolished. 
    The City of Melbourne shall succeed to own and possess all property, property rights, interest, uncollected taxes, dues, claims, judgments, and choses in action held or owned by such municipality, commissions, agencies, or boards. The city shall have, exercise and enjoy all the rights, immunities, powers, benefits, privileges and franchises now or formerly possessed or held by said abolished municipality, commissions, agencies or boards, either individually or collectively. 
Editor's note- This section was editorially corrected to delete Indialantic, Melbourne, Melbourne Beach, Palm Bay, Palm Shores, West Melbourne, and Melbourne Village as only Melbourne and Eau Gallie merged and became the City of Melbourne. 
Sec. 1.04. - Former obligations. 
    No obligation or contract of the governmental agencies, which term includes municipalities, abolished pursuant to this Act, or any of them, including bonds heretofore issued, shall be impaired or avoided by this Charter, but all debts, obligations and contracts of the abolished governmental agencies shall pass to and be binding upon the City of Melbourne as hereinafter provided; and all debts, obligations and contracts heretofore legally and validly incurred or let by said governmental agencies are hereby ratified, validated and confirmed as binding obligations of the City of Melbourne. 
Sec. 1.05. - Boundaries. 
Editor's note- The description of the city boundaries has been omitted from this publication by the editor since it is subject to change. Section 2 of Chapter 70-807, Laws of Florida, amended the original boundaries. Documents setting forth a description of the city boundaries are on file in the office of the city clerk. 
State Law reference- Municipal annexation or contraction, F.S. ch. 171. 
Sec. 1.06. - Intergovernmental relations. 
    The city may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or in cooperation, by contract or otherwise, with any one or more states or agencies thereof, other counties or municipalities, or the United States or agencies thereof, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

    A proposed ordinance may be amended at either meeting. However, no ordinance shall be amended at the second or later reading so as to change its intent without a further reading at least one week later. The council may provide for public hearings or for the publication of notice concerning the subject matter of any proposed ordinance or amendment.

An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate of stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.

(b)  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such board is required to pass under such ordinance. 
(c)  To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so justice [will be] done. 
(13)  Decision of board. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, such board may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter [article], reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of five (5) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance, or to effect any variation in such ordinance.

Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the governing body of the municipality, may present to a circuit court a petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality in the manner and within the time provided by the Florida appellate rules. 
(15)  Enforcement of ordinance or regulation under this chapter [article]; penalties for violation. The city council of said municipality shall provide by ordinance for the enforcement of this section and of any ordinance or regulation made thereunder.

(17)  Powers granted in this chapter [article] supplemental and cumulative. This section shall not be construed to have the effect of repealing, impairing, or modifying any general or special law granted any like or similar powers to municipalities, but the powers herein granted shall be supplemental and cumulative.

(1)  The notice of appeal shall be filed with the city clerk with a copy to the planning and zoning board secretary within 30 days of the rendition of the planning and zoning board's decision. The city clerk shall stamp the date of filing on the notice of appeal so that compliance with the 30-day filing requirement can be quickly and easily ascertained. 
(2)  If the date of rendition of the planning and zoning board's decision and the date of appeal are within 30 days of each other, a determination shall be made that the appeal has been timely filed.

(2)  Variances. Unless prohibited by Code, to authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of appendices A, B, and D, excepting chapter 13 of appendix D, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this division could result in unnecessary hardship. 
(Code 1984, § 2-173.1; Ord. No. 2008-10, § 1, 3-25-2008) 
Sec. 2-420. - Duties of administrative official, board of adjustment, city council on matters of appeal. 
(a)  It is the intent of this Code that matters relating to code enforcement shall be presented to the building official. 
(b)  All questions of interpretation of appendices A, B, and D of the land development code (excepting chapter 10 relating to impact fees and chapter 13 relating to buildings and building regulations) shall be first presented to the community development director. In interpreting appendices A, B, or D of the land development code (excepting chapter 10 relating to impact fees and chapter 13 relating to buildings and building regulations), the community development director shall be guided first by the plain meaning of the words and terms in the Code and second by the intent expressed therein. The community development director shall make interpretations by interpreting the Code as a whole and not by taking specific words or clauses in isolation. In interpreting whether a particular use is allowed either as a principal, conditional or accessory use, the community development director shall be guided first by the specific uses delineated in particular zoning districts, and if the specific use sought is not delineated, the community development director shall be guided by the delineated uses to determine whether uses similar thereto are permitted and by examination of the intent of the zoning district. The letter of final determination must include in it instructions to the addressee with regard to how and when the addressee or other substantially affected party may appeal the determination. Thereafter, the board of adjustment shall have the authority to hear and decide appeals from the decision of the community development director where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the community development director in interpreting appendices A, B, or D (excluding chapter 10 relating to impact fees and chapter 13 relating to buildings and building regulations). 
(1)  Hearings; appeals; notice. An appeal of any decision of the community development director in the interpretation of any portion of appendices A, B, or D of the land development code may be initiated by any person aggrieved and substantially affected greater in degree or differently than the community at large, or by the city manager. Such appeal shall be filed no later than 30 days following the date of rendition of the interpretation by the community development director. The term "rendition" shall be defined as the issuance of a written determination of interpretation by the community development director effective upon the date that a signed original is filed in the records of the secretary/clerk to the community development director. A copy of said letter of determination must be hand delivered or mailed, postage prepaid by U.S. certified mail, to the person requesting the determination. The letter must be mailed or hand delivered on the date of filing in the record of the secretary/clerk to the community development director. An appeal is initiated by filing with the community development director and with the secretary to the board of adjustment, a notice of appeal specifying the interpretation appealed from and a description of the reasons why the interpretation is in error. The secretary to the board of adjustment shall, within 15 days thereafter, transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. A fee may be charged for said appeal, said fee being an amount fixed from time to time by resolution of the city council. The secretary of the board after receipt of the record shall fix a time for hearing of the appeal and give public notice thereof at least 15 days in advance of the public hearing as well as notice to the parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. 
(2)  Stay of proceeding. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the community development director certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the community development director's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application. 
(c)  It is further the intent of this section that the duties of the city council in connection with this Code shall not include hearing and deciding questions of interpretation or enforcement that may arise. The procedure for deciding questions shall be as stated in this section and this Code. Under this Code, the city council shall have only the duties: 
(1)  Of considering and adopting or rejecting proposed amendments or the repeal of this code, as provided by law; 
(2)  Of establishing a schedule of fees and charges; and 
(3)  To hear and decide applications for conditional uses as provided for in herein.

The city shall give award preference to a local business in the purchase of commodities, personal property, general services, professional services, and the purchase of or contract for construction or renovation of public works or other public improvements by means of formal quote or competitive bid in the following manner:

a.  Under a competitive quote/bid solicitation, when a qualified responsive, responsible non-local business submits the lowest price quote/bid, and a quote/bid submitted by one or more responsive, responsible local-city businesses is within five percent of the price submitted by the non-local business, then each of the responsive, responsible local businesses within five percent shall have the opportunity to submit an offer to match the price submitted by the non-local bidder. A price match document must be received within five business days after issuance. 
b.  If the initial lowest local-city business submits an offer that matches the lowest non-local quote/bid, and the two vendors are similarly qualified and responsive bidders, then the award shall be made to the local-city business. 
c.  If the initial lowest local-city business declines or is unable to match the lowest non-local quote/bid, then the option to do so moves to the next initial lowest local-city business, and so on, that is a similarly qualified and responsive bidder. 
(4)  Local-county preference. 
a.  At such time that there is no local-city business within five percent of the lowest bid, or all eligible local-city bidders decline the option to match the lowest quote/bid, then the offer to match the lowest non-local bid shall go to each of the similarly qualified and responsive local-county businesses whose submitted bid is within two percent of the lowest bid.

(7)  Tie quotes/bids. In the event of a tie between the initial quote/bid of two or more local businesses, the local business with the greatest number of full-time employees working in the city or county, respectively, shall be awarded the purchase or contract. 
(d)  Exception to local vendor preference policy. The local preference policy set forth herein shall not apply to any of the following purchases or contracts: 
(1)  Goods or services provided under a cooperative purchasing agreement or piggyback agreement; 
(2)  Purchases or contracts which are funded, in whole or part, by a governmental entity and the laws, regulations, or policies governing such funding prohibit application of that preference;

(6)  Where all quotes/bids are rejected. 
(e)  Waiver of the application for local vendor preference policy. Any request for the waiver of local preference to any particular purchase or contract must be approved by either the city manager or the city council, depending upon approval threshold, prior to advertising the quote/bid. The city manager or city council, as the respective awarding authority, may approve the waiver of local preference upon review and at their discretion. 
(f)  Comparison and review of qualifications. The preferences established herein in no way prohibit the right of the city to compare and review the quality of materials proposed for purchase, and to compare and review the qualifications, character, responsibility, and fitness of all persons, firms or corporations submitting quotes/bids. Furthermore, the local preference established herein shall not prohibit the city from giving any other preference permitted by law in addition to the local preference contained herein.

Village of Somerset, 316 F.3d 702 (7th Cir. 2003), on materials made of record relating to the St. Johns County Public Nudity Ordinance, and on the substance of and findings made or incorporated in studies accomplished in other communities and ordinances enacted in other communities, including, but not limited to, New York, New York; City of Houston Ordinance Number 97-75; Senate Bill Number 232, as passed by the Kansas State Legislature; Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Macon-Bibb County, Georgia; Palm Beach County, Florida; Manatee County, Florida; the findings of the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota; the report of United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986); Jacksonville, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning, Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984; the publication entitled "Protecting Communities From Sexually Oriented Businesses" (Southwest Legal Press, Inc.); the publication entitled "Local Regulation of Adult Businesses" (Clark, Boardman and Callaghan); publications prepared by the Florida Family Association, Inc. (Tampa, Florida) relating to the regulation of sexually oriented businesses and adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses; the "Report to: The American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses," Peter R. Hecht, Ph.D. (1996); and the findings of fact relating to the Adult Entertainment Code of Orange County, Florida, and the findings of fact relating to the Sexually Oriented Business and Adult Entertainment Establishment Ordinance of Seminole County, Florida, matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to this chapter and other matters and documents relating to all of the above; the city council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this chapter engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers. 
(4)  Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments. 
(6)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States (600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31, 1992, and the number of people in the United States living with an AIDS diagnosis as of February, 2012 is 479,161). 
(8)  As of December 31, 1995, there have been 51,838 reported cases of AIDS in the state. 
(9)  From 1981 to June 1996, the number of living persons testing positive for the HIV antibody with AIDS symptoms has risen to 73,217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements. 
(10)  The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990. 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported in 2011 was 321,849. 
(12)  The surgeon general of the United States, in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult oriented films. 
(16)  The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (15) of this section and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(17)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(19)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(20)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments. 
(21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business and adult entertainment establishments, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(23)  The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter. 
(24)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central Florida where adult entertainment material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold for commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas. 
(25)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in the state where adult entertainment and sexually oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude, or topless dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas, or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(26)  Commercial sexually oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in the state where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact, escort services and other services providing sexual encounters. The workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in the state engage in physical contact or touching with customers, including, but not limited to, acts of prostitution, or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness. 
(27)  The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order, health, safety, economy, property values, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit the city who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes. 
(28)  When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(29)  When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(30)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(31)  The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment. 
(32)  Physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(33)  In order to preserve and safeguard the good order, health, morals, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. 
(34)  The potential dangers to the good order, morals, health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(35)  Requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments. 
(36)  Prohibiting sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses. 
(37)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. 
(38)  Workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses, including, but not limited to, a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of F.S. ch. 796, operation without business tax receipts and illegal and unlicensed massage. 
(39)  Physical contact or touching between workers of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmissible diseases. 
(40)  The practice of not paying or underpaying workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers. 
(41)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and, therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community. 
(42)  Requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist in facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur. 
(43)  The general welfare, health, good order, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter. 
(c)  Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to protect and preserve the good order, health, peace, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. This chapter regulates conduct and is not an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by F.S. § 166.041. 
(d)  Authority. This chapter is enacted under the constitutionally derived home rule power of the city in the interest of the good order, health, morals, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city. 
(e)  Recitals. It is the city council's further intention to accomplish those intents and purposes expressed by the city council in the recitals of the ordinance from which this section derives, each of which are incorporated by reference into this section. 
(f)  Speech protection. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit constitutionally protected expression or speech. This chapter is intended to reasonably regulate the adult entertainment industry and sexually oriented businesses which engage in commercial activities involving acts or services of a sexually explicit nature or which involve acts or services involving matters which are sexual in nature. 
(Code 1984, § 2.6-1; Ord. No. 2004-101, § 2, 1-11-2005; Ord. No. 2013-50, § 2(2.6-1), 8-27-2013) 
Sec. 4-2. - Construction. 
(a)  This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose of reasonably regulating sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments in order to reduce or eliminate adverse secondary effects of such businesses and establishments.

This chapter shall not be construed to authorize any illegal act under federal law, state law or city ordinance. This chapter is intended to reasonably regulate such matters in order to reduce or eliminate the adverse secondary effects of commercial establishments and businesses. The regulation of alcoholic beverage establishments is also addressed in the Code and other provisions of law. 
(b)  Unless otherwise indicated, all provisions of this chapter shall apply equally to all persons, regardless of sex. Masculine pronouns, such as "he," "his," and "him," as employed in this chapter, shall also be construed to apply to feminine pronouns and neutral pronouns, unless the context suggests otherwise.

(Code 1984, § 2.6-2; Ord. No. 2004-101, § 2, 1-11-2005) 
Sec. 4-3. - Obscenity/indecent exposure unlawful. 
    As a matter of state and federal law, obscenity is unlawful in the city. Likewise, state law prohibits indecent exposure. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow or permit the possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials; to authorize the exposing of persons under 18 years of age to motion pictures, exhibitions, shows, representations and presentations of specified sexual activities or persons displaying or exhibiting specified anatomical areas; or the indecent exposure of a person as prohibited by state law.

The suspension or revocation shall be abated in the event that a licensee files a timely challenge to the suspension or revocation in accordance with the procedures of this chapter or upon an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. A suspension or revocation already in effect, but not previously challenged in a suspension or revocation hearing, may be challenged in the same manner but is not abated during the proceedings. 
(b)  Hearing on suspension or revocation. When a licensee files a written response and notice of intent to challenge a pending or existing suspension or revocation then a public hearing to determine if the pending suspension or revocation will become effective and final shall be held by a hearing officer appointed by the city council.

(1)  Appointment, term and compensation of hearing officer. 
a.  Three hearing officers shall be appointed by the city council, and they shall be attorneys duly licensed to practice law in the state, who have practiced in the state for at least five years. 
b.  Hearing officers shall not be considered to be city employees, although they may receive compensation for their services and also may be reimbursed for such travel, mileage and per diem expenses as may be authorized. 
c.  Because only attorneys may hold the position of hearing officer, the city council shall not be required to retain an attorney to represent the hearing officer. 
d.  It shall be unlawful for a hearing officer to act as an agent or an attorney for a party involved in a determination under the provisions of this section or to be otherwise involved with any matter arising under this section which will come before the city during the term of the hearing officer's appointment. Further, a hearing officer shall not initiate or consider ex parte communications or other communications with any party of interest to a hearing officer concerning the substance of any proceeding to be heard by a hearing officer. However, the foregoing does not prohibit discussions between the hearing officer and city staff that pertain solely to scheduling and other administrative matters unrelated to the merits of the application. If a person engages in an ex parte communication with the hearing officer, the hearing officer shall place on the record of the pending case all ex parte written communications received, all written responses to such communications, a memorandum stating the substance of all oral communications received, and all oral responses made, and shall advise all parties that such matters have been placed on the record. Any party desiring to rebut the ex parte communication shall be entitled to do so but only if such party requests the opportunity for rebuttal within ten days after notice of such communication. If he deems it necessary due to the effect of an ex parte communication received by him, the hearing officer may withdraw from the case and the city council shall appoint another hearing officer to handle the case. 
e.  Selection of hearing officer. The city manager and the licensee shall each have the right to eliminate one of the three hearing officers selected by the city council. The one hearing officer not eliminated by either party shall act as the hearing officer for the license revocation hearing.

d.  Administer oaths and take testimony under oath; and 
e.  Issue an order having the force of law suspending or revoking the license.

(4)  The participants before the hearing officer shall be the licensee, any witnesses of the licensee, the city manager or his designee, and any witnesses of the city manager or his designee. All witnesses shall provide their legal name, mailing addresses and telephone number. 
(5)  The procedures used shall be those typically used in a civil case with the city manager or his designee having the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence. 
(6)  Testimony and evidence may be submitted by any witness but shall be limited to matters directly relating to the grounds for suspension or revocation. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious testimony or evidence shall be excluded. The Florida Rules of Evidence shall govern evidentiary issues at the hearing, and the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure shall govern procedural issues at the hearing. 
(7)  All testimony shall be under oath. The hearing officer shall decide all questions of procedure and standing. All hearings shall be open to the public. Minutes shall be kept at all hearings. Unless otherwise mutually agreed to between the licensee and the city manager or his designee, the order of presentation of testimony and evidence shall be as follows: 
a.  The city manager or his designee makes an opening statement.

(8)  The hearing officer may also call and question witnesses or request additional evidence as the hearing officer deems necessary and appropriate. 
(9)  The city shall provide a hearing room and clerical staff as may be reasonably required by the hearing officer to conduct hearings and perform his duties. 
(10)  Each party to the hearing shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross examine opposing witnesses, impeach witnesses and rebut evidence. 
(11)  The licensee has the right, at his own expense, to be represented by an attorney at any hearing. 
(12)  All testimony before the hearing officer shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The licensee or the city may cause a verbatim record of the proceedings to be made at the cost of whichever party made the request. The parties may agree to equally divide or otherwise divide the cost of the court reporter. 
(13)  If the hearing officer comes to believe that any facts, claims, or allegations necessitate additional review or response by either the licensee or the city manager or either of their respective designees, then the hearing officer may order the hearing continued until an announced date certain, not to exceed 30 days from the date of continuance. 
(14)  Hearing officers may allow the parties to submit written proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law following the hearing and shall advise the parties of the timetable for so doing, if allowed. 
(15)  Within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue an order setting forth findings of fact, based on evidence of record, and issue conclusions of law regarding whether the suspension or revocation will become or remain effective, and shall render relief in the order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted in this section. 
(c)  Filing of decision. The original of the written decision of the hearing officer shall be filed with the city clerk and copies shall be delivered or mailed to the licensee, the city manager or his designee and the city police department. 
(d)  Judicial review. Any person who participated in a suspension or revocation hearing before the hearing officer and who is aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may immediately challenge the decision in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the rules of procedure of that court. The record of the hearing shall consist of the complete record of the proceedings before the hearing officer. The hearing officer's decision shall be promptly reviewed by the court. 
(e)  Requirement of exhaustion procedures. Judicial review of a suspension or revocation, or related hearing or appeal proceedings, shall be available only after the administrative procedures and remedies set forth in this section have been exhausted. 
(f)  Notice of final suspension or revocation. If no response or request for a suspension or revocation hearing is filed within 15 days of the notice of a pending suspension or revocation, or if the licensee who requested the hearing does not appear at the suspension or revocation hearing after notice, or if the hearing officer decides after a hearing that a pending suspension or revocation will become final, then the city manager or his designee shall issue to the licensee notice of final suspension or revocation of the adult entertainment license and mail or arrange delivery of the notice to the licensee's record address. 
(g)  Effective date of suspension or revocation. The suspension or revocation of a license shall take effect the day after delivery of a notice of final suspension or revocation to the licensee in person, by posting on the licensed establishment, or by mail to the licensee's record address, or on the date the licensee surrenders the license, whichever happens first. The licensee shall immediately return and surrender a revoked license to the city manager or his designee or surrender the revoked license, upon demand, to a member of the police department.

Receipts may be produced either by cash registers which automatically record duplicate receipts or by some other method approved in advance by the city. All money received from sales shall be deposited in a separate bank account used only by that particular charity for bingo funds within 24 hours of when such money was received from a patron. No credit or extended payment terms shall be extended to any patron at any time. All expenditures related to any bingo game, instant bingo, or the charity's operation of bingo games, including, but not limited to, bingo prizes, rent, utilities, and all other costs of operation, shall be paid by pre-printed consecutively numbered checks written on the bingo bank account of the charity.

Two designated members of the charity must sign off before close of business that day as to the accuracy of the receipts, expenditures, and all other bookkeeping records relating to that bingo session.

All bookkeeping records of bingo sessions or instant bingo shall be available for inspection and copying by the city and by state and county law enforcement personnel or their designees at all times that the bingo hall is open for business.

(Code 1984, § 4-19; Ord. No. 94-47, § 4, 8-23-1994; Ord. No. 2011-28, § 4, 7-26-2011) 
Sec. 8-23. - Same-For-profit bingo organization. 
    The for-profit bingo organization must keep complete financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and the for-profit bingo organization shall have no business or business purpose other than the operation of the bingo hall within the city. Funds of the for-profit bingo organization must be kept in a distinct bank account with the words "for profit bingo account - Melbourne" in its name. No interested party in the for-profit bingo organization, or any spouse, parent, sibling, or child of an interested party in the for-profit bingo organization, may be a designated member of any charity conducting bingo in a bingo hall. All money received from any source by the for-profit bingo organization must be deposited into the bank account within 24 hours of receipt. All expenditures of any sort made by the for-profit bingo organization shall be paid by pre-printed consecutively numbered checks written on the bank account of the for-profit bingo organization. All checks written on the for-profit bingo organization bank account must show the legal name of the payee. All bookkeeping records, including, but not limited to, bank statements, canceled checks, check books, deposit tickets and receipts, and all leases and agreements shall be maintained by the for-profit bingo organization on the premises of the bingo hall for a period of no less than three years. Since it is the intent of the state law regulating bingo that all profits from bingo operations are to go to charity, the for-profit bingo organization must not charge for rental or sale of property or equipment or supplies any more than is ordinary and customary in the county area for the sale or rental of property, equipment or supplies under similar circumstances. For instance, rental terms for equipment would be compared to long-term rentals rather than short-term or transitory rentals, and since rental of property and equipment is utilized by more than one charity in the bingo hall, the costs for rental of property and equipment would be equitably divided among the various charities operating within the bingo hall. In the event an audit by a state CPA designated by the city of the records of the for-profit bingo organization reveals charges to the charities in excess of what is ordinary and customary in the county area, as determined by the auditor designated by the city, the for-profit bingo organization shall equitably refund the difference to the charities operating in the bingo hall. In the event the for-profit bingo organization wishes to appeal the determination of the auditor designated by the city, it may file a notice of appeal with the city along with a certified audit by a state licensed CPA upon which the for-profit bingo organization is basing its appeal. A hearing before the city council shall be held within six weeks of receipt by the city of the notice of appeal and certified audit. The city may hire a third state CPA to review the audits previously conducted as to the records of the for-profit bingo organization and any other records deemed appropriate by such CPA firm, and the city council shall base the results of the appeal on the reports of the CPAs presented to the city. The cost of any and all audits conducted pursuant to this section shall be borne by the for-profit bingo organization. If the for-profit bingo organization wishes to appeal any determination by the city council under this section, it may appeal same to the court of appropriate jurisdiction in the county. All bookkeeping records of the for-profit bingo organization shall be available for inspection, auditing and copying by the city and by state and county law enforcement personnel or their designees at all times that the bingo hall is open for business, or upon request.

ARTICLE III. - RAVE CLUBS 

Sec. 8-67. - Legislative findings, intent, and purpose. 
(a)  The city hereby finds and determines, as a matter of fact, that the late night and all night rave clubs and similar forums of assembly, commonly referred to as "raves," are sites for the sale, possession and use of illicit drugs. 
(b)  The city also finds such raves expose drug activity to the uninitiated youth of our city, and such exposure to drug activity occurring at such raves is often found to result in drug addiction, overdose and death of both juveniles and adults. 
(c)  The city hereby finds raves provide an arena for predatory-type sexual crimes, thus, for the protection of our city's youth, juveniles should not congregate in such social settings with adults; additionally, regulation of raves is also necessary for the protection of adult victims of such crimes. 
(d)  The city hereby finds raves are oftentimes the sites for violent criminal activity, as well as street gang activity as defined in F.S. ch. 874. 
(e)  The city hereby finds that the dangerous criminal activity occurring at such raves occurs predominately in the late night/early morning hours. 
(f)  The city hereby finds that the actions of rave patrons entering and exiting rave club establishments has a deleterious effect on nearby residential and commercial properties in terms of excessive noise, traffic and debris, and such impacts are exacerbated by the fact that rave patrons enter and exit such raves at extraordinarily late night/early morning hours when citizens have a reasonable expectation of peace and quiet. 
(g)  The city finds that the above-referenced problems associated with raves are unique and specific to such rave club establishments and are not prevalent in other types of unregulated places of assembly. 
(h)  It is the intent of the city to address the unique problems associated with raves by implementing rave club regulations for both juvenile and adult rave clubs to prevent rave club contact between juveniles and adults so as to prevent and/or reduce illicit or undesirable juvenile involvement and exposure to illegal drugs and dangerous criminal activity, and further to protect both juveniles and adults from criminal activity that occurs at such raves. 
(i)  The city hereby asserts that the following purposes of the rave club regulations set forth herein are matters of legitimate, substantial and compelling governmental interests: 
(1)  To protect juveniles and adults from illegal drug activity, including use, sale and drug abuse such as overdoses and to reduce, if not eliminate, such activity from occurring in rave clubs. 
(2)  To protect juveniles and adults from violent criminal activity occurring in rave clubs. 
(3)  To protect juveniles and adult victims from predatory type sexual crimes occurring in rave clubs. 
(4)  To protect juveniles and adults from gang-related activity occurring in rave clubs. 
(5)  To reduce the amount of criminal activity occurring predominately in the late night/early morning hours. 
(6)  To prevent the deleterious impacts of noise, traffic and debris on adjacent residential and commercial property that occur in the late night/early morning hours.

Sec. 20-66. - Intent to implement. 
    In order to implement and facilitate the plan hereby approved and adopted, it is found and determined that certain official action may be required by this city council with reference, among other things, to changes in zoning, the closing or vacating of streets, alleys and other public walkways, relocation of public facilities, the establishment of traffic patterns, the possible location or relocation of public utilities, lighting and utility lines and other public facilities, and the construction or addition of public parks and other public action, and accordingly the city council hereby: 
(1)  Pledges its cooperation in helping to carry out such plan;

Sec. 20-67. - Disavowal of eminent domain. 
    As a result of the public hearings before the city council, the city council finds that the public and citizens of the city are concerned that the powers conferred by F.S. §§ 163.370, 163.375, and 163.380 are sufficient to allow the city to use its eminent domain power to acquire by condemnation real property in the community redevelopment area for the purposes of resale of the property to private developers for redevelopment purposes. The city council specifically finds that the plan adopted hereby does not contemplate or provide for any such exercise of the eminent domain power of the city for such purposes, and specifically disavows any approval by implication or otherwise of such power by the adoption of this plan. Further, the city council specifically disavows its intention to exercise any such power in the community redevelopment area, and that passage of the ordinance from which this section derives approving the plan is specifically conditioned upon no such power being exercised by the city council in the future. In the event that city council in the future shall endeavor to exercise any power of eminent domain for the purpose of acquiring private property for reconveyance to private developers for redevelopment purposes, the approval of the plan encompassed by this section shall be automatically repealed.

Sec. 20-266. - Designation process and procedure. 
(a)  Design and construction criteria. Consistent with the criteria established by the National Register of Historic Places, the historic preservation board shall recommend for designation on the city register of historic places as individual historic resources, historic districts, archaeological sites and zones, those places, buildings, structures, objects, landscape features, archaeological sites, archaeological zones, and other improvements that are significant in the city's history, architecture, archaeology and culture, and that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship or association; and that meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Is associated with events that have made significant contributions to the pattern of history in the community, the county, the state or the nation. In order to justify eligibility for a property under the "events" criterion, the property must have an important association with the event or historic trend, and retain its historic integrity. Examples of properties associated with events could be the site of a battle, the building in which an important invention was developed; or an archaeological site at which a major new aspect of prehistory was discovered, such as the first evidence of man and extinct pleistocene animals being contemporaneous. Properties associated with a pattern of events could include a trail associated with migration; a railroad station that served as the focus of a community's transportation system and commerce; a building used by an important social organization, or a downtown district representing a town's growth as the commercial focus of the surrounding area. 
(2)  Is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past. In order to justify eligibility for a property under the "person" criterion, the property is usually associated with the person's productive life, reflecting the time period when he achieved significance. In some instances that may be the person's home; in other cases, a person's business, office, laboratory, or studio may best represent his contribution. Properties associated with a person significant in our past could include the home of an important merchant; the studio of a significant artist; or the business headquarters of an important businessperson. 
(3)  Recognizes the quality of design and construction and embodies the distinctive characteristics of an architectural type, period, style or method of construction; or the work of a prominent designer or builder; or contains elements of design, detail, materials, or craftsmanship of outstanding quality; or that represents a significant innovation or adaptation to the local state environment; or represents a distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction. In order to justify eligibility for a property under the "design and construction" criterion, the property must physically convey the qualities for which it is nominated. Distinctive characteristics refer to the physical features or traits that commonly recur in individual types, periods or methods of construction. Characteristics may be expressed in terms such as form, proportion, structure, plan, style or materials. They can be general, referring to ideas of design and construction such as basic plan or form, or they can be specific, referring to precise ways of combining particular kinds of materials. Properties associated with design and construction could include a residence or commercial building representing a significant style of architecture; a movie theater embodying high artistic value in its decorative features, or a bridge representing technological advances. 
(4)  Has yielded, or is likely to yield, historical or pre-historical information. In order to justify eligibility under the "information potential" criterion, the property must have, or have had, information to contribute to our understanding of human history or pre-history, and the information must be considered important. The site must retain the ability to convey its association as the repository of important information, the location of historic events, or the representation of important trends. 
(5)  Is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as established by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended). 
(6)  Is a part of or related to a landscape, park, environmental feature or other distinctive area, and should be developed or preserved according to a plan based upon a historical, cultural, or architectural motif; or because of its prominent or spatial location, contrast of siting, age, or scale is an easily identifiable visual feature of a neighborhood or the city and contributes to the distinctive quality of such neighborhood or the city. 
(b)  Criteria considerations. Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for designation as historic on the city register of historic places. However, such properties will qualify for designation if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria, or if they fall within the following categories: 
(1)  A building or structure that has been removed from its original location but is significant primarily for architectural value, or is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event; 
(2)  A birthplace or grave of a local historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no appropriate site or building directly associated with his productive life; 
(3)  A cemetery that derives its primary significance from graves of persons of outstanding importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; 
(4)  A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan and no other building or structure with the same association has survived; 
(5)  A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; 
(6)  A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance; or 
(7)  A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance. 
(c)  Procedures for historic designation. The historic preservation board shall review all applications for designation of properties as historic resources, historic districts, and archaeological sites and zones, according to the following procedures: 
(1)  Individual designation as historic resource. 
a.  Application. The owner of any property in the city or the historic preservation officer may petition the historic preservation board for designation of the property as an individual resource by submitting an application for historic designation to the historic preservation board. An owner's application for designation of a property as a historic resource will not be deemed complete without the written and notarized consent of all owners of the subject property. The historic preservation board is empowered to initiate the designation process pursuant to this section by directing the historic preservation officer to prepare and submit a preliminary application to the board regarding a particular property. 
b.  Owner consent required. No property, site, building, structure, object, landscape feature or other real or personal property will be designated as a historic resource without the written consent of the property owners. The owner's consent shall be recorded in the official records of the county. If all owners of the subject property do not consent to designation of the subject property as a historic resource, then the board must deny the petition as submitted. 
c.  Board preliminary review. After the historic preservation board's preliminary review of the application, the owner consent and any additional relevant information, the board shall determine whether the historic preservation officer will prepare a designation report in accordance with this section. 
(2)  Historic district designation. 
a.  Preliminary interest. Upon the direction of the historic preservation board, the historic preservation officer will research properties and ownership to define the boundaries of a proposed historic district and will prepare a designation report, all in accordance with this section. 
b.  Boundaries of the historic district. In the case of an historic district, a process will be accomplished to determine the level of owner support for the designation. 
1.  The historic preservation officer will compile a complete list of the potentially "contributing" and "noncontributing" properties to be included within the proposed historic district. 
2.  The historic preservation officer or his designee shall hold a public workshop to determine the support of the property owners in the proposed district. Notice of the public workshop shall be mailed to all owners of record (as determined by the most current county tax rolls), by first class U.S. mail, postage prepaid. 
3.  No historic district may be created unless at least 50 percent of the lots in the proposed district reflect a contributing resource within the historic district. In the event a contributing resource within a designated historic district is deemed noncontributing after designation, such change in status of the individual property shall not require a change to the boundaries of a designated historic district. 
4.  No property, site, building, structure, object, landscape feature or other real or personal property will be designated as a contributing resource in the historic district without the written and notarized consent of the owners of the contributing resource. If all owners of the subject property do not consent to designation of the subject property as a contributing resource, then the board may include the subject property as a noncontributing resource within the historic district, but may not include the subject property as a contributing resource within the historic district. Property owner consent is not required to include a property as noncontributing within a designated historic district. 
c.  If more than 50 percent of the lots within a proposed historic district include contributing resources, the historic preservation officer shall submit a petition for designation as a historic district and a supporting designation report to the historic preservation board. 
(3)  Designation reports. Prior to the designation of an individual resource, a historic district, an archaeological site or zone, an investigation and designation report must be prepared by the historic preservation officer and filed with the historic preservation board. The designation report shall not be prepared without the consent of the historic preservation board. All designation reports must address the following: 
a.  Legal description, parcel identification number and tax account number of each property. 
b.  Historical, cultural, architectural or archaeological significance of the property and how the property fulfills the criteria for designation. 
c.  Boundaries for individual historic resources and archaeological sites and a recommendation of boundaries for historic districts and archaeological zones. When a district is recommended, the report must identify those properties that are not historically or architecturally contributing to the district. The properties identified as noncontributing shall not be subject to the requirements of the certificate of historic appropriateness process. District boundaries shall be drawn to encompass, but not exceed, the extent of the significant resources and land areas comprising the property. For example, in defining the boundaries for a residence, the boundary should be drawn so that it incorporates the footprint of the building as well as the yard, as the green space acknowledges the setting and context of the property. Buffer zones or acreage not directly contributing to the significance of the property shall not be included for purposes of identifying individual historic resources or contributing resources in a historic district. 
d.  Zoning regulations. Every historic resource and historic district designation report may include detailed zoning regulations compatible with its designation. Such regulations may be designed to supplant or modify elements of existing zoning regulations, including, but not limited to, floor/area ratio, density, height, setbacks, parking, minimum lot size and transfer of development rights, or create any additional regulations provided for in this section. The zoning amendment may identify individual properties, improvements, landscape features, or sites; or categories of properties, improvements, landscape features or sites for which different regulations, standards and procedures may be required. In zoning districts in which historic resources as defined by this article are located, regulations for both the zoning district and the historic preservation code shall apply only to the designated historic resources within the zoning district. Whenever the regulations of the overall zoning district and the historic preservation board conflict, the regulations of the zoning district will apply. 
e.  Current conditions. All reports shall be based on the existing conditions of the property, and shall address whether or not the historic integrity of the property has been maintained. 
f.  Location map. The report shall also contain a location map and photographs of all exterior surfaces and interior if applicable. 
g.  Optional designation of interiors. Normally interior spaces shall not be subject to regulation under this section. However, in cases of existing structures having exceptional architectural, artistic or historical importance, interior spaces that are normally open to the public may be specifically designated. The designation report shall describe precisely those features subject to review. 
(4)  Other relevant information. The historic preservation officer or his designee shall provide the historic preservation board with evidence of the required notices of the public hearing, evidence of the required owner consent, and other relevant information not otherwise included in the designation report. 
(5)  Public hearing. For each historic resource, historic district, archaeological site and zone proposed for designation, where the required consent of the contributing property owner has been established and the designation report has been completed, a public hearing shall be held by the historic preservation board to determine the eligibility of the property for designation on the city register of historic places. All interested persons shall be given an opportunity to be heard at the public hearing on the proposed designation. 
(d)  Procedures for notifications and hearings on proposed designations. The notice of public hearing, provided pursuant to this section, shall serve as notification of the intent of the historic preservation board to consider designation of the subject property as historic on city register of historic places. 
(1)  Notification of owners. The historic preservation officer shall, at least 15 days prior to a public hearing held pursuant to this section, mail a notice of public hearing to all property owners of record, as follows: 
a.  For all consenting owners of subject properties, to the address identified on the written owner consent. 
b.  For all designations, including both contributing and noncontributing properties in a historic district, to the name and address of the latest ad valorem tax records as published by the county property appraiser. 
(2)  Courtesy notice. At least 15 days prior to a public hearing held pursuant to this section, a courtesy notice of the public hearing on proposed designations shall also be mailed to property owners of record within a 500-foot radius of the proposed historic resource, historic district, archaeological site or zone. Failure to receive such courtesy notice shall not invalidate the same as such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and county. 
(3)  Notification to general public. Notice of the public hearing shall be given by publishing notice of the time and place of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and the county at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. 
(4)  Notification to community redevelopment agencies and community redevelopment advisory committees. In the event the proposal involves properties within an existing community redevelopment area, the associated community redevelopment agency and community redevelopment agency advisory committee shall receive notice of the public hearing at least 30 days prior to the date of the public hearing. 
(5)  Notification to staff. Notification shall be given to the community development department and the code compliance division of the city. 
(e)  Moratorium on permitting. Upon recommendation by the historic preservation board to city council, a moratorium shall be put in place for individual resources and contributing resources within a district recommended for designation as historic on the city register of historic places. No permits shall be issued by the city for any new construction, alteration, rehabilitation, renovation, restoration, relocation or demolition during such moratorium on the subject properties, unless the proposed resource obtains a certificate of historic appropriateness pursuant to section 20-268. A moratorium shall not apply to noncontributing resources in a proposed historic district. A moratorium shall be waived during emergency situations in accordance with section 20-268(w). The moratorium shall expire upon final administrative action by the city council as provided for in this article, except that in no event shall a moratorium exceed 180 days after the historic preservation board issues its recommendation. 
(f)  Decision of the historic preservation board. The historic preservation board shall make its decision to approve, deny or amend the proposed designation on the city register of historic places at the public hearing. It may also continue the matter for additional information or cause. Should the historic preservation board recommend the historic resource as eligible for designation pursuant to the criteria set forth in section 20-266(a) or (b), and provided the owners consent as required by this section, the recommendation shall be forwarded promptly to the city council for final consideration. Failure of the city council to act on the recommendation of the historic preservation board within 180 days shall be deemed a denial by city council of the proposed historic designation. 
(g)  Modification of zoning. For the designation of a district, or for the designation of individual resources, archeological sites and archeological zones that require a modification or variance in the zoning, including the adoption of site- or district-specific design guidelines, the historic preservation board must first send its recommendations to the planning and zoning board for its review. The planning and zoning board shall then send its recommendations along with the historic preservation board's recommendation to the city council for final approval. 
(h)  City council actions. The city council shall either approve, deny or approve with conditions the designation on the city register of historic places, and shall designate pursuant to the criteria set forth in subsection (a) or (c) of this section the property by resolution. The following parties shall be notified of its actions with a copy of the resolution: 
(1)  All affected city departments; 
(2)  The city clerk, who shall record such resolution in the official records of the county; 
(3)  Owner of the affected property and other parties having an interest in the property, if known; and 
(4)  Appropriate county and state official as per the requirements for certified local governments. 
(i)  Amendment or rescission. Subject to the same procedures used in the original designation of the city register of historic places, as amended from time to time, the city council may amend or rescind any designation provided: 
(1)  The property fails to comply with the criteria set forth in subsection (a) or (c) of this section; 
(2)  At the time of the designation on the city register of historic places, all owners of the subject individual resource did not consent to such designation; or 
(3)  At the time of the designation on the city register of historic places, all owners of the particular designated contributing resource in a historic district did not consent to such designation as a contributing resource, except that such shall not require modification to the boundaries of the designated historic district such that the subject resource shall be deemed a noncontributing resource within such district. 
(j)  Appeal of designation. A party aggrieved by a designation decision may appeal such decision to the city council in the manner provided for in this article. 
(Code 1984, § 10-229; Ord. No. 2006-30, § 1, 4-25-2006; Ord. No. 2014-35, § 4(10-229), 6-10-2014; Ord. No. 2016-22, § 2, 4-26-2016) 
Sec. 20-267. - Nomination to the national register of historic places. 
(a)  The historic preservation board complements the Florida National Register Review Board in the review of proposed nominations to the national register. National Register nomination proposals located in the city will be reviewed by the historic preservation board. The historic preservation board will develop or receive the documentation necessary to nominate properties to the national register. The board shall evaluate nomination proposals received for completeness in a timely manner. Should the nomination proposal not be technically complete, the board shall notify the proposal's sponsor in writing, identifying the technical deficiencies, within 30 days after receipt of the nomination proposal. If the nomination proposal is technically complete, the board shall place the item on its agenda for the next meeting or, should notification provisions outlined below make this impossible, for the earliest possible regular meeting. 
(b)  The historic preservation board shall notify by standard mail the following people and organizations of its intention to consider a nomination proposal. In all cases, such notification shall occur at least 30 days but not more than 75 days prior to the board meeting at which the nomination proposal will be considered.

(2)  City council and board of county commissioners. Within 30 days after receipt of the nomination proposal, the city council shall submit in writing to the historic preservation board a recommendation as to whether or not the property shall be nominated to the national register. 
(3)  State historic preservation officer. 
(c)  Nomination proposals shall be considered by the historic preservation board at a public meeting, and all votes on nomination proposals shall be recorded and made a part of the minutes. All nomination proposals shall be forwarded, with a record of official action taken by the board and the recommendation of the city council and board of county commissioners, to the state historic preservation officer within 30 days after the historic preservation board meeting at which they were considered. 
(d)  Any person or organization which supports or opposes the nomination of a property to the national register shall be afforded the opportunity to make its views known in writing. All such correspondence regarding a nomination proposal shall become part of the permanent record concerning that proposal and shall be forwarded with approved proposals to the state historic preservation officer. In the case of disapproved nomination proposals, letters of support or comment shall be made a part of the permanent record concerning that proposal, and a list of such letters shall accompany the official copy of the disapproved nomination proposal when it is forwarded to the state historic preservation officer. 
(e)  Nomination proposals to be considered by the historic preservation board shall be on file at city hall for at least 30 days but not more than 75 days prior to the board meeting at which they will be considered. A copy shall be made available by mail when requested by the public and shall be made available at a location of reasonable local public access so that written comments regarding a nomination proposal can be prepared. 
(f)  Historic preservation board review and notification procedures do not apply when a federal agency nominates a property under its ownership or control. The board is encouraged to coordinate with federal agencies to the extent practical in the consideration of such nominations. 
(Code 1984, § 10-230; Ord. No. 2006-30, § 1, 4-25-2006; Ord. No. 2014-35, § 5(10-230), 6-10-2014) 
Sec. 20-268. - Certificate of historic appropriateness. 
(a)  Regarding any architectural features, landscape features, or site improvements, no property, site, building, structure, object, landscape feature or other real property within the city which has been designated as historic on the city register of historic places may be erected, altered, restored, rehabilitated, renovated, excavated, relocated, or demolished until a certificate of historic appropriateness has been approved under the procedures in this article. The requirement to obtain a certificate of historic appropriateness shall not apply to those buildings or properties that have been classified as noncontributing lots in a designated historic district. Ordinary maintenance or repair, as defined by this article, does not require a certificate of historic appropriateness. Architectural features shall include, but not be limited to, the architectural style, scale, massing, siting, general design and general arrangement of the exterior of the building or structure, including the type, style and material and color of roofs, windows, doors, siding, masonry, porches, storefronts and other architectural features. Architectural features shall include, when applicable, interior spaces where interior designation has been given pursuant to section 20-266(d)(3)g. 
(b)  Procedure. All applications for required certificates of historic appropriateness shall be reviewed according to the procedures set forth in this section. The standard certificate of historic appropriateness is issued by either the historic preservation officer or the historic preservation board. The special certificate of historic appropriateness is issued by the historic preservation board. 
(c)  Regulated work items. 
(1)  For each of the regulated work items set forth below affecting architectural features, landscape features, or site improvements designated as historic on the city register of historic places, the following applies: 
a.  Ordinary maintenance. If the regulated work constitutes ordinary maintenance or repair, as defined in this chapter, the regulated work may be done without a certificate of historic appropriateness. 
b.  Standard certificate of historic appropriateness. A standard certificate of historic appropriateness is required for work that does not constitute ordinary maintenance or repair and is deemed to have a minimal impact to the subject historic resource or contributing resource within a historic district such that the work will result in the preservation of the original appearance and will meet the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and the applicable district-specific design guidelines on file in the community development department. Examples of work that may be considered to have minimal impact could include minor alterations to the rear of a historic structure that is not visible from the public right-of-way or the construction of a deck to the rear of a historic structure that does not obscure architectural features and that is easily removable. 
c.  Special certificate of historic appropriateness. A special certificate of historic appropriateness is required for work that does not constitute ordinary maintenance or repair and is deemed to have more than a minimal impact to the subject historic resource or contributing resource within a historic district. 
(2)  Regulated work. The following are regulated work items: 
a.  Abrasive cleaning. Cleaning of exterior walls by blasting with abrasive materials. 
b.  Awnings or canopies. Installation, modification or removal of awnings or canopies.

(d)  A required certificate of historic appropriateness shall be considered prerequisite to the issuance of any other permits required by law or this Code. The issuance of a certificate of historic appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits or approvals required by the city or any other government agency having jurisdiction. A building permit or other city permit shall be invalid if it is obtained without a certificate of historic appropriateness required for the proposed work. 
(e)  Landscape features and site improvements will include, but not be limited to, individual plants, such as a specimen tree, or groups of plants, such as a hedge, allee, agricultural field, planting bed, or naturally occurring plant community or habitat, walls, fences, signs, sidewalks, planters, driveways, paving and exterior lighting. 
(f)  No certificate of historic appropriateness will be approved unless the architectural plan for said construction, reconstruction, relocation, alteration, excavation, restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, or demolition is approved by the historic preservation board or the historic preservation officer, as provided in this section. 
(g)  Relocation of a building or structure will include, but not be limited to, moving a building or structure into or within any historic district, and moving a historic building or structure within or out of the city or any historic district, and will require the same review procedures as described in this section. Relocation of historic buildings and structures to other sites will not take place unless it is shown that their preservation on their existing or original sites is not consistent with the purposes of this article or would cause undue hardship to the property owner. 
(h)  Forms and fees. Applications for certificates of appropriateness must be made on forms provided by the historic preservation officer and must be submitted with a fee, payable to the city. 
(i)  Pre-application conference. Before submitting an application for a certificate of historic appropriateness, an applicant may confer, at such applicant's election, with the historic preservation officer to obtain information and guidance before entering into binding commitments or incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys, and historic data. The purpose of such conference is to further discuss and clarify preservation objectives and design guidelines. In no case, however, shall any statement or representation made prior to completion of official application review be binding on the city. 
(j)  Guidelines for review and issuance. 
(1)  In addition to adopted district- or resource-specific design guidelines, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation are hereby adopted as the standards by which applications for any certificate of historic appropriateness are to be measured and evaluated. In adopting these guidelines, it is the intent of this article to promote the proper maintenance, restoration, preservation, rehabilitation, or reconstruction appropriate to the property, and compatible contemporary designs, that are harmonious with the exterior architectural and landscape features of neighboring buildings, and streetscapes. The salient points of these standards are as follows: 
a.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
d.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be retained and preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
h.  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
i.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
j.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(2)  From time to time, the historic preservation board may adopt additional standards to preserve and protect special features unique to the city. Based on the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, the designation report, a complete application, any additional plans, drawings, photographs, and samples of materials to fully describe the proposed project, the historic preservation board may approve, with or without conditions, or deny the application for a certificate of historic appropriateness. 
(k)  Scope of review and general design considerations. The review of the exterior architectural features will include: 
(1)  The architectural style, scale, massing, siting and the general arrangement of the structure's exterior including: 
a.  The type and texture of building material; 
b.  The type, style and materials of roofs, windows, doors, siding, and signs; 
c.  Prominent architectural features such as porches, balconies, dormers, storefronts, and other important elements that comprise the overall design; and 
d.  The collective composition of these elements. 
(2)  In considering proposals for alterations to the exterior of historic buildings and structures and in applying development and preservation standards, the documented, original design of the building may be considered, among other factors. 
(3)  Demolition of historic resources or contributing resources within historic districts, sites, archaeological sites, archaeological zones, buildings, structures, improvements, and appurtenances designated as historic on the city register of historic places shall be regulated by the historic preservation board. 
(l)  Visual compatibility within historic districts. Improvements to buildings, structures and appurtenances within a designated historic district shall be visually compatible. Visual compatibility is defined in terms of the following criteria: 
(1)  Height. The height of proposed buildings or modifications shall be visually compatible in comparison or relation to the height of existing structures and buildings. The goal of this consideration is to seek a visual harmony, so that no one element stands out in contrast to the collective character of the whole. 
(2)  Primary facade proportion. The front facade of each building or structure (or in the case of corner or isolated buildings, multiple facades) shall be visually compatible with and in direct relationship to the width of the building and to the height of the primary elevation of other adjacent or adjoining buildings within a historic district. Visual compatibility is measured by the absence of elements that stand out as intrusions to the general character of the streetscape. 
(3)  Proportion of openings (windows and doors). The openings of any building within a historic district shall be visually compatible with the openings exemplified by the prevailing historic architectural styles within the district. The relationship of the width of windows and doors to the height of windows and doors among buildings within the district will be visually compatible. Frequently a geometry is created along a streetscape by the dimensions of the openings within a building's mass. The objective of this design consideration is to maintain that geometry. 
(4)  Rhythm of solids to voids of front facades. The relationship of solids to voids in the front facade of a building or structure shall be visually compatible with the front facades of historic buildings or structures within the district. 
(5)  Rhythm of buildings on streets. The relationship of buildings to open space between it or them and adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible with the relationship between historic sites, buildings, and structures within a historic district. This consideration generally addresses uniform setbacks that are a part of a neighborhood's character. 
(6)  Rhythm of entrances and/or porch projections. The relationship of entrances and porch projections to the sidewalks of a building shall be visually compatible with the prevalent architectural styles of entrances and porch projections on historic sites, buildings and structures within a historic district. This consideration again references the operation of geometry in its establishment of visual continuity along a streetscape. 
(7)  Relationship to materials and texture. The relationship of materials and texture of the facade of a building shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in the historic sites, buildings and structures within a historic district. In other words, a district that is predominantly composed of wood frame houses would not benefit from the introduction of a masonry material. 
(8)  Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building or structure shall be visually compatible with the roof shape of a historic site, building or structure within a historic district. 
(9)  Walls of continuity. Appearances of a building or structure, such as walls, wrought iron, fences, evergreen landscape masses, or building facades, shall form cohesive walls of enclosure along a street to ensure visual compatibility of the building to historic buildings, structures or sites to which it is visually related. The objective here is to maintain the perimeter of the historic district by maintaining a relationship between the height and material used to frame a property boundary. 
(10)  Scale of building. The size of a building, the building mass in relation to open spaces, windows, door openings, balconies and porches shall be visually compatible with the building size and building mass of historic sites, buildings and structures within a historic district. 
(11)  Directional expression of primary elevation. A building shall be visually compatible with the buildings, structures and sites in its directional character: vertical, horizontal or non-directional. 
(m)  Standard certificate of historic appropriateness. The historic preservation officer reviews and issues standard certificates of appropriateness, subject to guidelines for review and issuance set forth in subsection (j) of this section. Within ten business days from the receipt of a complete application, the historic preservation officer shall approve or deny the application. The findings of the historic preservation officer shall be mailed to the applicant, accompanied by a statement that explains the officer's decisions. The applicant shall have the opportunity to challenge the officer's decision by applying for a special certificate of historic appropriateness within 30 days of the officer's findings. Further, the applicant may initially request that his application be classified as a special certificate of historic appropriateness so that the historic preservation board will consider it. A standard certificate of historic appropriateness shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of approval. After one year, the applicant must reapply for a new certificate of historic appropriateness and will be subject to any changes in the historic preservation board's design guidelines that took effect during the intervening period. 
(n)  Special certificate of historic appropriateness. The historic preservation board reviews and issues special certificates of appropriateness, subject to guidelines for review and issuance set forth in this section. A special certificate of historic appropriateness shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of approval. After one year, the applicant must reapply for a new certificate of historic appropriateness and will be subject to any changes in the historic preservation board's design guidelines that took effect during the intervening period. When the action proposed involves a special certificate of historic appropriateness, the following procedures shall govern: 
(1)  Time limit and public hearing. The historic preservation board shall act upon an application within 45 days of receipt of a completed application. The historic preservation board shall hold a public hearing with notice of the application and the time and place of the hearing as follows: 
a.  The applicant shall be notified at least ten calendar days prior to the meeting. 
b.  Any individual or organization requesting such notification and paying any established fees therefor shall be notified by mail at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. 
c.  A courtesy notice shall be mailed to the owner of record for properties within a 500-foot radius of the affected property using addresses as set forth in the most recent copy of the ad valorem real property tax rolls prepared by the county property appraiser. Failure to receive such notice shall not invalidate the same as such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and county. 
d.  An advertisement shall be placed in a newspaper at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. 
(2)  At the public hearing, the historic preservation board shall approve, deny, or approve with conditions, subject to the acceptance of those conditions by the applicant. The historic preservation board may suspend action on the application for a period not to exceed 45 days in order to seek technical advice from outside its members or to further meet with the applicant to revise or modify the application. 
(3)  The findings of the historic preservation board shall be mailed to the applicant within ten days of the historic preservation board's decision accompanied by a statement in full regarding the historic preservation board's decision. 
(4)  In the event the historic preservation board denies any completed application, the applicant may appeal the historic preservation board's decision to the city council in the manner provided for in this article. 
(o)  Records. The decision of the historic preservation board shall be issued in writing. Evidence of approval of the application shall be the issuing of a certificate of historic appropriateness by the historic preservation board or the historic preservation officer. Notice in writing of the historic preservation board's decision shall be given to the applicant, the director of the community development department and the city clerk. When an application is denied, the historic preservation board's notice shall provide an adequate written explanation of its decision. The historic preservation board shall keep a written record showing its action on each motion considered. 
(p)  Changes in approved work. Any change in work proposed subsequent to the issuance of a certificate of historic appropriateness shall be reviewed by the historic preservation officer. 
(1)  If the historic preservation officer finds that the proposed change does not materially affect the historic character, or the proposed change is in accord with approved guidelines, standards, and the certificate that was previously approved, the historic preservation officer may approve the change and amend the current certificate of historic appropriateness. 
(2)  If the historic preservation officer finds that the proposed change materially affects the historic character, or the change is not in accordance with guidelines, standards, or the certificate of historic appropriateness previously approved by the historic preservation board, a new certificate of historic appropriateness shall be required. The same time limits, notification procedures and all other procedural requirements shall be met, as the application is considered a new application. 
(q)  Demolition. Demolition of a historic resource shall require a special certificate of historic appropriateness. 
(1)  Review of any certificate of historic appropriateness for demolition shall be in accordance with criteria set forth in this section. 
a.  The historic preservation board may grant a certificate of historic appropriateness to demolish with a deferred effective date of up to 18 months from the date of the historic preservation board's decision after a public hearing. The effective date shall be determined by the historic preservation board based upon the relative significance of the structure and the probable time required to arrange a possible alternative to demolition. During the demolition deferral period, the historic preservation board may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve the structure in accordance with the purposes of this article. Such steps may include, but shall not be limited to, consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested persons, recommendations for acquisition of property by public or private bodies or agencies, and exploration of the possibility of moving one or more structures or other features. After the specified expiration date of the deferred certificate of historic appropriateness, a demolition permit shall be issued if requested by the applicant. 
b.  No decision of the historic preservation board shall result in undue economic hardship for the property owner. The historic preservation board shall have authority to determine the existence of such hardship in accordance with the provisions established in section 20-269. 
c.  The historic preservation board's refusal to grant a certificate of historic appropriateness for the purpose of demolition will be supported within 15 calendar days by a written statement describing the public interest that the historic preservation board seeks to preserve. 
d.  In connection with any certificate of historic appropriateness for demolition of buildings or improvements, the historic preservation board may encourage the salvage and preservation of building materials or architectural details and ornaments, fixtures and the like for reuse in restoration of other historic properties. 
e.  The historic preservation board may also require, at the owner's expense and prior to demolition, the recording of the building for archival purposes by photographs. 
(2)  In addition to all other provisions of this article, the historic preservation board shall consider the following standards in evaluating applications for a certificate of historic appropriateness for demolition of designated sites or buildings within a designated historic district in order to determine their relative significance, and therefore the length of the moratorium: 
a.  Is the structure of such interest or quality that it would reasonably meet national, state, regional or local criteria for designation as a significant historic or architectural site or structure? 
b.  Is the structure of such design, craftsmanship or material that it could be reproduced only with great difficulty or expense? 
c.  Is the structure one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the city, county or region? 
d.  Does the structure contribute significantly to the historic character of a designated district? 
e.  Would retention of the structure promote the general welfare of the city by providing an opportunity for study of local history, architecture and design or by developing an understanding of the importance and value of a particular culture and heritage? 
f.  Are there definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what will be the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area? 
(3)  Affirmative maintenance. A property owner shall not permit a historic resource or a contributing resource within a designated historic district to fall into a state of disrepair that may result in the deterioration of exterior appearance or architectural features so as to produce or tend to produce, in the judgment of the historic preservation board, a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a whole or upon the life and character of the resource in question. 
(4)  Special notice requirements. Notice of application for a certificate of historic appropriateness for demolition shall be posted on the premises of the building, structure or appurtenance proposed for demolition in a location and manner clearly visible from the street. Such notice will be posted within three working days of receipt of the application for demolition by the historic preservation board. 
(r)  Moving existing structures. An individually designated historic resource or a contributing resource within a historic district may not be relocated without a certificate of historic appropriateness. In considering such certificate, the historic preservation board shall determine whether or not any reasonable alternative is available for preserving the improvement or structure on its original site and whether or not the proposed relocation site is compatible with the historic setting and architectural integrity of the improvement or structure. 
(s)  Removal or destruction of existing landscape features. No certificate of historic appropriateness shall be granted for removal, relocation, concealment or effective destruction by damage of any landscape features or vegetation especially designated as significant within the boundaries of an individual historic resource or historic district unless one or more of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The designated landscape feature or site is located in the buildable area or yard area where a structure may be placed and unreasonably restricts the permitted use of the property. 
(2)  The designated vegetation is inappropriate in a historical context or otherwise detracts from the character of a district. 
(3)  The designated vegetation is diseased, injured or in danger of falling and reasonably interferes with utility service, creates unsafe vision clearance or conflicts with other applicable laws and regulations. 
(4)  As a condition for issuance of the certificate of historic appropriateness, the applicant may be required to relocate or replace designated vegetation. 
(5)  The designated vegetation is referenced on the current Florida Exotic Pest Plant List and its removal is required by law. 
(t)  Certificate to dig. For the purposes of this article, an archeological zone shall be defined as an area in which the likelihood of evidences of past cultures remaining in situ (i.e., undisturbed under or partially under the surface) is high: 
(1)  Within an archeological zone, any construction, placement of utilities, stormwater retention, filling, digging, removal of trees, or any other activity that may alter or reveal an interred archeological site shall be prohibited without a type of certificate of historic appropriateness called a certificate to dig. 
(2)  All applications to the city, and any work done by the city itself or utility companies, involving construction, large-scale digging, the removal of trees or any other activity that may reveal or disturb an interred archeological site, in an archeological zone shall require a certificate to dig before approval. 
(3)  The certificate to dig may be subject to specified conditions, including, but not limited to, conditions regarding site excavation. In order to comply with this requirement, the city may require the applicant to conduct an archeological survey by an archeologist approved by the historic preservation board. 
(4)  All construction requiring surface intrusion of known archeological sites require a Phase I archeological survey, as defined by the Florida Bureau of Historical Resources, to determine the extent of the archeological site relative to the proposed construction and to recommend plans for mitigating damage to the site. Completed surveys shall be submitted by the historic preservation board to the Florida Bureau of Historical Resources, archeological compliance review for concurrence or further recommendation. 
(5)  The state, based on the results of the Phase I archeological survey, may recommend any of the following: 
a.  If the important historical record cannot be preserved, encapsulating the affected portion of the site with fill and constructing above the fill may be an option. 
b.  If the owner proposes destroying a portion of or the entire site, a recommendation for complete salvage excavation may be made. 
c.  An excavation sampling of the affected portions of the site may be another option. 
(6)  The city council may elect to approve the recommendations, alter the recommendations, or even disregard the recommendations, except in sites containing human remains, marked or unmarked. 
(7)  The archeological survey/review shall take place during the time specified by the city after preliminary development plans have been submitted by the owner for review. The review and notification time limits for these certifications shall be the same as for a regular certificate of historic appropriateness. 
(8)  No certificate to dig shall be issued until impacts to archeological sites have been adequately reviewed, evaluated, and approved by the city. Copies of the approved survey will be forwarded to the Florida Bureau of Historic Resources, compliance review, and the county historical commission. 
(9)  Based on the recommendations of the state-certified archeologist and concurrence or further recommendation by the Florida Bureau of Historic Preservation Compliance Office, site development may proceed, further testing may be recommended, site mitigation may be implemented, or there may be a combination of the above. The city has the option to concur with the bureau's recommendations, except in the case of human remains, which shall not be disturbed without prior state and/or federal approval. 
(10)  Approved certificates to dig shall contain an effective date not to exceed 180 days at which time the proposed activity may begin, unless the historic preservation board designates the site in question as an individual historic site or a contributing resource within a historic district pursuant to this article in which all the rules and regulations pertaining to the designation process shall apply from the date the designation report has been filed. 
(u)  Building permits not to be issued. No building permit shall be issued by the building official that affects any historical resource or a contributing resource within a historic district (including archaeological sites or zones) in the city without a certificate of historic appropriateness as required by this article. 
(v)  Compliance of work with certificate of historic appropriateness standards. All work performed pursuant to the issuance of any certificate of historic appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of the certificate. The city manager or his designee shall assist the historic preservation board by making necessary inspections in connection with enforcement of this article and the inspector shall be empowered to issue a stop work order if performance is not in accordance with the issued certificate. No work shall proceed as long as a stop work order continues in effect. Copies of inspection reports shall be furnished to the historic preservation board and copies of any stop work orders shall be furnished to both the historic preservation board and the applicant. The building official and staff for the historic preservation board shall be responsible for ensuring that any work not in accordance with an issued certificate of historic appropriateness shall be corrected to comply with the certificate of historic appropriateness prior to withdrawing the stop work order. 
(w)  Emergency; temporary measures. For the purpose of remedying emergency conditions determined to be dangerous to life, health or property, nothing contained herein shall prevent the making of any temporary construction, reconstruction or other repairs to a building or site, pursuant to an order of a government agency or a court of competent jurisdiction. The owner of a building damaged by fire or natural calamity shall be permitted to stabilize the building immediately without historic preservation board approval, and to rehabilitate it later under the normal review procedures in this article. 
(x)  Power of review. The historic preservation board shall have the authority to review applications for certificates of appropriateness and certificates to dig for designated historic resources and contributing resources in historic districts (including archeological sites and zones) as set forth in this section. The purpose of this article shall apply equally to plans, projects or work executed or assisted by any private party, governmental body or agency, department, authority or historic preservation board of the city, county, or state, unless otherwise prohibited by law. 
(Code 1984, § 10-231; Ord. No. 2006-30, § 1, 4-25-2006; Ord. No. 2014-35, § 6(10-231), 6-10-2014; Ord. No. 2016-22, § 2, 4-26-2016) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-22, § 2, adopted April 26, 2016, changed the title of § 20-268 from "Certificate of appropriateness" to read as herein set out. 
Sec. 20-269. - Administration and enforcement. 
(a)  Variances or waivers. The historic preservation board shall have the power to recommend, with or without conditions, variances or waivers to requirements of the underlying zoning district of those properties designated as a historic resource and designated as a contributing or noncontributing resource located within a historic district. This historic preservation board shall recommend such variances or waivers only upon request for a recommendation from the owners of the property designated as historic on the city register of historic places. 
(1)  The board shall forward its recommendations for variances of individually designated historic resources to the zoning board of adjustment and planning and zoning board, as applicable. 
(2)  The board shall forward its recommendations for administrative waivers of properties within a designated historic district to staff as outlined in appendix B, section 8 (administrative waivers). 
(b)  Ordinary maintenance and repair. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of a building or structure nor prevent ordinary maintenance of landscape features. 
(c)  Enforcement of maintenance and repair provisions. 
(1)  Where the historic preservation board or historic preservation board's staff determines that any improvement within a designated historic site or historic district is endangered by lack of maintenance and repair, or that other improvements in visual proximity to a historic site or historic district lack maintenance and repair to such an extent as to detract from the desirable character of the historic site or historic district, such determination shall be reported to the code compliance division. 
(2)  The code compliance division will work with the historic preservation board and staff to ensure such maintenance meets not only city code, but also this article. 
(d)  Unsafe structures. In the event the building official determines that any building or structure designated as historic on the Melbourne register of historic places is unsafe, as determined by the building code, appendix D, article III, such building official shall immediately notify the historic preservation officer with a copy of any findings. Where reasonably feasible, within applicable laws and regulations, the code compliance division shall endeavor to encourage repair of the structure rather than its demolition and shall take into consideration any comments and recommendations by the historic preservation officer and board. The historic preservation board may take appropriate action to encourage preservation of any such structure. 
(e)  Undue economic hardship. Undue economic hardship may be considered only after a property has been designated or after an application for approval to alter or demolish a structure has been denied by the historic preservation board. In any instance in which there is a claim of undue economic hardship, the owner shall submit, by affidavit, to the historic preservation board, within ten days after the public hearing at which an application was denied, the following information: 
(1)  For all property. 
a.  The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the party from whom purchased. 
b.  The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon, according to the two most recent assessments. 
c.  Real estate taxes for the previous two years. 
d.  Annual debt service, if any, for the previous two years. 
e.  All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the owner or applicant in connection with his/their purchase, financing or ownership of the property. 
f.  Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and offers received, if any. 
g.  Any consideration by the owner as to profitable adaptive uses for the property. 
h.  Estimates for repair using modern materials and, for comparison, estimates for historical reproduction. 
(2)  For income-producing property. 
a.  Annual gross income from the property for the previous two years; 
b.  The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon, according to the two most recent assessments; 
c.  Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two years; and 
d.  Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years. 
(3)  The historic preservation board may require that an applicant furnish such additional information believed to be relevant in the determination of undue economic hardship and may provide, in appropriate instances, that such additional information be furnished under oath or seal. 
(4)  In the event that any of the required information is not reasonably available to the property owner and cannot be obtained by the property owner, the property owner shall file with his/their affidavit a statement of the information that cannot be obtained and the reasons why such information cannot be reasonably obtained. When such unobtainable information concerns required financial information, the property owner will submit a statement describing estimates that will be as accurate as are feasible. 
(f)  Appeals. 
(1)  Within 20 days of the rendition of the written decision of the historic preservation board, an aggrieved party may appeal the decision by filing a written notice of appeal, and an appeal fee, if any, as set by the city council from time to time by resolution, payable to the city. The notice of appeal shall state the decision that is being appealed, the grounds for the appeal, and a brief summary of the relief that is sought and shall be filed with the secretary to the historic preservation board. The city council shall conduct a public hearing at which time city council may affirm, modify, or reverse the historic preservation board's decision. The decision of the city council shall constitute final administrative review, and no petition for rehearing or reconsideration shall be considered by the city. 
(2)  Nothing contained herein shall preclude the city council from seeking additional information prior to rendering a final decision. The decision of the city council shall be in writing and a copy of the decision shall be forwarded to the historic preservation board and the appealing party. 
(g)  Violations. 
(1)  Violations of this article shall be subject to enforcement by the code enforcement board of the city. Failure by an owner of record or any other individual or private or public entity to comply with any provisions of this article shall constitute a violation hereof and shall be punishable by penalties for each day the violation continues. Any person who carries out or causes to be carried out any work in violation of this article shall also be required to restore the subject improvement, landscape feature or site, either to its appearance prior to the violation or in accordance with a certificate of historic appropriateness approved by the historic preservation board. 
(2)  In addition, a stop work order shall be issued by the building official in any case where work has commenced, or preparation for work has commenced, which requires a certificate of historic appropriateness under this section and where no such certificate has been obtained. The stop work order shall be issued to the property owner, the occupant or any person, company or corporation commencing work or preparation for work in violation of this section. The stop work order shall remain in full force and effect until a certificate of historic appropriateness has been obtained and posted on the property, or it has been determined by the historic preservation officer that no certificate of historic appropriateness is required. 
(h)  Incentives. All properties designated as individual sites or as designated properties within a district shall be eligible, upon application by the owner, for any available financial assistance set aside for historic preservation by the city contingent on the availability of funds and the scope of the project as described in the application. 
(i)  Notification to division of pending amendments. The Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, shall be provided with any proposed amendment of this article for review and comment at least 30 days prior to final adoption. 
(Code 1984, § 10-232; Ord. No. 2006-30, § 1, 4-25-2006; Ord. No. 2014-35, § 7(10-233), 6-10-2014; Ord. No. 2015-45, § 3, 9-8-2015; Ord. No. 2016-22, § 2, 4-26-2016) 
Sec. 20-270. - Eau Gallie Historic District. 
(a)  Generally. The intent of this section is to identify a geographically defined area, to be known as the "Eau Gallie Historic District," as possessing a significant concentration, linkage or continuity of buildings, structures, improvements or landscape features united by historic events or aesthetically by plan or physical development. The Eau Gallie Historic District is significant for its collection of early 20th Century architecture and for its role in the city's development history.

Sec. 22-33. - Official census for apportionment of city council districts; definitions. 
(a)  The United States Decennial Census of 2010 is the official census of the city for the purposes of this article apportioning city council member districts. 
(b)  The following delineation of areas to be included in each city council district employs the official census divisions, tracts, block numbering areas, block groups, and blocks used by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, in compiling the United States Decennial Census of 2010 in this state. The populations within these census geographic units are the population figures reported in the counts of the United States Decennial Census of 2010 provided to the state in accordance with Public Law No. 94-171. Certain spatial differences exist between the Census Bureau's Geographic Information Systems (GIS) shapefiles and the city's GIS shapefiles. These differences cause some census block boundaries to not be spatially exact. In such circumstances, the census block boundaries were analyzed and the appropriate adjustments were made to include any person in the appropriate city council district.

Sec. 24-20. - Notice of existence of alarm system. 
(a)  Private residential security and fire protection alarm system. It is not the intent of the city that owners be required to comply with the provisions of articles II and III of this chapter; therefore, every person who owns, leases, possesses or operates a private residential alarm system that includes both security and fire protection shall follow the requirements of article III of this chapter. 
(b)  Fire alarm system. Every person who owns, leases, possesses or operates any alarm system within the city, whether the same exists on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or whether the same is installed thereafter, shall, within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or within the same period of time after a new alarm system is initially installed, notify the enforcement official, on forms to be provided by (and upon request made to) the enforcement official, of the existence of the alarm system. Notice shall include the following information: 
(1)  The name, address, business and home telephone number of the owner of the premises wherein the alarm system is installed.

Sec. 24-21. - Responsibility for false alarm, response, and corrective action; exception. 
(a)  Responsibility. For the purposes of this article, the responsibility for a false alarm shall be that of the owner of the premises in which the alarm system is installed. A response to a false alarm shall result when any member of the fire or police department responds by traveling to the premises where the alarm has been activated. After responding to a false alarm the responding official shall notify any person identified in the notice required pursuant to section 24-20(b), of the activation of the alarm system and such person shall thereupon travel to the premises to deactivate the alarm system. Should the person notified fail to appear at the premises to deactivate the alarm system within one-half hour after being notified to do so, the city shall charge the owner of the premises a fee of $50.00. This fee may be waived by the enforcement official for exigent circumstances if response time beyond one-half hour is reasonable. Upon the enforcement official's refusal to waive the foregoing fine, the enforcement official shall notify the owner of the owner's right to an appeal as set forth in section 24-24. Additionally, the owner of the premises wherein the alarm system is installed shall make a written report within seven calendar days of the date of the false alarm on forms provided by the enforcement official, setting forth the cause of the false alarm, the corrective action taken and the name, address and telephone number of any maintenance, repair or serviceman who inspected or repaired the alarm system following the false alarm, as well as such other information as the enforcement official may deem is reasonably necessary to determine the cause of the false alarm, the corrective action taken or required in order to correct the cause of the same. 
(b)  Exception. If an alarm contractor causes a false alarm during the servicing, repairing, testing or inspection of an alarm system, the alarm installation company may be assessed a $50.00 fine if the fire department personnel responding to the false alarm determine that an on-site employee of the alarm installation company directly caused the false alarm. In this situation, the false alarm will not be counted against the alarm user. 
(Code 1984, § 20-52; Ord. No. 90-31, § 1, 7-24-1990; Ord. No. 2013-61, § 1(20-52), 11-26-2013) 
Sec. 24-22. - Fee charge; multiple false alarms. 
    In those instances when fire personnel respond to more than three false alarms at a premises within a one-year period, each response to a false alarm made by the city fire department within said one-year period shall constitute a separate offense, and the city shall charge the owner of the premises a fee of $100.00 for each such response to a false alarm in excess of three false alarms within the aforementioned one-year period. For each premises with a newly installed alarm system, the foregoing described one-year period shall commence upon the expiration of the six-month period described in section 24-28 and continue for 365 days thereafter (366 days for leap year), and each subsequent one-year period shall commence on the same day and month of each succeeding year thereafter as the day and month on which the initial one-year period commenced. For each premises with an alarm system existing on the effective date hereof, the foregoing described one-year period shall commence upon the effective date hereof, and continue for 365 days thereafter (366 days for leap year), and each subsequent one-year period shall commence on the same day and month of each succeeding year thereafter as the day and month on which the initial one-year period commenced.

Sec. 24-23. - Proper alarm system operation and maintenance. 
    An alarm system operator shall: 
(1)  Maintain the premises and the alarm system in a manner that will minimize or eliminate false alarm notifications, within the provisions of the current edition of the Florida Fire Prevention Code and adopted references; 
(2)  Respond or cause his representative to appear at the alarm site within a 30 minute response time, when notified by a representative of the city, to silence or reset a malfunctioning alarm system; and 
(3)  Not manually activate an alarm for any reason other than an occurrence of an event that the alarm system was intended to report.

Sec. 24-26. - System performance reviews. 
    If there is reason to believe that an alarm system is not being used or maintained in a manner that ensures proper operation and suppresses false alarms and/or alarm malfunctions, the enforcement official may require a conference with an alarm registration holder and the individual or association responsible for maintenance of the alarm system to review the circumstances of each false alarm/alarm malfunction. 
(Code 1984, § 20-57; Ord. No. 90-31, § 1, 7-24-1990; Ord. No. 2013-61, § 1(20-57), 11-26-2013) 
Sec. 24-27. - Automatic telephone dialing alarm device or digital alarm communicator system.

Sec. 26-56. - General requirements. 
(a)  Any use established or changed to, and any building, structure or land developed, constructed or used for any permitted principal use, or any use permissible as a conditional use, or any accessory use, shall comply with all the environmental standards herein set forth for the district involved. 
(b)  If any existing use or building or other structure is extended, enlarged, or reconstructed, the environmental standards for the district involved shall apply with respect to such extended, enlarged or reconstructed portions of such use, building, or other structure. 
(Code 1984, § 20-106; Ord. No. 2005-122, § 1, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 26-57. - Administration and enforcement of environmental standards. 
    Intent concerning determinations involved in administration and enforcement of environmental standards include: 
(1)  Determinations necessary for administration and enforcement of environmental standards set forth herein range from those that can be made with satisfactory accuracy by a reasonable person using normal senses and no mechanical equipment to those requiring great technical competence and complex equipment for precise measurement. It is the intent of this article that: 
a.  Where determination can be made by the building official, using equipment normally available to the city or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made before notice of violation issued. 
b.  Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes it unreasonable for the city to maintain the personnel or equipment necessary for making difficult or unusual determinations, the cost of proving to the building official that violations have not occurred shall rest with those responsible for the said violations. 
(2)  Applicable environmental standards. If the building official finds, after making determinations in the manner set forth in this article, that there is a violation of performance standards, he shall take or cause to be taken lawful action to cause correction to within the limits set by such environmental standards. 
(Code 1984, § 20-107; Ord. No. 2005-122, § 1, 11-8-2005)

(Code 1984, § 20-108; Ord. No. 2005-122, § 1, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 26-59. - Odor standards. 
    All uses shall be controlled to prevent the emission of odorous gases or other matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable or to produce a public nuisance or hazard at any point as measured along the lot lines. Detailed plans for the elimination of odorous matter may be required before the issuance of a building permit. 
(Code 1984, § 20-109; Ord. No. 2005-122, § 1, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 26-60. - Lighting. 
(a)  Lighting spillover standard. Any use, operation or activity on a lot must be conducted, operated and situated so that light spillover onto another lot used for residential purposes does not occur in excess of one footcandle. Lighting for parks from 6:00 a.m. until 12:00 midnight, public street lighting in the right-of-way at all times and residential security lights shall be exempt from this standard. 
(b)  Lighting spillover assessment. The light source will be measured with a light meter or photometer which measures light in footcandles. Measurement for compliance will be conducted by taking a sample measurement at or beyond any common lot (whether conforming or nonconforming) line at any vertical dimension not to exceed 20 feet without any light from the light source being investigated. This measurement shall be used to determine the amount of background light occurring. The light source being investigated shall then be measured at the same location and at the same vertical dimension. The first measurement shall then be subtracted from the second measurement to determine compliance or non-compliance with the standard of one footcandle. The first and second lighting measurements referred to herein shall be taken at substantially the same time of day. 
(c)  Measurements. In obtaining the measurement, the property owner shall, at the request of the building official or his designee, turn off the light source for such time as is necessary to complete the first measurement. Failure to comply with this request shall be prima facie evidence of violation of this section by the property owner. 
(Code 1984, § 20-110; Ord. No. 2005-122, § 1, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 26-61. - Glare. 
(a)  Direct glare standard. No light source on private property, regardless of zoning classification, shall be permitted to produce direct glare which results in visual discomfort for a normally located viewer on property in any abutting zoning district or on any public street or highway. 
(b)  Visual discomfort definition. As used in this section, the term "visual discomfort" shall refer to the viewing of a direct light source that is producing luminance which could cause annoyance, discomfort or loss in visual performance and visibility. 
(c)  Glare prohibited. Glare shall reflect away from abutting properties and shall not produce visual discomfort on abutting properties. The city may require the property owner of the site from which the offensive light source originates to illuminate all existing lights on the site during the site visit to make this determination. A violation of the direct glare standard shall be deemed a public nuisance and a violation of Code. 
(Code 1984, § 20-111; Ord. No. 2005-122, § 1, 11-8-2005; Ord. No. 2015-45, § 4, 9-8-2015) 
Sec. 26-62. - Electromagnetic radiation. 
(a)  Requirements. All uses shall be controlled to prevent any source of electromagnetic radiation which does not comply with the current regulations of the Federal Communications Commission regulations regarding such sources of electromagnetic radiation. Further, any operation in compliance with the Federal Communications Commission regulations shall not be permitted if such radiation causes an abnormal degradation in performance of other electromagnetic radiators or receptors of quality and proper design because of proximity, primary field, blanketing, spurious reradiation conducted energy in power or telephone systems or harmonic content. 
(b)  Method of measurement. For the purposes of determining the level of radiated electromagnetic interference, standard field strength measuring techniques interference transmitted or conducted by power or telephone lines, a suitable, turntable peak reading, radio frequency volt-meter shall be used. This instrument shall, by means of appropriate isolation coupling, be alternately connected from line to line and from line to ground during the measurement. 
(c)  Determination of electromagnetic interference. The determination of "abnormal degradation in performance," and "quality and property design" shall be made in accordance with good engineering practices as defined in the latest principles and standards of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and the Radio Manufacturers Association. In case of any conflict between the latest standards and principles of the above groups, precedence in the interpretation shall be in the following order: 
(1)  Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers; and 
(2)  Radio Manufacturers Association. 
For the purposes of determining the maximum allowable level of radiated electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic interference transmitted or conducted by power or telephone line, maximum allowable levels will be adopted by the city council upon recommendation by the city engineer.

The acceptance of the franchise granted pursuant to a franchise agreement by the utility shall be deemed an agreement on the part of the utility to indemnify the city, its officials, employees, and agents, all in their official and personal capacities, and hold it harmless against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense which may accrue to the city by reason of the negligence, default or misconduct of the utility, its agents, employees, contractors, subcontractors sub-subcontractors, laborers, any of their respective materialmen, or other third party arising from the construction, installation, operation, removal, repair, or maintenance of its facilities hereunder. The city agrees that neither it nor its officers, employees, or agents, all in their official and personal capacities, shall be indemnified to the percentage of its or their fault in an accident or other occurrence that city or its officers, employees, agents, or volunteers, all in their official and personal capacities, is responsible for in any incident for damages or injuries (including, but not limited to, injury or death) arising from the gross negligence and wanton, willful, and intentional misconduct of the grantor or its officers, employees, agent, or volunteers.

The exact franchise fee rate shall be negotiated by the city manager and city attorney and the utility. 
(b)  If during the term of this franchise, the utility or company related to the utility enters into a franchise agreement with any other municipality located in the county or within any contiguous county to the county, where the number of the utility's active electrical customers is 100,000 or less than the number of utility's active electrical customers within the city, the terms of which provide for the payment of franchise fees by the utility at a rate greater than any rate negotiated in the franchise issued by or to be issued by the city of the grantee's residential, commercial and industrial revenues, under the same terms and conditions as specified in subsection (a) of this section, the utility shall notify the city, shall negotiate and enter into an amended franchise agreement with the city in which the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments under subsection (a) of this section shall be equal to that percentage which the utility has agreed to use as a basis for the calculation of payments to such other municipality or other local government described above.

    The repeal of sections 13.5-74 and 13.5-76 through 13.5-88 of the 1984 city Code of Ordinances does not and shall not be interpreted as repealing in or otherwise terminating or invalidating the existing franchise agreement between the city and Florida Power & Light Co. ("FPL"), adopted on September 11, 2007, by Ordinance No. 2007-67, or any "side letter" of concessions by FPL.

(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter or trespass in a municipal parking garage or municipal surface parking lot, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals, under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
(b)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm or immediate concern is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object, or is determined by a law enforcement officer to be within a municipal parking garage or surface parking lot during such time as the parking garage or surface parking lot shall be closed to the general public and to which notice against entering or remaining within a municipal parking garage or surface parking lot between certain times of day or night is given, by posting of signage, fencing or structure. Unless flight by the person or other circumstance makes it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer did not comply with this procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person is true and, if believed by the officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern. 
(c)  Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of the offense of violating a municipal ordinance, punishable as provided in section 1-14.

State Law reference- Sexual predators and sexual offenders, F.S. §§ 775.21-775.26; sexual offender and sexual predator registration and information, F.S. §§ 943.043-943.0437. 

Sec. 40-27. - Findings. 
(a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, sexual offenders who prey on children, and sexual predators are sexual violators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual violators are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and many sexual violators commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual violator victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  The high level of threat that a sexual violator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the city with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes registration and tracking of sexual violators residing within the city in an effort to ensure that citizens, and, in particular children, are secure from the potential threats of sexual violators. 
(c)  The city has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual violators and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring an active registration and tracking program for sexual violators.

Sec. 42-2. - Purpose; findings; intent; authority; recitals; First Amendment protection. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promulgate rules and regulations regarding the use of city owned or controlled parks or recreational facilities in the interest of public health, safety and welfare. It is also the purpose of this chapter to establish rules and regulations regarding outdoor public assemblies including but not limited to large group feedings in order to regulate the time, place and manner of large group feedings while mindful of protecting any First Amendment rights related to outdoor public assemblies including but not limited to large group feedings. 
(b)  Findings. Based upon evidence presented to the city council regarding the use of public parks and other recreational facilities owned or controlled by the city and the evidence of the adverse secondary effects of large group feedings as well as the constitutional rights attendant to such large group feedings including but not limited to examination of relevant case law in the Eleventh Circuit including, but not limited to, the case of First Vagabonds Church of God v. City of Orlando, Florida, 638 F.3d 756 (11th Cir. 2011), as well as other matters, testimony and materials submitted at the public hearings relating this ordinance; and other matters and documents relating to all of the above; the city council makes the following findings: 
(1)  The city has formerly enacted this chapter to promulgate rules and regulations for governing its parks and recreation department including but not limited to rules and regulations governing the use of city-owned or controlled public parks and public facilities; 
(2)  The city has decided for the betterment of the public health, safety and welfare to amend this chapter to revise and amplify the rules governing the use of city-owned or -controlled parks and facilities and to change the name of the department to the parks and recreation department; 
(3)  The city encourages use of city-owned or -controlled parks by city residents in a safe, sanitary, and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere; 
(4)  Unregulated large group feeding in public parks owned or controlled by the city has resulted in litter on park grounds and surrounding rights-of-way such as food, food containers, and other food wrappings, creating hazards to the health, safety, and welfare of citizens, birds and animals, and is detrimental to the aesthetic atmosphere of parks; 
(5)  Large group feedings in public parks owned or controlled by the city require provision of adequate trash receptors and additional park personnel for inspection and cleanup of park grounds, which would be more manageable by advance notice and regulation of large group feedings through a permit system; 
(6)  The city is experiencing a steady and significant increase in residential and other growth and a corresponding competition for park space and usage by citizens; 
(7)  Excessive use of parks and park facilities in city-owned or controlled parks for large group feedings by single persons or groups denies that park or facility space for use by other citizens, which placement of reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on use for large group feedings would resolve; 
(8)  Testimony before city council has demonstrated that fear, intimidation, and criminal acts have accompanied or followed some large group feedings in some parks owned or controlled by the city, which has affected the health, safety and welfare of city residents; 
(9)  The city is committed to and has provided for and set aside reasonable, ample, alternative land space within parks owned or controlled by the city for large group feedings by religious and other organizations; 
(10)  The current parks and park facilities owned or controlled by the city and future parks owned or controlled by the city are particularly affected by all the foregoing conditions and confining large group feedings to only a few parks owned or controlled by the city without adequate time, place, and manner regulations as provided for by this ordinance would continue to adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city; 
(11)  Aesthetics of parks and other city property is a significant and important government interest; 
(12)  The safety of pedestrian traffic in city rights-of-way and parks is a significant and important government interest; 
(13)  The health, safety and welfare of citizens of the city is a significant and important government interest; and 
(14)  Preservation of improvements in urbanized environment which has been the subject of significant financial and other resources of the city is a significant and important government interest. 
(c)  Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to protect and preserve the good order, health, peace, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(d)  Authority. This chapter is enacted under the constitutionally derived power of the city in the interest of the good order, safety, health, peace and general welfare of the citizens of the city and its visitors. 
(e)  Recitals. It is the city council's further intention to accomplish those intents and purposes expressed by the city council in the recitals of the ordinance creating this section, which are incorporated by reference into this section. 
(f)  First Amendment protection. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or unreasonably restrict constitutionally protected rights. This chapter is intended where applicable to reasonably regulate the time, place and manner of outdoor public assemblies including but not limited to large group feedings.

(2)  Content. The application for a permit shall set forth the following information, and such other information as may from time to time reasonably be required:

The cost of repairing or replacing any damaged items or areas shall be deducted from the security deposit, and the balance remaining, if any, shall be returned to the permittee within 30 days of the date of the event. If the cost of repair or replacement exceeds the amount of the security deposit, the director shall invoice the permittee for the excess amount. The permittee shall pay such amount within ten days of his or her receipt of the invoice, and the permit holder shall not be eligible to apply for an outdoor public assembly permit until such amount is paid in full. 
d.  The permit fee and security deposit shall be waived by the director after consultation with other directors, if necessary, if the activity proposed by the applicant involves expressive speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; will occur in a public forum; the fees would be so financially burdensome that it would preclude the applicant from exercising First Amendment rights; and adequate alternate channels of expression are not available.

If additional police protection for the assembly is deemed necessary by the chief of police, he shall so inform the applicant for the permit.

Sec. 44-163. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions, including the portion of the member contributions for those who are members as of the effective date assumed by the city as of October 1, 1975, and paid on behalf of each member, and any future contributions actually required of members, plus interest at the rate of four percent per annum compounded annually as of each September 30, with interest being credited in full on the amount in each contribution account on September 30. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions without the crediting of interest of four percent per annum. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, determined on the basis of actuarial equivalency using assumptions adopted by the board such that benefit calculations are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means 1/12 of the average salary of the five best years of the last ten years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death or the career average as a full-time firefighter, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service. 
(1)  The term "credited service" means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a firefighter with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a firefighter. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the fire department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a firefighter, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the fire department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a firefighter with the fire department within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a firefighter shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the firefighter repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment. 
(2)  The years or fractional parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353), after separation from employment as a firefighter with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
a.  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
b.  The member returns to his employment as a firefighter within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service. 
c.  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this definition shall be five years. 
This definition is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this definition does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
(3)  In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Effective date means September 26, 1995. 
    Firefighter means an actively employed full-time person employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a firefighter as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 633.35, and whose duty it is to extinguish fires, to protect life and to protect property. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed firefighter who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future, shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Regular base salary means 1/12 of the employee's annual base pay rate plus any incentive pay. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry into the deferred retirement option plan. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a firefighter reported on the member's W-2 form plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost of living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). The term "compensation" means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an eligible employee shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. An "eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. Effective on March 24, 2015, salary shall exclude payments of overtime in excess of 300 hours per fiscal year, and shall exclude payments for accrued sick and annual leave; provided, for members employed on the effective date of this ordinance, salary shall include the lesser of the amount of sick and annual leave time accrued as of such effective date, or the actual amount of sick and annual leave time for which the member receives payment at the time of retirement. 
    Spouse means the lawful wife or husband of a member or retiree at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the City of Melbourne Firefighters' Retirement System, as contained herein, and all amendments thereto. 
    Treasury regulations means the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 44-165. - Board of trustees. 
(a)  The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibility for the proper operation of the system and for making effective the provisions of this article is hereby vested in a board of trustees. The board of trustees is hereby designated as the plan administrator. The board of trustees shall consist of five trustees, two of whom, unless otherwise prohibited by law, shall be legal residents of the city, who shall be appointed by the city council, and two of whom shall be members of the system, who shall be elected by a majority of the firefighters who are members of the system. The fifth trustee shall be chosen by a majority of the previous four trustees as provided for herein, and such person's name shall be submitted to the city council. The fifth member may be a city employee. Upon receipt of the fifth person's name, the city council shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the board of trustees as its fifth trustee. The fifth trustee shall have the same rights as each of the other four trustees appointed or elected as herein provided and shall serve a two-year term unless he sooner vacates the office. Each resident trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of two years, unless he sooner vacates the office or is sooner replaced by the city council at whose pleasure he shall serve. Each member trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of two years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the city as a firefighter or otherwise vacates his office as trustee, whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing trustee. Each trustee may succeed himself in office. DROP participants cannot be elected as, or vote for, elected trustees. The board shall establish and administer the nominating and election procedures for each election. The board shall meet at least quarterly each year. The board shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature, and description. 
(b)  The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect a chair and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the board. The trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and per diem as provided by law. 
(c)  Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board. Three affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board. A trustee shall abstain from voting as the result of a conflict and shall comply with the provisions of F.S. § 112.3143. 
(d)  The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal, and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the system. The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the system shall be paid from the fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. In the event the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. 
(e)  The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
(1)  To construe the provisions of the system and determine all questions arising thereunder. 
(2)  To determine all questions relating to eligibility and membership. 
(3)  To determine and certify the amount of all retirement allowances or other benefits hereunder. 
(4)  To establish uniform rules and procedures to be followed for administrative purposes, benefit applications and all matters required to administer the system. 
(5)  To distribute to members, at regular intervals, information concerning the system. 
(6)  To receive and process all applications for benefits. 
(7)  To authorize all payments whatsoever from the fund, and to notify the disbursing agent, in writing, of approved benefit payments and other expenditures arising through operation of the system and fund. 
(8)  To have performed actuarial studies and valuations, at least as often as required by law, and make recommendations regarding any and all changes in the provisions of the system.

(Code 1984, § 23-78; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006) 
Sec. 44-166. - Finances and fund management; establishment and operation of fund. 
(a)  As part of the system, there exists the fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system, including the assets of the prior firefighters' retirement system, including the assets of the Firefighters' Retirement System and Group Annuity Contract No. GA1379. 
(b)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(c)  All funds of the firefighters' retirement system may be deposited by the board with the director of finance of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the director of finance of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the director of finance or clearly identified as such funds of the firefighters' retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the firefighters' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(d)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(1)  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis; 
(2)  Receipts and disbursements; 
(3)  Benefit payments; 
(4)  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets attributable to contributions and deposits from the city; 
(5)  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever; and 
(6)  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(e)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant, for the most recent fiscal year of the fund. The audit shall be performed in accordance with state law. 
(f)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event, to the authority and power of the city council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(2)  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in F.S. ch. 175, to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including, but not limited to, common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than 25 percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
b.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
c.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and while any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
(3)  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. § 175.071, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(4)  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
(5)  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(6)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. All records maintained by the custodian of the fund shall indicate compliance with this subsection. 
(7)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalization, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(8)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(9)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform, either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(10)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled to shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(11)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(12)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided, further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(Code 1984, § 23-79; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-25, § 1, 6-23-2009) 
Sec. 44-167. - Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of 4.75 percent of his salary. Effective retroactively to the first paycheck in April 2009, each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of six percent of his salary. Members who retired on or after October 1, 2008, and who received a lump sum distribution for vacation and/or sick leave at retirement, shall pay the additional 1.25 percent employee contribution on any such distributions. Such contributions may be deducted from pension payments. The six percent employee contribution rate shall be set for three years. For the fiscal years beginning October 1, 2011 and October 1, 2014, there shall be an actuarial valuation to recalculate the cost of this benefit improvement. Up to 50 percent of the unallocated premium tax (state) funds shall be used to offset the employee's contribution and up to 50 percent of the unallocated premium tax (state) funds shall be used to offset the employer's contribution for this multiplier increase, by increasing the employee contribution and subsequently decreasing the employee contribution by the amount of funds necessary to offset the employer contribution. Effective for the first paycheck after April 1, 2015, each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of 7.5 percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. Each member electing to participate in the City of Melbourne Firefighters' Deferred Retirement Option Plan after October 10, 2017 shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of 6.5 percent of his salary. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(3)  Prior contributions. In addition to any amount contributed pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section, member contributions shall be considered to include amounts actually contributed by members prior to October 1, 1975, plus those assumed and deposited by the city on behalf of members since that date in the amount of five percent of earnings; however, no contributions shall be assumed to be made by the city on behalf of those who become members after May 9, 1978. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received by reason of laws of the state, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for firefighters of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five days after receipt by the city. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make contributions to the fund, at least quarterly, in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Code 1984, § 23-80; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 2, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2009-35, § 1, 10-13-2009; Ord. No. 2011-57, § 1, 12-13-2011; Ord. No. 2012-34, § 1, 8-28-2012; Ord. No. 2015-06, § 2, 3-24-2015; Ord. No. 2017-46, § 1, 10-10-2017) 
Sec. 44-168. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement date. 
(1)  For those who were members prior to May 9, 1978, the normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of the attainment of age 50, regardless of years of credited service, or the completion of 25 years of credited service, regardless of age. 
(2)  For those becoming members on or after May 9, 1978, the normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of the attainment of age 55 and the completion of ten years of credited service or the completion of 25 years of credited service, regardless of age. 
(3)  A member may retire on his normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter, and each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit on the member's normal retirement date. Normal retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the normal retirement date. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on his retirement date and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal 2.5 percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. For members retiring on or after October 1, 1995, the monthly retirement benefit shall equal three percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. For members employed prior to October 10, 2017 and retiring on or after October 1, 2008, the monthly retirement benefit shall equal 3.25 percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. For members employed on or after October 10, 2017 the monthly retirement benefit shall equal three percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the earlier of the attainment of age 50 or the completion of 20 years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a firefighter and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date, except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (d)(1) of this section, reduced by three percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a firefighter. 
(e)  Variable cost of living adjustment. There is hereby established an "enhanced benefit account" to provide for a lump sum variable cost of living adjustment for all retirees who retired, or members who will be retired under normal, early or disability retirement or those who became terminated vested on or after September 30, 1996, and their beneficiaries, in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Commencing on March 1, 1997, and each March 1 thereafter, the adjustment to the enhanced benefit account is determined to be the sum of: 
a.  Fifty percent of the amount by which the fund's net investment income (gross investment income less all costs associated with the investments) exceeds or falls short of the fund's investment return assumption for the preceding fiscal year (October 1 to September 30); and 
b.  Fifty percent of the amount by which the premium taxes collected and distributed by the state pursuant to section 54-92, as amended from time to time, exceeds 5.6 percent of covered payroll for the members during the preceding fiscal year. 
The investment return assumption and the percentage of covered payroll shall be known as the "benchmark rates." 
(2)  The calculation in subsection (e)(1) of this section shall be credited to or deducted from the enhanced benefit account as of April 1 each year and used to provide variable cost of living adjustment benefits to retirees as of April 1 each year, as follows: 
a.  Variable cost of living adjustment benefits are only payable to retirees retired as of the preceding September 30. 
b.  The variable cost of living adjustment benefits balance shall be allocated among the eligible retirees based upon: 
1.  The number of full months of retirement during the preceding fiscal year; and 
2.  In proportion to the amount of each retiree's actual monthly retirement benefit. 
c.  The variable cost of living adjustment benefit funds disbursed each year shall be limited to a maximum of three percent of the pension benefit per annum. In the event that in any year the balance in the fund would result in a higher payment, the excess shall be returned in the enhanced benefits account and carried forward to the next year. 
(3)  The amount of the variable cost of living adjustment benefit funds disbursed as provided for in subsection (e)(2) of this section shall be limited to the amount available in the enhanced benefit account. Effective retroactively to October 1, 2008, the enhanced benefit account shall be reduced by a one-time deduction representing a partial payment of the cost of the increase in the benefit accrual rate (to 3.25 percent) provided for in subsection (b) of this section. The one-time deduction shall be equal to the cost of the increase in the benefit accrual rate less the amount of any unallocated premium tax money which shall first be applied toward the cost of the past service credit. Prior to determining the amount to be distributed to retirees pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of this section, the enhanced benefit account shall be reduced by the amount necessary to provide the additional $2.50 supplemental benefit provided for in subsection (f) of this section. The cumulative value of the enhanced benefit account allocation provided by subsection (e)(1)a of this section shall not exceed the cumulative net actuarial gains and losses from all sources incurred from the inception of this provision. In the event any undisbursed funds remain in the enhanced benefit account after payment of the annual supplemental benefit, such excess shall be carried forward to the next year. Any funds carried forward in the enhanced benefit account shall be credited with investment earnings achieved by the pension fund attributable to said funds. Should insufficient funds be available in the enhanced benefit account to pay both the increased monthly supplemental benefit provided for in subsection (f) of this section ($2.50 for each full year of credited service) and the variable cost of living adjustment, then the increased monthly supplement shall be paid first and the funds remaining in the enhanced benefit account shall be used to provide the variable cost of living adjustment. 
(4)  The board is hereby delegated the authority to interpret and administer the provisions of this subsection (e) on variable cost of living. 
(f)  Supplemental benefit. Effective October 1, 2003, all current and future service retirees (including DROP participants once they begin to draw their monthly benefit), and disability retirees and all current and future vested terminated persons who begin receipt of benefits on or after that date, shall receive a monthly supplemental benefit equal to $5.00 for each full year of credited service, payable for the life of the retiree or terminated vested person and then terminating. Beginning on the date that is or would have been the fifth anniversary of the date that a retiree begins to or would have begun to receive retirement benefits, the monthly supplement amount will be increased to $7.50 for each full year of credited service. DROP participation shall count toward the satisfaction of the five-year requirement. This increase shall apply to all current and future retirees. Should insufficient funds be available in the enhanced benefit account to pay both the increased supplement and the variable cost of living adjustment, then the monthly supplement shall be paid first and the funds remaining in the enhanced benefit account shall be used to provide the variable cost of living adjustment on a pro rata basis. 
(g)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(h)  Share plan. In accordance with F.S. § 175.351(6), a defined contribution plan component ("share plan") is hereby established for firefighters as part of the defined benefit pension plan. The share plan will be funded exclusively with chapter 175 premium tax revenues pursuant to the following rules: In accordance with state law, the accumulated excess premium tax revenues as of October 1, 2015 ($258,620.00) shall be split 50/50, with 50 percent allocated to the share plan, and 50 percent used to pay down the unfunded liabilities of the defined benefit plan. For premium tax revenues received in any plan year after October 1, 2015, if the premium tax revenues exceed the amount collected in 2012 ($587,845.00), then the excess shall be split 50/50, with 50 percent allocated to the share plan and 50 percent used to reduce the city's annual required pension contributions to the defined benefit plan. The share plan will become operative when the city and the union reach agreement on the details of the share plan. The city agrees to transfer all premium tax distributions, regular and supplemental, to the pension fund within 30 days of receipt.

Sec. 44-169. - Pre-retirement death. 
(a)  Prior to eligibility for retirement. 
(1)  Service-connected. A death benefit shall be payable on behalf of any member who dies as a direct result of the performance of his duty as a firefighter, as follows: 
a.  To the spouse, until death, a monthly benefit equal to 40 percent of the member's regular base salary. 
b.  If there is no spouse, or upon the death of the spouse, for each unmarried child until he shall have reached the age of 18 years, or until age 22 years if a full-time student in a fully accredited high school, college, or university, there shall be paid in equal monthly installments an amount equal to 15 percent of the member's regular base salary. The non-student child's pension shall terminate on the earlier of death, marriage or the attainment of age 18 years. Legally adopted children shall be eligible the same as natural children. The maximum total amount payable to all such children shall be 40 percent of the member's regular base salary. The trusteeship and disbursements of the pension to any child or children shall be determined by the board. 
(2)  Nonservice-connected. The death benefit payable on behalf of a member becoming deceased, but not in the performance of duty, shall equal the member's accumulated contributions. 
(b)  Deceased employees eligible for retirement. For any deceased member who was eligible for early or normal retirement as of his date of death, the benefit payable shall be that with the greater actuarial value as between the benefit specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section, and the retirement benefit determined as though the deceased member had retired on his date of death, with the resulting amount then being payable to the beneficiary on a monthly basis for ten years, or on such other actuarially equivalent basis as approved by the board, so long as in accordance with section 44-178. 
(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, in the event a member or terminated vested person, with ten or more years of credited service, dies prior to retirement or prior to receipt of benefits, his beneficiary shall be entitled to the accrued normal or early retirement benefit payable at the deceased member's early or normal retirement age less the value of any benefits paid or payable under subsections (a) or (b) of this section. 
(d)  A beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection (a), (b) or (c) of this section, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(e)  Deceased members with spouse as beneficiary. Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (d) of this section when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary: 
(1)  Distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained 70.5. If the provisions of this subsection require that a benefit begin prior to a date provided for in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, the benefit shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the earlier date. 
(2)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under this section, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(f)  Deceased members with non-spouse beneficiary. Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (d) of this section, when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary: 
(1)  The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under this section, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of any remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
(3)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
(4)  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(Code 1984, § 23-82; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 4, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-170. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be the greater of 42 percent of the average final compensation and 40 percent of regular base salary of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(b)  In line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. To the extent required by state law, any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in subsection (b)(1) of this section shall apply only to those conditions described in subsection (b)(1) of this section that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
    Emergency rescue or public safety member means any member employed full-time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
    Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
    High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
1.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-healthcare setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
2.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
3.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
4.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint, when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
    Occupational exposure , in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death, shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
(i)  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
(ii)  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
(iii)  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States, or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
(iv)  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis, he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; pre-employment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a pre-employment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits no-in line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to the greater of two percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service and the accrued retirement benefit reduced as for early retirement with a further actuarial reduction in the event of disability prior to the early retirement date, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 25 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the city shall have terminated. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician and/or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(2)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be periodically re-examined by a qualified physician and/or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. 
(3)  In addition, the board shall annually, in October, require each disability retiree to submit to the board a notarized form to be provided by the board, indicating the retiree's continuing eligibility for disability benefits, including a doctor's statement if so required by the board. The retiree shall have 90 days to complete and return the form. 
(4)  In the event of recovery from disability as determined by the board and immediate reemployment by the city as a firefighter, the period of time while the retiree was disabled shall be included as continuous service. In the event of recovery, or the refusal by the retiree to submit to medical reexamination, but without immediate reemployment as a firefighter, the retiree's future benefits shall be determined as though he initially terminated employment on his date of disability. 
(5)  The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(6)  The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 44-172(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(Code 1984, § 23-83; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 5, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-171. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, determined as if he had remained employed, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, eligible for retirement. 
(Code 1984, § 23-84; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006) 
Sec. 44-172. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6.) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  For any member who does not participate in the DROP pursuant to section 44-187, a lump sum payment payable to the retiree of up to 20 percent of the present value of the retiree's accrued benefit at the date of retirement with the remaining value payable to the retiree in a form selected by the retiree and provided for in subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section or in the normal form (10-year certain and life). A retiree who is a participant in the deferred retirement option plan shall not be eligible to receive such lump sum payment. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) of this section) or beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries, where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree, and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 44-173. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 44-169. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 44-173. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 44-168(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary designated by the member in the amount computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board, in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Code 1984, § 23-85; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 6, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-173. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, or if the beneficiary named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Code 1984, § 23-86; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006) 
Sec. 44-174. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request, in writing, the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in state statutes.

Sec. 44-175. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year, on or before March 15, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 175.261. 
(Code 1984, § 23-88; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006) 
Sec. 44-176. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this article in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Code 1984, § 23-89; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006) 
Sec. 44-177. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in code section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in code section 415(b), and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, the "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for members employed on March 24, 2015, who have not reached the normal retirement date, and for members hired on or after March 24, 2015, the maximum pension benefit shall be $90,000.00 annually; provided, the $90,000.00 maximum annual benefit shall not apply to any member who is employed on the effective date of this ordinance, has not reached the normal retirement date, and has an accrued benefit on that date in excess of $90,000.00 annually, but such member shall not thereafter accrue any additional benefit. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the form of benefit without regard to any benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date is reduced to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of code section 415(b)(1). 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first calendar year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent calendar year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit, including any adjustment to the code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any calendar year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable treasury regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of code section 415(b), so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) of this section shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) of this section shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 44-170, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 44-169. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) of this section, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to section 44-170, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 44-169. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in code section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which the member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans; provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 44-188 and 44-189, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of code section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code section 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of code section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code section 415(c). 
c.  For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a of this section, the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under code section 415(b)(2)(c) solely by reason of this subsection c, and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b of this section. The system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection (1)c. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection (j), the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subsection (j)(2)b of this section, may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(3)  For purposes of applying the limits in this subsection (j), only, and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation, where applicable, will be compensation actually paid or made available during a calendar year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052, and will be determined without regard to any rules under code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2)). 
a.  However, for calendar years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under code section 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(b), 402(k), or 457(b). For calendar years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the calendar year will also include compensation paid by the later of 2.5 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the calendar year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in code section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under code sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (j)(4)a of this section will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by code section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(k)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost of living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is, in part or in whole, based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(Code 1984, § 23-90; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 7, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2015-06, § 4, 3-24-2015) 
Sec. 44-178. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2), elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. 
a.  If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70.5, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a.1, will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
b.  For purposes of this subsection (b)(2) and subsection (e) of this section, distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)a.4 of this section applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.1 of this section. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.1 of this section), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year, distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 44-168, 44-169, 44-171, or 44-172 (as applicable), and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 44-169) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of code section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in code section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I), or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Designated beneficiary means the individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the treasury regulations. 
    Distribution calendar year means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 44-169. 
(Code 1984, § 23-91; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 8, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-179. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system, with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city council which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(c)  Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the code for a qualified plan under code section 401(a) and a governmental plan under code section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Tax Laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions. 
(e)  Prohibited transactions. Effective as of January 1, 1989, a board may not engage in a transaction prohibited by code section 503(b). 
(f)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by code section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(g)  Vesting. 
(1)  Member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(2)  A member will be 100 percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)-21. 
(i)  Compliance with F.S. ch. 175. It is intended that the system will comply with the requirements of F.S. ch. 175 and continue to qualify for funding under F.S. § 175.101 
(Code 1984, § 23-92; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 9, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-180. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(c)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (c)(2) of this section involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the firefighter's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest, if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the firefighter. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c)(3) of this section, and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (c)(2) of this section, the amounts determined under subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section. 
(Code 1984, § 23-93; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 10, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2010-04, § 1, 1-26-2010) 
Sec. 44-181. - Domestic relations orders; retiree directed payments; exemption from execution, nonassignability. 
(a)  Domestic relations orders. 
(1)  Prior to the entry of any domestic relations order which affects or purports to affect the system's responsibility in connection with the payment of benefits of a retiree, the member or retiree shall submit the proposed order to the board for review to determine whether the system may legally honor the order. 
(2)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a beneficiary, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payments to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by F.S. ch. 175, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(c)  Exemption from execution, nonassignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accruing or accrued to any person under the provisions of this article, and the accumulated contributions and the cash securities in the fund created under this article, are hereby exempted from state, county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to garnishment, execution or attachment to any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable. 
(Code 1984, § 23-94; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 11, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2010-04, § 3, 1-26-2010) 
Sec. 44-182. - Pension validity. 
    The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension shall heretofore have been granted under any prior or existing law, or shall hereafter be granted or obtained erroneously, fraudulently or illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls or correct the pension amount of any person heretofore granted a pension under prior or existing law or any person hereafter granted a pension under this article if the same is found to be erroneous, fraudulent or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any person who has heretofore under any prior or existing law been or who shall hereafter under this article be erroneously, improperly or illegally classified. Any overpayments or underpayments shall be corrected and paid or repaid in a reasonable manner determined by the board. 
(Code 1984, § 23-95; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006) 
Sec. 44-183. - Forfeiture of pension. 
(a)  Any member who is convicted of the following offenses committed prior to retirement, or whose employment is terminated by reason of his admitted commission, aid or abatement of the following specified offenses, shall forfeit all rights and benefits under this system, except for the return of his accumulated contributions, but without interest, as of the date of termination.

Sec. 44-186. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  Generally. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Direct rollover means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
    Distributee means an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by code section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
    Eligible retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the code that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
    Eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in code section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in code section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, either to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Code 1984, § 23-99; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2009-17, § 13, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-187. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    DROP means the City of Melbourne Firefighters' Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
    DROP account means the account established for each DROP participant under subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a firefighter, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2) of this section, shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3) of this section; or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a firefighter. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection (b)(4)a.1 of this section, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2) of this section, including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses or interest, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section when he terminates his employment as a firefighter. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any additional benefits provided under any cost of living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in section 44-190. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a firefighter, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a firefighter. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a firefighter. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2) of this section, and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a firefighter and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b of this section. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a firefighter. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b of this section, a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be debited or credited after each fiscal year quarter with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of 6.5 percent per annum compounded monthly on the prior month's ending balance for members who enter the DROP before March 24, 2015, and 1.3 percent per annum compounded monthly on the prior month's ending balance for members who enter DROP on or after March 24, 2015; or 
2.  Earnings determined as follows: The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. The term "net investment return," for the purpose of this subsection, is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, management fees and transaction costs; or 
3.  Fifty percent of subsection (c)(2)b.1 of this section and 50 percent of subsection (c)(2)b.2 of this section. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive interest or earnings or both on his account in accordance with subsections (c)(2)b.1, 2 or 3 of this section. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election once each year during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of the quarter ending September 30 and shall be effective beginning October 1. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation date plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will be credited or debited with earnings or interest as provided for in subsection (d)(2) of this section. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the fire department. A member employed by the fire department after the permissible period of DROP participation will be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits and will accrue additional credited service only as provided for in section 44-190. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a firefighter. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5) of this section, no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a firefighter. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6) of this section. Elections under this subsection shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  In the alternative, the member may elect to receive, until the value of the member's DROP account is completely depleted, payments in approximately equal monthly or annual installments over a period, designated by the member, not to exceed the life expectancy of the last survivor of the member and his beneficiary. 
c.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. 
a.  Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
b.  Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, payments shall be made before the distribution date elected by the member to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of subsections (d)(4) and (d)(6) of this section. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 44-186. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP, and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form, such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the code, the applicable portions of the Act, and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including, but not limited to, determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP's assets. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(2)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(3)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(4)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(5)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(6)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(7)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the Laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(8)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(9)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

(4)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this subsection (b) for prior service with any other municipal, state, county or special district fire department in the state, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in section 44-177(k)(2). 
(5)  The maximum credit for purchases of credited service under this subsection (b) shall be five years. Credited service added pursuant to this subsection shall not count toward vesting, as provided for in section 44-171, or for eligibility for not in line of duty disability retirement, as provided for in section 44-170. 
(6)  For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a firefighter as provided for in this section, in addition to service as a firefighter in this state, credit may be purchased by the member in the same manner as provided above for federal, other state, county or municipal service if the prior service is recognized by the division of state fire marshal, as provided under F.S. ch. 633, or the firefighter provides proof to the board that such service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a firefighter under section 44-163. 
(c)  Payment option. In lieu of the lump sum payment provided for in subsection (a)(3) or (b)(3) of this section, a member may elect to make payments over a period of time in order to fully pay the amount provided for in subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section. The member shall be required to notify the board, in writing, of his election to make payments in the manner provided for in this subsection. The payment plan provided for in this subsection shall be subject to the following terms: 
(1)  The principal amount to be paid shall be determined as set forth in subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section. 
(2)  The original principal amount or any portion thereof shall be amortized over the period beginning with the first payment and ending no later than 60 months from the date of the first payment. 
(3)  Payments shall consist of principal and interest at a rate equal to the actuarially assumed rate of return on plan investments. 
(4)  Payments shall be made by payroll deduction from each paycheck on an after-tax basis. 
(5)  In the event that a member dies, retires (including entry into the deferred retirement option plan (DROP)) or otherwise terminates his employment, without having made full payment of the principal amount necessary to receive all credited service requested, the member shall receive so much of the credited service requested, determined using procedures established by the actuary, which could be purchased with the amount of principal paid by the member to the date of his death or termination of employment. 
(Code 1984, § 23-100.2; Ord. No. 2006-07, § 1, 1-24-2006; Ord. No. 2010-04, § 1-26-2010) 
Sec. 44-190. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a firefighter and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall, upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a firefighter, shall, upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city, in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (b) of this section and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. The term "normal retirement," as used in this subsection, shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(f)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment.

Sec. 44-219. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions, without interest. For purposes of determining refunds, accumulated contributions shall not include contributions made pursuant to former section 23-104(d). For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, determined on the basis of actuarial equivalency using assumptions adopted by the board such that benefit calculations are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means 1/12 of the average salary of the five best years of the last ten years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time police officer, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service. 
(1)  The term "credited service" means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions, if contributions were required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. In any event, credited service shall not include any period of service before October 1, 1975, during which the member failed to make contributions specified under the system as constituted before October 1, 1975, while eligible to do so. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a police officer with the police department within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment. 
(2)  The years or fractional parts of years that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353), after separation from employment as a police officer with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
a.  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
b.  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
c.  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this definition shall be five years. 
This definition is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this definition does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
(3)  In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
(4)  Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Effective date means the date on which this article becomes effective. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed police officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future, shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Police officer means an actively employed full-time person, employed by the city police department, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 943.1395. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry into the deferred retirement option plan. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a police officer, reportable on the member's W-2 form plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions excluding overtime hours worked in excess of 300 hours per year beginning October 1, 2008, and excluding any payments for extra duty or special detail work performed on behalf of a second party employer beginning May 2, 2011. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for members who are employed on November 27, 2012, salary shall exclude payments for overtime in excess of 200 hours per fiscal year; provided the 200-hour annual limit on overtime pay shall be increased to 300 hours in any fiscal year for overtime worked during any declared emergency. For members hired after November 27, 2012, salary shall exclude payments for overtime in excess of 150 hours per fiscal year, regardless of whether or not the overtime is worked during a declared emergency. Payments for extra duty or special detail work performed on behalf of a second party employer shall not be deemed overtime. For members who are employed on November 27, 2012, and members hired on or after that date, salary shall also exclude payments for accrued unused sick and annual leave, except that for members who are employed on November 27, 2012, salary shall include the lesser amount of either the accrued unused sick and annual leave on November 27, 2012, or the actual amount of accrued unused sick and annual leave for which the member receives payment, regardless of whether the amount of accrued sick and annual leave was, at some time prior to retirement, reduced below the amount of accrued unused sick and annual leave on November 27, 2012. Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in section 401(a)(17) of the code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 2, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost of living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for the prior period. The limitation on compensation for an eligible employee shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. An "eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Spouse means the lawful wife or husband of a member or retiree at the time benefits become payable.

Sec. 44-221. - Board of trustees. 
(a)  The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibility for the proper operation of the system and for making effective the provisions of this article is hereby vested in a board of trustees. The board is hereby designated as the plan administrator. The board shall consist of five trustees, two of whom, unless otherwise prohibited by law, shall be legal residents of the city, who shall be appointed by the city council, and two of whom shall be members of the system, who shall be elected by a majority of the police officers who are members of the system. The fifth trustee shall be chosen by a majority of the previous four trustees as provided for herein, and such person's name shall be submitted to the city council. The fifth member may be a city employee. Upon receipt of the fifth person's name, the city council shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the board of trustees as its fifth trustee. The fifth trustee shall have the same rights as each of the other four trustees appointed or elected as herein provided and shall serve a two-year term unless he sooner vacates the office. Each resident trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of two years, unless he sooner vacates the office or is sooner replaced by the city council, at whose pleasure he shall serve. Each member trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of two years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the city as a police officer or otherwise vacates his office as trustee, whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing trustee. Each trustee may succeed himself in office. DROP participants may not be elected as or vote for elected trustees. The board shall establish and administer the nominating and election procedures for each election. The board shall meet at least quarterly each year. The board shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature, and description. 
(b)  The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect a chair and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the board. The trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and per diem as provided by law. 
(c)  Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board. Three affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board. A trustee shall have the right to abstain from voting as the result of a conflict of interest provided that trustee complies with the provisions of F.S. § 112.3143. 
(d)  The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal, and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the system. The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the system shall be paid from the fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. In the event the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. 
(e)  The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
(1)  To construe the provisions of the system and determine all questions arising thereunder. 
(2)  To determine all questions relating to eligibility and membership.

(Code 1984, § 23-103; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, § 2, 2-8-2000; Ord. No. 2006-14, § 2, 2-28-2006) 
Sec. 44-222. - Finances and fund management; establishment and operation of fund. 
(a)  As part of the system, there exists the fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system. 
(b)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(c)  All funds of the police officers' retirement system may be deposited by the board with the director of finance of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the director of finance of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the director of finance or clearly identified as such funds of the police officers' retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the police officers' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(d)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(1)  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis; 
(2)  Receipts and disbursements; 
(3)  Benefit payments; 
(4)  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city; 
(5)  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever; and 
(6)  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(e)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
(f)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event, to the authority and power of the city council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(2)  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in F.S. ch. 185 to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including, but not limited to, common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than 25 percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
b.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
c.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100 and Revenue Ruling 2011-1, or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or 457(g)(3) of the code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
(3)  The board shall not invest more than five percent at cost of its assets in the common stock, capital stock, or convertible securities of any one issuing company; nor shall the aggregate investment in any one issuing company exceed five percent of the outstanding capital stock of that company; nor shall the aggregate of its investments in common stock, capital stock and convertible securities at market exceed 70 percent of the assets of the fund. The board may invest in real estate, provided the board shall not invest more than five percent at cost in real property or real estate. 
(4)  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. § 185.06, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(5)  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
(6)  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(7)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(8)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(9)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(10)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform, either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(11)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(12)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(13)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(14)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided, further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(Code 1984, § 23-104; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 98-63, §§ 1, 2, 12-8-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, § 3, 2-8-2000; Ord. No. 2003-54, § 2, 8-26-2003; Ord. No. 2010-05, § 2, 1-26-2010; Ord. No. 2013-46, § 2(23-104), 8-13-2013) 
Sec. 44-223. - Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of five percent of his salary. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, effective September 1, 2013, each member employed on November 27, 2012, shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of 6.5 percent of the member's salary. Each member hired after November 27, 2012, shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of eight percent of the member's salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the state, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police officers of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five days after receipt by the city. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the amount required by the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Code 1984, § 23-105; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, § 4, 2-8-2000; Ord. No. 2009-118, § 2, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2012-43, § 2(23-105), 11-27-2012) 
Sec. 44-224. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement date. 
(1)  For those who became members of the system on or prior to January 1, 1980, the normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of the attainment of age 50 and the completion of ten years of credited service or completion of 25 years of credited service, regardless of age. 
(2)  For those who became members of the system after January 1, 1980, the normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of the attainment of age 55 and the completion of ten years of credited service or completion of 25 years of credited service, regardless of age. 
(3)  A member may retire on his normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter, and each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit on the member's normal retirement date. Normal retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the normal retirement date. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal three percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. 
(1)  A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be: 
a.  For those who became members of the system on or prior to January 1, 1980, the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age 40 and the completion of ten years of credited service. 
b.  For those who become members of the system after January 1, 1980, the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age 45 and the completion of ten years of credited service. 
(2)  Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a police officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (d)(1) of this section, which is reduced by three percent for each of the first five years and actuarially reduced for all years in excess of five years from the amount to which he would have been entitled had he retired on the date which would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a police officer and with the same number of years of credited service as at the time his benefits commence and based on his average final compensation at that date. 
(e)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  Cost of living adjustment. 
(1)  There shall be paid to all eligible members retiring on or after October 1, 2008, a one percent annual cost of living adjustment (COLA). Eligible members include service retirements, disability retirements, and members who enter the DROP. This COLA shall not apply to terminated vested members. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (f)(1) of this section, for members who are employed and have not reached the normal retirement date on November 27, 2012, there shall be a proportional cost of living adjustment applied to benefits based on the member's credited service as of November 27, 2012 (for example, if a member has 20 years of credited service as of November 27, 2012, and retires upon reaching 25 years of credited service, then the COLA would be 20/25 of 1.0 percent or 0.8 percent). For members who are employed and have not reached the normal retirement date on November 27, 2012, the cost of living adjustment shall be applied one year after the date of normal retirement and continue for ten years after retirement. For members who are hired after November 27, 2012, there shall be no cost of living adjustment. 
(g)  Intent of Ordinance. It is the intent of Ord. No. 2009-49 that no additional employee contributions be required to fund this COLA benefit. The members, in accordance with F.S. § 185.35, have approved the use of the maximum available insurance premium tax income to offset the city contribution to a maximum of $752,912.00. 
(Code 1984, § 23-106; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2006-122, § 1, 12-19-2006; Ord. No. 2009-118, § 3, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2009-49, §§ 2, 3, 1-12-2010; Ord. No. 2012-43, § 3(23-106), 11-27-2012) 
Sec. 44-225. - Pre-retirement death. 
(a)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of 100 percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(b)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection (b) applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary may receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary may receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit. 
(4)  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained 70.5. 
(6)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however, the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to section 44-228(g). 
(4)  A beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
(6)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
(7)  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(d)  Death benefit. In lieu of the benefit provided for in subsection (b) or (c) of this section, a beneficiary may elect to receive a death benefit of $50,000.00. The board may secure a group life insurance policy to fund this benefit, or, in lieu thereof, may elect that this benefit be funded through a self-insurance program administered by the board. 
(Code 1984, § 23-107; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, § 5, 2-8-2000; Ord. No. 2009-118, § 4, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-226. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in line of duty. 
(1)  Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 50 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(2)  Any presumption with respect to in line of duty disability provided for in F.S. ch. 112 or 185, as amended from time to time, is hereby incorporated herein by reference. 
(b)  Disability benefits not in line of duty. Any member with 366 consecutive days of credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but, in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 25 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(c)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a police officer with the city shall have terminated. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(d)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician and/or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician and/or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his disability pension. 
(2)  The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. If the retiree recovers from disability and re-enters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he re-entered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(e)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 44-228(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(Code 1984, § 23-108; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, § 6, 2-8-2000; Ord. No. 2002-84, § 2, 12-17-2002; Ord. No. 2009-118, § 5, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-227. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(Code 1984, § 23-109; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, § 7, 2-8-2000; Ord. No. 2006-14, § 3, 2-28-2006) 
Sec. 44-228. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6.) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) of this section) or beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree, and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 44-229. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 44-225. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 44-229. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 44-224(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement, and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary designated by the member in the amount computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board, in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Code 1984, § 23-110; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, § 8, 2-8-2000; Ord. No. 2002-84, § 3, 12-17-2002; Ord. No. 2006-14, § 4, 2-28-2006; Ord. No. 2009-118, § 6, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-229. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section or if the beneficiary named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Code 1984, § 23-111; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, § 9, 2-8-2000)

(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures.

Sec. 44-233. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in code section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in code section 415(b), and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. In addition to the foregoing limitation, members who are employed and have not reached the normal retirement date as of November 27, 2012, and members hired on or after that date, shall not receive an annual benefit (including COLA) that exceeds $90,000.00. For purposes of this section, a "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(2)  For purposes of code section 415(b), the term "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to code section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in code section 415(b)(2)(A)). The benefit attributable shall be determined in accordance with treasury regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a) of this section, then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in treasury regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62); and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the section 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of code section 415(b)(1). 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect. 
(1)  Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
a.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
b.  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
c.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
(2)  Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable treasury regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of code section 415(b) of the code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62 years. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) of this section shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) of this section shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 44-226, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 44-225. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) of this section, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten years of participation or service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 44-226, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 44-225. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in code section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans; provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 44-244 and 44-245, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of code section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code section 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of code section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a of this section, the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under code section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection (j), and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b of this section. The system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection (j), the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subsection (j)(2)b of this section, may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the code section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation, where applicable, will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052, and will be determined without regard to any rules under code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2)). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under code section 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 2.5 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in code section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under code section 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a of this section will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by code section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under section 415(c) of the code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the employee plans compliance resolution system (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under section 401(a)(17) of the code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost of living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is, in part or in whole, based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(Code 1984, § 23-115; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 98-63, § 3, 12-8-1998; Ord. No. 2000-17, §§ 12, 13, 2-8-2000; Ord. No. 2002-84, § 4, 12-17-2002; Ord. No. 2009-118, § 7, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2012-43, § 4(23-115), 11-27-2012; Ord. No. 2013-46, § 3(23-115), 8-13-2013) 
Sec. 44-234. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2), elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. 
a.  If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70.5, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a.1, will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
b.  For purposes of this subsection (b)(2) and subsection (e) of this section, distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)a.4 of this section applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.1 of this section. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.1 of this section), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year, distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 44-224, 44-226, 44-227, or 44-228 (as applicable), and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 44-225) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received (e.g., monthly). All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue code section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue code section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I), or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Designated beneficiary means the individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations. 
    Distribution calendar year means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 44-225.

Sec. 44-235. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system, with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city council which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(c)  Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the code for a qualified plan under code section 401(a) and a governmental plan under code section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Tax Laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions. 
(e)  Prohibited transactions. Effective as of January 1, 1989, a board may not engage in a transaction prohibited by Internal Revenue Code Section 503(b). 
(f)  USERRA.

(1)  Member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(2)  A member will be 100 percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Internal Revenue Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board.

Sec. 44-236. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  The ordinance establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(c)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (c)(2) of this section involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the police officer's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest, if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the police officer. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c)(3) of this section, and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (c)(2) of this section, the amounts determined under subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

Sec. 44-242. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  Generally. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Distributee means an employee or former employee. It ALSO includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
    Direct rollover means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan. 
    Eligible retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the code that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. 
    Eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in code section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in code section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

(5)  Credited service purchased pursuant to this section shall not count for vesting, as provided for in section 44-227, or for eligibility for not in line of duty disability benefits as provided for in section 44-226. 
(6)  In lieu of the lump sum payment provided for above, a member may elect to make payments over a period of time in order to fully pay the amount provided for in subsection (1) of this section.

(Code 1984, § 23-126; Ord. No. 98-32, § 1, 8-11-1998; Ord. No. 2002-84, § 6, 12-17-2002; Ord. No. 2010-05, § 4, 1-26-2010) 
Sec. 44-245. - Prior police service. 
(a)  Prior city service. The years and fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a police officer with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or for which he is not otherwise receiving credited service, shall be added to his years of credited service provided that:

Interest at an effective rate of 6.5 percent per annum compounded monthly on the prior month's ending balance for members who enter the DROP before November 27, 2012, and 1.3 percent per annum compounded monthly on the prior month's ending balance for members who enter the DROP on or after November 27, 2012; 
2.  Earnings determined as follows: The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. The term "net investment return," for the purpose of this subsection, is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees; or 
3.  Fifty percent of subsection (c)(2)b.1 of this section and 50 percent of subsection (c)(2)b.2 of this section. Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive interest or earnings or both on his account in accordance with subsection (c)(2)b.1, 2, or 3 of this section. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation date plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed as a police officer by the police department. A member employed as a police officer by the police department after the permissible period of DROP participation will be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits and will accrue additional credited service only as provided for in section 44-247. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5) of this section, no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6) of this section. Elections under this subsection shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. 
a.  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
b.  In lieu of a distribution as described in subsection (d)(3)a of this section, a member may, in accordance with such procedures as the board shall prescribe, elect to have the distribution of his DROP account made as of the first day of any month coincident with or following his termination of employment as a police officer; provided, however, payments shall be made before the distribution date elected by the member to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of subsections (d)(5) of this section. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 44-242. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP, and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare and distribute to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including, but not limited to, determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP, and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(2)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(3)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(4)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects, and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(5)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(6)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(7)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of the state, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(8)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(9)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(Code 1984, § 23-128; Ord. No. 2000-22, § 1, 3-28-2000; Ord. No. 2002-84, § 8, 12-17-2002; Ord. No. 2006-14, § 8, 2-28-2006; Ord. No. 2009-118, § 14, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2010-05, § 6, 1-6-2010; Ord. No. 2012-43, § 5(23-128), 11-27-2012) 
Sec. 44-247. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall, upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a police officer shall, upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system, and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (b) of this section and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. The term "normal retirement," as used in this subsection, shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(f)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment.

This definition is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this definition does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
(3)  In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed.

However, any funds so deposited with the director of finance of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the director of finance or clearly identified as such funds of the general employees' pension plan. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the general employees' pension plan in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(d)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(1)  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis; 
(2)  Receipts and disbursements; 
(3)  Benefit payments; 
(4)  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city; 
(5)  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever; and 
(6)  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(e)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(f)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event, to the authority and power of the city council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(2)  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in the state statutes to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property, wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including but, not limited to, common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. 
b.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
c.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements, of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100 and Revenue Ruling 2011-1 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the code, and governmental plans under section 401(a)(24) of the code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
(3)  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(4)  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
(5)  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(6)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(7)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(8)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(9)  Where any action which the board is required to take, or any duty or function which it is required to perform, either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(10)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled to, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(11)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits herein provided for. 
(12)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(13)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents; provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided, further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(14)  The board shall not invest more than ten percent at cost of its assets in real property or real estate and there shall be no investment in a limited partnership or trust. 
(Code 1984, § 23-143; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2007-62, § 2, 7-24-2007; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2013-45, § 2(23-143), 8-13-2013) 
Sec. 44-277. - Contributions. 
(a)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make at least quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(b)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Code 1984, § 23-144; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-278. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement date. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of the attainment of age 62 and the completion of six years of credited service or the completion of 30 years of credited service, regardless of age, for general employees, and for airport security officers, upon the attainment of age 55 and the completion of six years of credited service or the completion of 25 years of credited service, regardless of age, and for the city manager, the attainment of age 57 and the completion of ten years of credited service. A member may retire on his normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter, and each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit on the member's normal retirement date. Normal retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the normal retirement date. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. 
(1)  An ASO member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during the member's lifetime and ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal three percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service. 
(2)  A general employee member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during the member's lifetime and ceasing upon death. The monthly retirement benefit shall equal 1.6 percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service; provided, however, if the member has completed more than 30 years of credited service or is older than age 62 at the time of retirement, the applicable benefit rate for all years of credited service shall be as follows: 
Age 63 or 31 years of credited service 1.63% Age 64 or 32 years of credited service 1.65% At or over age 65 or 33 or more years of credited service 1.68%  
Provided, further, however, that the benefit rate shall be two percent for each year or fractional part of a year that a general employee member is employed as a senior management employee. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the completion of six years of credited service, regardless of age. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a general employee or airport security officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. For general employees, the benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (a) of this section, reduced by 5/12 of one percent for each month by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a general employee. For ASOs, the benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (a) of this section, reduced by one-fourth of one percent for each month for each of the first five years by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as an airport security officer and 5/12 of one percent for each additional month by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as an airport security officer. 
(e)  Supplemental benefit. In addition to the benefits provided for under normal retirement in subsection (b) if this section and early retirement in subsection (d) of this section, each retiree or beneficiary of a deceased retiree shall receive an additional supplemental monthly benefit equal to $5.00 times the retiree's years of credited service at retirement; provided, however, that the supplemental benefit shall be at least $30.00 and not more than $150.00 per month. Disability retirees and terminated vested persons shall not be eligible for this supplemental benefit and the benefits shall not be increased by the cost of living adjustments provided for in subsection (f) of this section. 
(f)  Cost of living adjustments. 
(1)  Each July 1 following the commencement of monthly benefit payments, retired general employees and beneficiaries of deceased general employees who are receiving monthly benefit payments shall receive a three percent increase in their monthly benefit amount. 
(2)  Beginning on the July 1 following the completion of two years of monthly benefit payments and on each July 1 thereafter, retired airport security officers who are receiving monthly benefit payments shall receive a three percent increase in their monthly benefit amount. 
(g)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(Code 1984, § 23-145; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2004-83, § 1, 11-9-2004; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2011-12, § 1, 3-22-2011) 
Sec. 44-279. - Pre-retirement death. 
(a)  Prior to vesting. The beneficiary of a member who dies prior to the completion of six years of credited service shall receive a refund of 100 percent of the member's accumulated contributions, if any. 
(b)  Vested deceased members. In the event that a member dies following the completion of six years of credited service, the member's beneficiary shall elect to receive either a deferred annuity payable on the date the deceased member would have attained age 62 for a general employee or on the date the deceased member would have attained age 55 for an airport security officer, or an immediate benefit reduced in the same manner as for early retirement, which benefits shall be computed based upon the assumption that the member had retired on the date of death and had elected the 100 percent joint and survivor optional form of benefit. 
(c)  Deceased members with spouse as beneficiary. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary: 
(1)  Distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained 70.5. If the provisions of this subsection require that a benefit begin prior to a date provided for in subsection (b) of this section, the benefit shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the earlier date. 
(2)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under this section, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(d)  Deceased members with non-spouse beneficiary. Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary: 
(1)  The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under this section, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of any remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
(3)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
(4)  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(Code 1984, § 23-146; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-280. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in line of duty. 
(1)  Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a general employee, if the member is a general employee, or as an airport security officer, if the member is an airport security officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a general employee or airport security officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to: 
a.  For general employees, a monthly pension equal to 1.6 percent (or two percent for years or fractional parts of years as a senior management employee) of his average final compensation multiplied by his years of credited service, but, in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of his average final compensation. 
b.  For airport security officers, a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by his years of credited service, but, in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of his average final compensation. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the event an airport security officer member is determined by the board to be disabled in line of duty and the member is unable to render useful and efficient service as an officer or employee of the city and unable to perform another type of work, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 65 percent of the average final compensation of the member. 
(2)  Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(b)  Disability benefits not in line of duty. 
(1)  Any member with eight years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a general employee, if the member is a general employee, or as an airport security officer, if the member is an airport security officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a general employee or airport security officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to: 
a.  For general employees, a monthly pension equal to 1.6 percent (or two percent for years or fractional parts of years as a senior management employee) of his average final compensation multiplied by his years of credited service, but, in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 25 percent of his average final compensation. 
b.  For airport security officers, a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by his years of credited service. 
(2)  Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits, except that those terminated by the city for medical reasons may apply for a disability within 30 days after termination. 
(c)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or alcohol. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a general employee or airport security officer with the city shall have terminated. 
(6)  Willful, wanton or intentional misconduct or gross negligence of the member. 
(7)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(8)  A condition pre-existing the general employee's or airport security officer's membership in the system. No member shall be entitled to a disability pension, whether in line of duty or not in line of duty, because of or due to the aggravation of a specific injury, impairment or other medical condition pre-existing at the time of membership in the system, provided that such pre-existing condition and its relationship to a later injury, impairment or other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a disability pension to a member who, after membership in the system, suffers an injury, impairment or other medical condition different from some other injury, impairment, or other medical condition existing at or prior to said membership. 
(d)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician and/or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(2)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this system may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician and/or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a general employee or airport security officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a general employee or airport security officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
(3)  The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(4)  If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a general employee or airport security officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(e)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or, for ASO members, the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 44-282(a)(1), (2), or (3), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(f)  Workers' compensation. When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440 or social security disability benefits, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from each when combined exceeds 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed 100 percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Social security disability cost of living increases shall not be used to further offset disability benefits. 
(Code 1984, § 23-147; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-281. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a general employee or airport security officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than six years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions, if any, or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has six or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing immediately (reduced as for early retirement) or at the member's otherwise normal retirement date, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions, if any, and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions, if any, and does not survive to his otherwise normal retirement date, benefits are payable as provided for in section 44-279. 
(Code 1984, § 23-148; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-282. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  For general employee members, a retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the member for his lifetime only, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. 
(2)  For ASO members, a retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the member for his lifetime only, ceasing upon death. 
(3)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the member during the lifetime of the member and following the death of the member, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for the joint pensioner's lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6.) 
(4)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system and approved by the board, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) of this section) or beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries, where applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary, and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time. The member may only change his joint pensioner if the designated joint pensioner and the member were married at the time of member's retirement and are divorced subsequent thereto, and the joint pensioner is alive at the time of the change. In no event may a member change his designated joint pensioner more than twice. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon the change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially determined to take into account the age and sex of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner, and the retiree. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 44-279. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 44-279. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 44-279. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 44-279(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary designated by the member in the amount computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board, in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member. The determination to make such payment shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death.

Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, or if the beneficiary named by a deceased member or retiree predeceased the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Code 1984, § 23-150; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009)

Sec. 44-285. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this system in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid.

(Code 1984, § 23-152; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-286. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in code section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in code section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, a "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(2)  For purposes of code section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to code section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in code section 415(b)(2)(A))). The benefit attributable shall be determined in accordance with treasury regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a) of this section, then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in treasury regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62); and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and: 
1.  For years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent revenue ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and 
2.  For years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the section 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of code section 415(b)(1). 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect. 
(1)  Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
a.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
b.  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit, including any adjustment to the code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
c.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
(2)  Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable treasury regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of code section 415(b), so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62 years. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) of this section shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) of this section shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 44-280, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 44-279. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) of this section, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65 years. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten years of participation or service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 44-280, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 44-279. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in code section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which the member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans; provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 44-296 and 44-298, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of code section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code section 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of code section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a of this section, the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under code section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b of this section. The system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection (j). 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection (j) the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subsection (j)(2)b of this section, may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the code section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only, and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052, and will be determined without regard to any rules under code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2)). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under code section 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 2.5 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in code section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under code section 415(c) or (n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a of this section will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by code section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under section 415(c) of the code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under section 401(a)(17) of the code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost of living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is, in part or in whole, based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(Code 1984, § 23-153; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2003-55, § 3, 8-26-2003; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009; Ord. No. 2013-45, § 3(23-153), 8-13-2013) 
Sec. 44-287. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2), elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70.5 years or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. 
a.  If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70.5 years, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
b.  For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)a.4 of this section applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.1 of this section. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.1 of this section), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 44-278, 44-279, 44-281, or 44-282 (as applicable), and, in any event, over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 44-279) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I), or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Designated beneficiary means the individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 40l(a)(9) of the code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations. 
    Distribution calendar year means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date.

Sec. 44-288. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city council which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(c)  Qualification of system. It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the code for a qualified plan under code section 401(a) and a governmental plan under code section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Tax Laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions.

(f)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Internal Revenue Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(g)  Vesting. 
(1)  A member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(2)  A member will be 100 percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Internal Revenue Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations section 1.401(a)-21.

(a)  Ordinance No. 95-61, establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if Ordinance No. 95-61, or any subsequent ordinance, shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby, except to the extent that the assets of the fund may be determined to be inadequate. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this system who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, or if contributions to the system are discontinued, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal, and the assets of the system shall be allocated in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons so entitled in accordance with the provisions thereof. 
(c)  The following shall be the order of priority for purposes of allocating the assets of the system as of the date of repeal of this article, or if contributions to the system are discontinued with, the date of such discontinuation being determined by the board. 
(1)  Apportionment shall first be made in respect of each retiree receiving a retirement or disability benefit hereunder on such date, each person receiving a benefit on such date on account of a retired or disabled (but since deceased) member, and each member who has, by such date, become eligible for normal retirement but has not yet retired, an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of such benefit; provided that, if such asset value be less than the aggregate of such amounts, such amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such asset value. 
(2)  If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionment under subsection (c)(1) of this section, apportionment shall next be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such date who is vested and who is not entitled to an apportionment under subsection (c)(1) of this section, in the amount required to provide the actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions, if any), based on the credited service and average final compensation as of such date, and each vested former member then entitled to a deferred benefit who has not, by such date, begun receiving benefit payments in the amount required to provide said actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions, if any) provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such latter amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(3)  If there is any asset value after the apportionments under subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section, apportionment shall be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such date who is not entitled to an apportionment under subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section in the amount equal to member's accumulated contributions, provided that, if such remaining asset value is less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such latter amount shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(4)  If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionments under subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, apportionment shall lastly be made in respect of each member included in subsection (c)(3) of this section, to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of the non-vested accrued normal retirement benefit (less the amount apportioned in subsection (c)(3) of this section), based on the credited service and average final compensation as of such date; provided that, if such remaining asset value be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such amounts shall be reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(5)  In the event that there is asset value remaining after the full apportionment specified in subsections (c)(1)-(4) of this section, such excess shall be returned to the city's general fund. 
The allocation of the fund provided for in this subsection (c) may, as decided by the board, be carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits determined in accordance with this subsection (c). The fund may be distributed in one sum to the persons entitled to said benefits or the distribution may be carried out in such other equitable manner as the board may direct. The fund may be continued in existence for purposes of subsequent distributions. 
(d)  After all the vested and accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid and after all other liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund of the city. 
(Code 1984, § 23-156; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009)

(1)  Prior to the entry of any domestic relations order which affects or purports to affect the system's responsibility in connection with the payment of benefits of a retiree, the member or retiree shall submit the proposed order to the board for review to determine whether the system may legally honor the order. 
(2)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(b)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(c)  Exemption from execution, nonassignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this article and the accumulated contributions, if any, and the cash securities in the fund created under this article are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable.

Sec. 44-294. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  Generally. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Distributee means an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
    Direct rollover means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
    Eligible retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
    Eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in code section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in code section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in code section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Code 1984, § 23-161; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2003-55, § 4, 8-26-2003; Ord. No. 2006-73, § 5, 7-11-2006; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-295. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    DROP means the City of Melbourne General Employees' Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
    DROP account means the account established for each DROP participant under subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a general employee or airport security officer, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP, provided that the election to participate in the DROP is made within 12 months following the date on which the member first becomes eligible for normal retirement, or, for a member who first reached eligibility for normal retirement prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, the election to participate is made within 12 months from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. A member who fails to make the election within such 12-month limitation period shall forfeit all rights to participate in the DROP. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2) of this section, shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time that the member first becomes eligible for normal retirement. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than 60 months after commencement of DROP participation. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3) of this section; or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a general employee or airport security officer. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection (b)(4)a.1 of this section, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2) of this section, including monthly benefits and interest, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section when he terminates his employment as general employee or airport security officer. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any additional benefits provided under any cost of living adjustment in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a general employee or airport security officer, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a general employee or airport security officer. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a general employee or airport security officer. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2) of this section, and interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a general employee or airport security officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b of this section. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a general employee or airport security officer. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b of this section, a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be credited at the end of each calendar month with interest at an effective rate of 6.5 percent per annum compounded monthly for members who enter the DROP before June 1, 2012; and at a rate of 1.3 percent per annum compounded monthly for members who enter the DROP on or after June 1, 2012. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited with interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation. If a member is employed by the city after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then, beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited with interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the city. A member employed by the city after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits, nor will he accrue additional credited service. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a general employee or airport security officer. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5) of this section, no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a general employee or airport security officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6) of this section. A member may, however, elect, in such time and manner as the board shall prescribe, that his DROP distribution be used to purchase a nonforfeitable fixed annuity payable in such form as the member may elect. Elections under this subsection shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form, provided for in the preceding subsection, as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 44-294. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form, such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the code, the applicable portions of the Act and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board, from time to time, shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including, but not limited to, determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP's assets. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(2)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(3)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(4)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(5)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from the time and manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(6)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(7)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of the state, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(8)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(9)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

Sec. 44-298. - Prior public service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the years and fractional parts of years that a member was previously employed as a permanent full-time or permanent part-time general employee with the city, and who is not otherwise entitled to credited service for such previous period of employment as a general employee, or the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a full-time employee for any governmental agency in the United States, including, but not limited to, federal, state, county or local government service, and for which he does not otherwise qualify for and receive credit under this system, shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund an actuarially determined amount so that the crediting of the purchased service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section for service other than with the city shall be ten years of credited service and shall count for all purposes, including vesting, but not including eligibility for not in line of duty disability benefits. There shall be no maximum credit for purchase of prior service with the city and such service shall count for all purposes, including vesting and eligibility for not in line of duty disability benefits. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other governmental agency or public employer, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in section 44-286(i)(2). 
(6)  In lieu of the lump sum payment provided for above, a member may elect to make payments over a period of time in order to fully pay the amount provided for in subsection (1) of this section. The member shall be required to notify the board, in writing, of his election to make payments in the manner provided for in this subsection. The payment plan provided for in this subsection shall be subject to the following terms: 
a.  The principal amount to be paid shall be determined as set forth in subsection (1) of this section. 
b.  The original principal amount or any portion thereof shall be amortized over the period beginning with the first payment and ending no later than 60 months from the date of the first payment.

(Code 1984, § 23-166; Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 6-11-2002; Ord. No. 2006-73, § 7, 7-11-2006; Ord. No. 2009-19, § 1, 5-12-2009) 
Sec. 44-299. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Generally. Any retiree who is retired under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city in any capacity shall, upon being reemployed at least 12 months after the retiree's retirement date, continue receipt of retirement benefits during any such employment period. A retiree who returns to work under the provisions of this section and, by virtue of that reemployment, would be eligible to participate in this system, shall not accumulate additional credited service for subsequent periods of employment described in this section and shall not be eligible for any other benefit other than the retiree's normal retirement benefit. Regardless of any other provision of this system, any retired and reemployed retiree continuing to receive retirement benefits shall not be an active member of the system. Retirees who are reemployed as described in this subsection, but who have been retired for less than 12 months, shall have their retirement benefit suspended until the date that the retiree would have been retired for 12 months had he not been reemployed. 
(c)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system until the earlier of (1) or (2), where (1) is his termination of employment and (2) is the later of the date that the reemployed retiree reaches the date that is 12 months after his retirement or the date he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. The term "normal retirement," as used in this subsection, shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. A retiree who returns to work under the provisions of this section shall not be eligible for membership in the system, and, therefore, shall not accumulate additional credited service for subsequent periods of employment described in this section, and shall not be eligible for any other benefit other than the retiree's early retirement benefit when he again becomes eligible as provided herein. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(d)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(e)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall have the options provided for in this section for reemployment upon termination of employment.

ARTICLE III. - PANHANDLING AND BEGGING 

Sec. 46-50. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose and intent of this article is to recognize the constitutional right of persons to beg and panhandle in a peaceful and non-threatening manner; however, an increase in aggressive panhandling and begging throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses, and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. Aggressive panhandling and begging usually include approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive requests for donations of money despite refusals, the use of abusive or profane language, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Additionally, the presence of panhandlers and beggars who request money from persons in specific public areas such as bus stops, automated teller machines, public transit vehicles, including buses and trolleys, and while standing in line to enter an event or a building, is especially troublesome because persons being solicited by such panhandlers and beggars cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct, which often carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property. 
(b)  This article is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to beg, panhandle or solicit funds, picket, protest, or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity, when conducted in a legal manner. The goal of this article is instead to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of panhandling and begging that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city by prohibiting aggressive panhandling and begging throughout the city and by prohibiting panhandling and begging in certain public places, based upon significant governmental interests. The restrictions contained in this article are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest, and preserve ample alternative areas for the valid exercise of constitutional rights. 
(Ord. No. 2014-40, § 2(26-10), 7-8-2014) 
Sec. 46-51. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Aggressive panhandling or begging means: 
(1)  To approach or speak to a person and demand, request or beg for money or a donation of valuable property in such a manner as would cause a reasonable person to believe that the person is being threatened with imminent bodily injury or the commission of a criminal act upon the person approached or another person in the solicited person's company, or upon property in the person's immediate possession (for example, placing oneself within two feet of a solicited person and/or using abusive or profane language in a loud voice while demanding or requesting money); 
(2)  To maintain contact with a solicited person and continue demanding, requesting or begging for money or a donation of valuable property after the solicited person has made a negative response to an initial demand or request for money or a donation (for example, walking in front of, next to, or behind a solicited person while continuing to demand, request or beg for money from that person after that person has refused to donate or give money); 
(3)  To obstruct, block or impede, either individually or as part of a group of persons, the passage or free movement of a solicited person or a person in the company of a solicited person, including persons on foot, on bicycles, in wheelchairs or operating motor vehicles, or persons attempting to enter or exit motor vehicles (for example, walking, standing, sitting, laying, or placing an object in such a manner as to block passage of another person or vehicle, or to require another person or driver of a vehicle to take evasive action to avoid physical contact); 
(4)  To touch a solicited person or a person in the company of a solicited person, or to touch any vehicle occupied by a solicited person or by a person in the company of the solicited person, without the person's express consent; 
(5)  To engage in conduct that would reasonably be construed as intended to intimidate, compel or force a solicited person to accede to demands; or 
(6)  To step upon or to stand in the portion of a roadway paved for vehicular traffic for the purpose of soliciting a donation or accepting a donation from any occupant of any vehicle on the roadway. 
    Panhandle or beg means any demand or request made in person for an immediate donation of money or some other article of value from another person for the use of one's self or others. As used in this article, the term "solicit," and its forms, is included in this definition. Any purchase of an item for an amount far exceeding its value, under circumstances where a reasonable person would understand that the purchase is in substance a donation, constitutes a donation as contemplated in this definition. The term "panhandling" or "begging" does not include the act of passively standing or sitting, performing music, or singing without a sign or other indication that a donation is being sought, and without any vocal or verbal request other than a response to an inquiry by another person. 
    Solicit, as used in this article, has the same meaning as panhandle or beg.

Sec. 46-52. - Panhandling and begging regulations and prohibitions. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person within the city to: 
(1)  Engage in the act of aggressive panhandling or begging in any location in the city. 
(2)  Approach any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle for the purpose of panhandling or begging, or offering to perform a service in connection with such vehicle, or otherwise offer for sale any goods or services, if such panhandling, begging or offer of goods and services is done in an aggressive manner. 
(3)  Engage in the act of panhandling or begging when the panhandler, beggar, or person being solicited by a panhandler or beggar is located in, on, or at any of the prohibited areas for panhandling and begging as set forth in sections 46-53 and 46-54.

Sec. 46-53. - Downtown Melbourne Panhandling Exclusion Area. 
(a)  A panhandling exclusion area is hereby created. Within the panhandling exclusion area, panhandling or begging of any kind is prohibited on property owned in fee simple by a governmental agency, property leased to a governmental agency, and public rights-of-way. 
(b)  The panhandling exclusion area is hereby described as follows:

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 50-1-50-13. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 50-14. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. Further, the city council finds more specifically as follows: 
(1)  Stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into receiving bodies, thereby degrading water quality. 
(2)  The increase in nutrients, such as phosphorous and nitrogen, accelerates eutrophication of receiving water bodies, thereby adversely affecting flora and fauna. 
(3)  Improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation. 
(4)  Construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion. 
(5)  Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases the capacity of said water bodies to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna. 
(6)  Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge. 
(7)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidents of flooding and the level of floods which occur, thereby endangering property and human life. 
(8)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff may interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas, thereby disrupting biological productivity. 
(9)  Substantial economic losses may result from such adverse impacts upon the waters of the city ecosystem. 
(10)  Sound stormwater utility management practices result in the avoidance of future problems concerning the development of land and the maintenance of the quality of the city environment. 
(b)  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain, and enhance both the immediate and the long-term health, safety, and general welfare, of the citizens, residents, and inhabitants of Melbourne, Florida. In order to effectuate this stated purpose, this article has the following objectives: 
(1)  To establish a stormwater management program within the city, which is mutually compatible with those developed by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the St. Johns River Water Management District, Brevard County, and other local governmental entities; 
(2)  To develop a stormwater management program, to be responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of stormwater devices; for stormwater system planning; for review of development plans for compliance with stormwater management codes; and for lake and river quality management; 
(3)  To create one or more stormwater management system benefit areas and adopt stormwater utility fees or assessments sufficient to plan, construct, operate, and maintain stormwater management systems throughout the city; 
(4)  To establish and set aside, as a continuing source of revenue, other funds sufficient to plan, construct, operate, and maintain stormwater management systems throughout the city; 
(5)  To encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between humanity and nature; 
(6)  To protect, restore, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of community waters; 
(7)  To prevent individuals, business organizations, and governments from causing harm to the community, by activities which adversely affect water resources; 
(8)  To encourage the construction of drainage systems which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems; 
(9)  To encourage the protection of natural systems, and the use of such natural systems in ways which do not impair their beneficial functioning; 
(10)  To encourage the use of drainage systems which minimize the consumption of electrical energy, or petroleum fuels, in order to move water, remove pollutants, and maintain said systems; 
(11)  To minimize the transport of pollutants to community waters; 
(12)  To maintain or restore groundwater levels; 
(13)  To protect, maintain, or to restore natural salinity levels in estuarine areas; 
(14)  To minimize erosion and sedimentation; 
(15)  To prevent damage to wetlands; 
(16)  To reduce damage from flooding, while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial; 
(17)  To protect, restore, and maintain the habitat of fish and wildlife; 
(18)  To ensure the attainment of these objectives by requiring the approval and implementation of a stormwater management program for all activities which may have an adverse impact upon community waters; and 
(19)  To seek interlocal agreements with the county and various municipalities located within the county to ensure cooperative efforts toward joint development of compatible and efficient stormwater management programs.

Sec. 50-42. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Melbourne Stormwater Management Ordinance." 
(Code 1980, § 151/2-31; Code 1984, § 27-16) 
Sec. 50-43. - Findings of fact. 
    The city council finds that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the community. More specifically: 
(1)  Stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies, degrading water quality. 
(2)  The increase in nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters, adversely affecting flora and fauna. 
(3)  Improperly channeling water increases the velocity of runoff, thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation. 
(4)  Construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion. 
(5)  Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation, and harms flora and fauna. 
(6)  Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge. 
(7)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering property and human life. 
(8)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff can interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas, thereby disrupting the biological productivity. 
(9)  Substantial economic losses result from these adverse impacts on community waters. 
(10)  Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices. 
(Code 1980, § 151/2-32; Code 1984, § 27-17) 
Sec. 50-44. - Objectives.

    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Melbourne Fertilizer Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2013-09, § 2(27-62), 3-26-2013) 
Sec. 50-110. - Purpose and intent. 
    This article regulates and promotes the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and licensing requirements; establishes a prohibited application period; specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods; fertilizer-free zones; low maintenance zones; and exemptions. The article requires the use of best management practices which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers. These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on city natural and constructed stormwater conveyances and surface waters. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of the city and county residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

(Code 1980, § 29-4; Code 1984, § 28-5) 
Sec. 52-6. - Procedure to initiate street, facility or park name changes; application fee. 
(a)  Application by city. A proposal to change the name of any private or public street or any public facility or park within the city may be initiated by a vote of the city council. Such vote shall constitute direction to the city manager and city attorney to prepare either an ordinance for a street renaming or a resolution for a public facility or park renaming. Said ordinance or resolution shall be classified as an "application," as that term is used herein. Applications initiated by the city council shall be exempt from the requirements of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f)(1) of this section. 
(b)  Application by general public, real property owner, or other governmental agency. Every applicant seeking to change the name of any public or private street or any public facility or park, other than the city, including, but not limited to, an owner of real property within the city, a governmental entity other than the city, or other person, shall be required to file an application pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c) of this section and to satisfy the requirements of subsections (d), (e), and (f) of this section. 
(c)  Application form. A complete application for a change of the name of a street or any public facility or park within the city shall be submitted to the city manager along with the consent to change street name form provided for in subsection (d) of this section and an application fee of $200.00. All costs including notices, mailings, sign changes and associated costs shall be the responsibility of the applicant. When the city determines the costs to be greater than $200.00, an estimate will be provided to the applicant and payment for the difference shall be submitted for the application to be considered complete. Any unutilized funds will be returned to the applicant. 
(d)  Consent by adjacent property owners required for street name changes. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, a property owner is defined as any individual, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity who owns in fee simple or holds a leasehold interest with a remaining term of 30 years or more in real property. 
(2)  At least 70 percent by front footage of the property owners who own real property, any portion of which abuts the right-of-way/street segment which is subject to the application for name change, must execute a consent to change street name form which form shall be attached to the application. A person who has executed a consent form may at any time up until final passage of the ordinance request in writing that his signature be deleted from the consent form. 
a.  In determining if at least 70 percent of the property owners who own real property abutting the right-of-way/street segment which is subject to the application for name change have executed the consent form, the city shall ascertain the total number of front feet of real property abutting both sides of the right-of-way/street segment subject to the application. This number shall form a denominator of a fraction. The numerator shall be the total number of front feet abutting the right-of-way/street segment owned by persons executing the consent form. If the fraction is not greater than 70 percent, then the application shall be deemed to be insufficient for further review and consideration. In computing the overall number of front feet of property which abuts the right-of-way/street segment subject to an application to change street name: 
1.  Public streets and roadways owned by a governmental entity or property owned by the city shall not be considered; and 
2.  Private property which is contiguous at a point shall not be counted. 
b.  In determining whether a person executing a consent form is in fact a fee simple owner of real property able to consent to a street name change as provided herein, the city may use the latest ad valorem tax rolls prepared by the county at the time of receipt of the application or more current evidence of ownership in the form of a deed submitted to the city. No consent shall be valid if it is executed more than 120 days prior to the date of submission of the application to change street name, or if any of the information in subsection (d)(3) of this section is not completed. 
(3)  The consent to change street name form shall be in a format provided by the city manager. 
(e)  Amendments by an applicant petitioning for change of name of city street, facility or park. After the application has been filed, amendments are not permitted without the approval of the city council, or as otherwise permitted in this section. 
(f)  Criteria for renaming a street, facility or park. 
(1)  The following criteria shall be used by the city manager, or designee, to determine whether the city street, facility or park is eligible for renaming: 
a.  The change of name of a city street shall not prove disruptive or adverse to the ability of emergency services, including police, fire, paramedic, ambulance services, and the county's emergency 911 system, to respond to an emergency involving the life, safety, or health of any person. 
b.  If the request is to change the name of a private street, or a public street operated and maintained by other than the city, the city shall attempt to obtain consent to the name change from the owner/operator of the street. 
c.  Required consent from abutting property owners for a street name change, as required in subsection (d), has been met. 
d.  The renaming of a street, facility or park name that has been in existence for 30 years or more will not be considered unless there is a compelling public safety reason. 
e.  Streets, facilities or parks that have already been renamed are not eligible for renaming again. 
f.  Duplicate street names will not be considered. 
g.  Proliferation of the same name for different city streets, facilities or parks shall be avoided. 
h.  Names that promote alcohol and tobacco products or political organizations shall not be considered. 
i.  Names with connotations which by contemporary community standards are derogatory or offensive shall not be considered. 
(2)  The following additional guidelines shall be used by the city manager, or designee, to evaluate the request for renaming a city street, facility or park: 
a.  The cost that the renaming will have on any other person that is or could be materially affected by the name change. 
b.  Use of recognized geographic names. 
c.  Use of natural historic features. 
d.  Cultural or historical significance to the city or surrounding neighborhood. 
e.  Preference to names of long established local usage and names that lend dignity to the street, facility or park. 
f.  When naming for a person: 
1.  A biography and other relevant background information must be included. 
2.  The person must have achieved prominence as a result of his or her significant, positive contribution to the United States, state and/or to the local community. 
3.  The person must have been deceased for at least five years. 
4.  The person must not have been convicted of any felony or crime involving moral turpitude or had pending charges at the time of his or her death. 
5.  If renaming for a living person, the person must have made significant contributions to the community for a period of greater than 25 years. 
6.  The person may not be a current city council member or city employee. 
7.  The person may have made a significant financial contribution to the city or to a specific facility or park. 
(3)  Following a determination that the application is sufficient for consideration or a vote by the city council to initiate consideration as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the city manager, or designee, shall review the application taking into consideration the preceding criteria and shall make a recommendation to the city council regarding the proposed change of name. 
(g)  City council consideration. 
(1)  Upon receipt of a sufficient and completed application, as set forth above or after a vote of the city council pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, as the case may be, and the receipt by the city council of the recommendation of the city manager, the city council shall hold a public hearing regarding the name change. 
(2)  Courtesy notice. 
a.  A courtesy notice shall be prepared and mailed by the city to the property owners of record of any parcel of real property, any portion of which abuts, as described in subsection (d) of this section, the right-of-way/street segment subject to consideration to have its name changed. Courtesy notices will also be mailed to property owners of record within 500 feet of a facility or park that is being considered for renaming. Failure to mail the courtesy notice, failure to include all information in correct form or substance as required herein, or failure of the intended recipient to receive the notice shall not affect any proceeding or action taken with regard to an ordinance to change the name of any segment of any street. The property owners to whom the courtesy notice may be mailed shall be those property owners listed on the latest ad valorem tax rolls prepared by the county at the time of mailing of the courtesy notice. Mailing shall be by first class, United States mail, postage prepaid. Notice shall be deemed to have been given when the courtesy notice is deposited in the United States mail. 
b.  The courtesy notice shall state that a proposal has been made to change the name of a segment of a city street, facility or park, identify the existing and proposed name of the street, facility or park; the date when the change would go into effect; and the end points of the street segment affected. The notice shall also state the time, date and place of the proposed public hearing by the city council. The courtesy notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the second reading of an ordinance to accomplish a name change of the segment of a city street.

(c)  The city manager or manager's designee is hereby delegated with the authority to regulate the times, days, and places of parking, stopping, and standing on any right-of-way subject to the control of the city, in any municipally owned or operated surface parking lot, on any street or highway, or in any municipal parking garage; designated parking spaces; speed limits consistent with state law; the location of one-way streets; whether to install traffic calming devices; traffic flow; and hazardous conditions. In making a determination that a regulation is needed or that an official sign or official traffic control device should be installed, erected, or removed at a given location, the city manager or said manager's designee may coordinate with the city engineer and seek a recommendation from the city engineer. Upon such approval by the city manager or said manager's designee, the city engineer shall conspicuously post official signs, or erect official traffic control devices, advising the public and motor vehicle operators of any parking or motor vehicle operation regulations or designating and regulating the use of parking spaces or implementing the regulation or determination made by the city manager or said manager's designee, relating to traffic flow or hazardous conditions, one-way streets, and speed limits.

Sec. 56-42. - Owner's liability for parking violation. 
(a)  Under authority of F.S. ch. 316, as amended from time to time, the owner of a vehicle is responsible and liable for payment of any parking violation under this article unless the owner can furnish evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the parking violation, stolen or in the care, custody or control of another person, or under lease. In such instances, the owner of the vehicle is required, within a reasonable time after notification of the parking violation, to furnish to the appropriate law enforcement authorities an affidavit setting forth the name and address and driver's license number of the person who leased, rented or otherwise had the care, custody or control of the vehicle. The affidavit submitted is admissible in a proceeding charging a parking ticket violation and raises the rebuttable presumption that the person identified in the affidavit is responsible for payment of the parking ticket violation. The owner of a vehicle shall not be held responsible for parking violations for a vehicle, if the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or in the care, custody or control of some person who did not have permission of the owner to use the vehicle. The owner of a leased vehicle is not responsible for a parking ticket violation and is not required to submit an affidavit or the other evidence specified in this section if the vehicle is registered in the name of the person who leased the vehicle. 
(b)  Prima facie evidence that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or under lease or in the care, custody or control of some person who did not have permission of the owner to use the vehicle, shall be in the form of a report from the appropriate law enforcement official that the said vehicle was stolen or under lease or not under the care, custody or control of the owner of the vehicle.

DIVISION 2. - POLICIES, RULES AND REGULATIONS 

Sec. 58-63. - General policy. 
(a)  Extensions to the water distribution and wastewater collection system shall be made only on the basis of the rules and regulations established herein and with the final approval of the city council. This division does not supersede or alter in any way the provisions for tapping and meter installation for individual services or the charge therefor. 
(b)  As a condition of the issuance of a development order for a site plan, a preliminary development plan, a preliminary subdivision plat, a final subdivision plat, or for endorsement of an Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) permit application for a waterline extension, the applicant shall pay, at the time of issuance of the development order a nonrefundable capacity reservation fee, as defined in appendix D, chapter 3, for water and sewer service. 
(c)  No water or sewer line extension and no metered water service will be made to any property lying beyond the city limits that is within the Melbourne Urban Service Area as defined in the 2001 Joint Planning Agreement and April 2006 First Amendment, between the city and county unless a petition for annexation is presented to the city council by the owner of contiguous property, or, if noncontiguous, a pre-annexation agreement is executed by the owner and city. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, water connections in some areas that are urban service plan areas outside the city will not be permitted, even with a pre-annexation agreement, despite contiguity of the parcels or areas because of special circumstances, which may limit their compactness under special conditions. Such circumstances occur where an election could be called in the foreseeable future for the addition of the area to join the city; where the actual service delivery area and/or boundary adjustment would result in the creation of an illegal enclave, or noncompact area otherwise prohibited by state law; or where the service provision is otherwise inconsistent with the city and county utility service provisions for uniform and consistent planning and boundary adjustment. 
(d)  Platted lots within the Melbourne Urban Service Area that are in subdivisions having existing water or sewer service provided under a utility agreement between the subdivision developer and the city shall be exempt from the annexation and pre-annexation requirements. 
(Code 1980, § 36-36; Code 1984, § 32-41; Ord. No. 91-17, § 1, 3-12-1991; Ord. No. 2003-98, § 1, 1-13-2004; Ord. No. 2006-100, § 1, 10-24-2006)

(Code 1980, § 36-37; Code 1984, § 32-42; Ord. No. 2001-36, § 5, 7-24-2001; Ord. No. 2006-100, § 2, 10-24-2006) 
Sec. 58-65. - General rules. 
(a)  Applicability. The general rules for the extension of water and sewer mains as hereinafter set forth shall apply to all extensions of the municipal water and/or wastewater collection and disposal systems within and without the city, and without respect to whether the extension is for the benefit of an individual consumer or a new subdivision development. 
(b)  Application. Application for the extension of water and/or wastewater disposal service shall be made in writing on a standard form provided by the city. The executed form shall constitute a binding agreement setting forth the terms and conditions under which the service shall be extended. 
(c)  Economic feasibility. Except as later modified herein, all proposed water and sewer main extensions will be analyzed from the standpoint of sound business practices, and all such extensions must conform to the city's economic feasibility test, in order not to impose a burden upon existing customers which would necessitate future rate increases. An extension will be considered economically feasible if the revenue produced by the connection, or connections to the proposed extension, based on anticipated average daily water consumption and, where applicable, wastewater flows as established by the city's engineer, will equal or exceed the cost of operation and maintenance of the system, plus 150 percent of the principal and interest cost of the extension project, based on a 30-year period of time at the then-usual interest rate. An additional 25 percent of the total cost as established above shall be added to the computed cost to determine the cost of providing service to areas beyond the corporate limits of the city. 
(d)  Customer participation. Where anticipated revenue from the sale of water and wastewater disposal service is insufficient to economically warrant a main extension by the city, main extensions may be considered provided the applicant contributes construction funds in an amount sufficient to make the extension economically feasible under the city's feasibility test. 
(e)  Location and installation. Water and sewer mains will be extended and located only in public rights-of-way, or in easements acceptable to the city. In new subdivisions, water and wastewater facilities may be installed only in streets, alleys or other rights-of-way where the finished grade has been established and approved by the appropriate governmental agency. Further, the extension may not be installed until the street, alley or other rights-of-way have been constructed to at least finished subgrade. 
(1)  Inspection and testing of water distribution and wastewater collection system extensions for acceptance shall not be made until the grading, storm sewers, and street improvements are substantially completed. The final inspection for acceptance will be made only from certified as-built drawings, four sets of which shall be furnished to the city upon completion of the installation. 
(2)  A construction permit, issued by the city, will be required prior to starting work. At that time the applicant desiring a permit must show evidence that he has the approved plans from which to construct the work; and also at which time the inspection cost to the applicant, as established in section 58-68 and all other applicant contributions for the cost of construction as set forth in this subsection (e), shall be paid. 
(3)  A 48-hour notice of intent to start work shall be given to the city water and sewer department, at which time all required construction materials, exclusive of brass fittings, shall be on the job site for inspection. 
(f)  Construction standards. All materials, construction procedures, and installation shall be in strict accordance with the applicable sections of the latest revised edition of the Technical Provisions for Construction of Water Distribution Systems, Technical Provisions for Construction of Sanitary Sewer Systems, Technical Provisions for Construction of Sanitary Sewer Lift Stations, and Technical Provisions for Construction of Reclaimed Water Distribution Systems on file with the city's engineer, and subject to the approval and inspection of the city's engineer at all times. Any material, equipment or installation which may be required and is not covered by the city's specifications shall be approved by the city's engineer prior to the start of construction. 
(g)  Ownership. The ownership of any extension and appurtenances laid in accordance with any application shall at all times remain in the city, and an agreement shall be executed to this effect prior to the start of construction. 
(h)  City's rights reserved. No agreement to extend the city's water or wastewater disposal systems under the provisions of this article shall restrict the city's right to make further extensions nor incur any additional obligation to any original participant should the city subsequently extend any original extension. 
(Code 1980, § 36-38; Code 1984, § 32-43; Ord. No. 2001-36, § 6, 7-24-2001; Ord. No. 2006-100, § 3, 10-24-2006) 
Sec. 58-66. - Extension of service for individual property owners within corporate limits. 
(a)  No water or wastewater disposal service extension will be accomplished to platted areas of the city unless it is determined by the city's engineer that the city's participation is financially feasible. In order to be nondiscriminatory and not to impose a burden upon existing customers by necessitating future increased rates, each extension should be self-sustaining. In instances in which the feasibility test indicates that the extension will not be economically self-sustaining, a determination will be made by the city council with due consideration being given to public need, public health, ecology and other pertinent considerations and shall govern the manner and extent of individual property owner or applicant participation. 
(b)  If required, participation shall be paid for at the time of application for water meter installation or sewer service lateral connection and shall be in addition to the usual connection charge. 
(c)  Deferred payments. 
(1)  The cost for such extension may be paid in installments of principal over a period of five years and amount owed shall constitute service charges benefiting the subject property subject to F.S. §§ 159.17 and 159.18. If the benefiting property owner opts to make monthly installments, the property owner shall pay an administrative charge of $250.00 and the property owner must enter into an agreement in form and substance acceptable to the city, which shall be recorded in the public records and shall also constitute a lien against the property until said extension fee has been paid in full. Failure to pay the installments when due shall result, at the city's sole discretion, in acceleration of the entire principal with interest and penalties. 
(2)  Upon failure to pay the extension fee when due, the city may enforce its interests: 
a.  As a statutory lien for failure to pay a delinquent service charge pursuant to F.S. § 159.17; 
b.  By means of termination of utility services for failure to pay a delinquent service charge pursuant to F.S. § 159.18; and 
c.  By means of any other remedy permitted by federal, state, local or other law. 
(d)  In certain cases where public health and welfare may be endangered by the absence of water and wastewater disposal service, the city council may, in the interest of the public, waive the test for financial feasibility and approve the construction of the required extensions using funds which may then be available in appropriate account of the city's water and sewer system. 
(e)  In cases where the city is providing a municipal service to a newly annexed area by making a water service extension, the property owners who wish to become water customers shall, prior to installation of the connection to the water main, pay an extension fee to defray the cost of the water service extension. 
(1)  For property owners who request capacity within 365 days after the date the new water service extension is cleared for service, the extension fee shall be determined as follows: 
a.  To serve a property having frontage of 100 feet or less on the public right-of-way in which the new water extension is constructed, the extension fee shall be $1,000.00. 
b.  To serve a property having frontage greater than 100 feet on the public right-of-way in which the new water extension is constructed, the extension fee shall be $1,000.00 for the first 100 feet of frontage plus $500.00 for each additional 50 feet of frontage or increment thereof. 
(2)  For property owners within a newly annexed area who do not request capacity within 365 days after the new water extension is cleared for service, the extension fee shall be determined as follows: 
a.  To serve a property having frontage of 100 feet or less on the public right-of-way in which the new water extension is constructed, the extension fee shall be $2,000.00. 
b.  To serve a property having frontage greater than 100 feet on the public right-of-way in which the new water extension is constructed, the extension fee shall be $2,000.00 for the first 100 feet of frontage plus $1,000.00 for each additional 50 feet of frontage or increment thereof. 
(Code 1980, § 36-39; Code 1984, § 32-44; Ord. No. 2002-43, § 1, 6-25-2002; Ord. No. 2005-67, § 5, 6-14-2005; Ord. No. 2006-100, § 4, 10-24-2006; Ord. No. 2012-29, § 1, 7-24-2012) 
Sec. 58-67. - Extension of service for individual property owners outside corporate limits. 
(a)  Generally. No water or wastewater disposal service extension will be accomplished unless it is determined by the city manager that the city's participation is financially feasible. In order to be nondiscriminatory and not to impose a burden upon existing customers by necessitating future increased rates, each extension should be self-sustaining. 
(b)  Conditions of city will construct. If it is determined that the city is to construct the water and/or wastewater service extension, the charge or project cost for extending the system will be based on the current construction costs for labor and materials (including piping, valves, fixtures, etc.), which is deemed necessary by the city's engineer for proper water supply or wastewater disposal service to the applicant's designated area. The cost of engineering design and inspection services, where required, will be added to the construction cost. Amounts advanced for water and/or wastewater system extensions, as noted in this section, may be refunded to the applicant in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the city. In no way will the applicant receive more than he originally advanced for the extension of the water and/or wastewater system extension; nor does the city guarantee full payment to the applicant for his original advancement. All refund contracts shall expire five years from the date of their signing. For each new water and/or wastewater customer who connects directly to the aforementioned systems, as previously noted, a prorated front-foot dollar amount based on the total length of property footage served by the system, along the line for the full street frontage of the customer's property, shall be charged to the customer. The prorated charge will be derived from the original project costs experienced by the applicant for extending the system. The amount refunded to the applicant will be a yearly return totaling the number of new water customers that connect to the water and/or wastewater disposal systems financed by the applicant during the aforementioned five-year period. This amount will be refunded not more than 30 days after the city's closing book audit. Collections made by the city after the five-year period will not be refunded. The conditions and provisions outlined under this subsection will not apply to water and/or wastewater system extensions for developers in new subdivisions. 
(c)  Deferred payments. 
(1)  The cost for such extension may be paid in 60 equal, monthly installments of principal over a period of five years and amount owed shall constitute service charges benefiting the subject property subject to F.S. §§ 159.17 and 159.18. If the benefiting property owner opts to make monthly installments, the property owner shall pay an administrative charge of $250.00 and the property owner must enter into an agreement in form and substance acceptable to the city, which shall be recorded in the public records and shall also constitute a lien against the property until said extension fee has been paid in full. Failure to pay the installments when due shall result, at the city's sole discretion, in acceleration of the entire principal with interest and penalties. 
(2)  Upon failure to pay the extension fee when due, the city may enforce its interests: 
a.  As a statutory lien for failure to pay a delinquent service charge pursuant to F.S. § 159.17; 
b.  By means of termination of utility services for failure to pay a delinquent service charge pursuant to F.S. § 159.18; and 
c.  By means of any other remedy permitted by federal, state, local or other law. 
(d)  Conditions if applicant constructs or has constructed by a private company. Should it be determined that the applicant desires to construct the extended line or employs a private company, partnership or individual to construct and extend the water and/or wastewater system extension to his property, he will comply as follows: 
(1)  All construction and costs experienced in extending the water and/or wastewater system will be at the expense of the applicant. 
(2)  All work in extending and developing the water and/or wastewater disposal system within the development shall be to the satisfaction of the city's engineer. 
(3)  Upon completion of extending and developing the water and/or wastewater disposal system extension, up to and within the development, any extension and appurtenances laid throughout the development shall be deeded by the applicant to the city free and clear of all liens, in accordance with the city's standard contract. 
(4)  Section 58-68, regarding extension of water and/or wastewater disposal services for developers, shall be complied with. 
(Code 1980, § 36-40; Code 1984, § 32-45; Ord. No. 86-83, § 1, 11-11-1986; Ord. No. 2002-43, § 2, 6-25-2002; Ord. No. 2012-29, § 2, 7-24-2012) 
State Law reference- Revenue Bond Act, F.S. § 159.01 et seq. 
Sec. 58-68. - Extension of system service for developers. 
(a)  Applicability. Where applications for extensions are made by individuals, partnerships or corporations interested primarily in the development and sale of land and/or homes, and/or where applications are made for extensions to serve commercial or industrial water and/or wastewater disposal system users, the rules in the following subsections apply. 
(b)  Preliminary planning. Preliminary plans and cost estimates shall be prepared by the applicant's engineer. All extensions of the water and waste cater disposal system shall be planned, designed and supervised by a professional engineer registered in the state. 
(c)  Final construction planning. The applicant shall have the engineering services for final construction planning performed by an engineering firm selected by the applicant. The applicant's engineering design, plans, specifications and cost estimate must be reviewed and approved by the city's engineer. Approval of the plans and specifications must be issued by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the approved plans received by the city before construction is started. In the event that construction is not started within the period of one year after the date of the department of environmental protection's approval, resubmission will be required. Upon the completion of construction the applicant's engineer shall submit to both the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and to the city, certified as-built drawings of the final construction. 
(d)  Requirements. The city's engineer shall determine the actual pipe sizes and basic grid layout of the water and wastewater mains and other facilities necessary to extend the city's water distribution and/or wastewater disposal system from the limits of the existing system to the area of development for which service is requested by the applicant. Water mains larger than those required to serve only the areas or developments for which service is requested by the applicant may be required by the city in the interest of future expansion, development and economy. However, the applicant shall be required to pay for the cost of water and sewer mains and other facilities of sufficient size to serve the applicant's development, but in no case less than six-inch pipe for water mains and eight-inch pipe for gravity sewer mains inside the development. Water supply main extensions in general shall be six-inch and eight-inch minimum, and the city shall pay the additional cost for any larger mains required. The city's engineer shall, in the interest of fairness to all concerned, determine the proportionate part of the installation costs to be paid by the applicant and the city, in the event mains larger than required by the specific area or development are to be installed. The minimum size water main shall be six inches and the minimum size gravity sewer mains shall be eight inches. Water and sewer main installations and other related facilities shall be in accordance with the most recent edition of the city's "Detailed Specifications for Materials and Workmanship, Water Distribution System and Sanitary Sewer Lines." The city's engineer shall determine the contribution required by the applicant in all cases requiring city participation in costs. No water or sewer main extensions or subdivision water and/or wastewater disposal system shall be connected to the city's systems until the requirements of this division are met, nor shall such connection be made until an agreement is executed conveying such extensions and systems to the city free and clear of any liens or encumbrances. 
(e)  Deposits for installations. In the event that the installation of water and/or wastewater disposal service is to be accomplished by the city, either by city forces or under contract by the city, the applicant shall deposit with the city his share of the total estimated project costs of the water and wastewater disposal service extension before construction is begun or contract is awarded. The amount of the deposit shall be increased or decreased as required when the actual construction cost of the service extension is determined. 
(1)  In the event the installation of the water service is handled by the applicant through his engineer or contractor, the applicant shall construct and have completed the water distribution and/or wastewater disposal system in his subdivision prior to the award of a contract by the city to make a water or wastewater disposal service extension to the subdivision. In addition, a maintenance and warranty bond shall be furnished to the city and shall remain in effect for one year from the date the system is placed in service and until all work and materials are satisfactory to the city's engineer, and until the applicant furnishes satisfactory evidence that no liens or claims for unpaid bills against the water distribution and/or wastewater disposal system extension exist. If the installation is made by the applicant's contractor, all work will be done under city inspection. Cost of this inspection will be paid for by the applicant. 
(2)  The cost to the developer for city inspection shall be based on the estimated construction, and the inspection fee shall be as set out in section 2-507. 
(Code 1980, § 36-41; Code 1984, § 32-46; Ord. No. 2001-36, § 7, 7-24-2001) 
Sec. 58-69. - Right to decline extensions unless additional guarantees made. 
    Even though the conditions set forth in section 58-68 may be satisfied, some water and/or wastewater disposal system extensions may impose a burden on the city that would be too great to be permanently supported. Therefore, the city reserves the right to decline to construct any extension which it deems uneconomical unless the city is provided additional guarantees, in addition to the contribution and guarantees for the cost of the extension provided for in this article. Such additional guarantees shall be determined by the city's engineer and approved by the city council. 
(Code 1980, § 36-42; Code 1984, § 32-47) 
Sec. 58-70. - Disposition of funds received. 
    The city shall not be obligated to pay interest on any advance made to it. All sums advanced to the city under the terms of this article for extension of water and/or wastewater disposal systems shall be deposited by the city to the credit of the city according to appropriate existing resolutions.

Sec. 58-133. - Water service rates. 
(a)  Description of rate structure. 
(1)  The rate charged for potable water service to each customer shall consist of a monthly service charge based on the number of equivalent residential connections (ERCs) determined by the city periodically for the premises or point of connection, which shall serve as the minimum bill, and a gallonage charge for each unit of 1,000 gallons or portion thereof as metered at the premises or point of connection. Such charges shall be due and payable on a monthly basis. The property owner for the premises that receives the potable water service from the city shall be the customer except during such time that service is requested by a tenant customer, located at such premises, as allowed by the property owner. The rates for potable water service are charged based on the customer's location. Customers located within the city limits are charged the inside city rate. Customers located outside the city limits are charged the outside city rate. 
(2)  As long as service is provided to the premises of the property owner, the property owner shall be considered as the customer, except as noted above. Service shall be considered as being provided to the premises if there is installed a water meter available to measure potable water service to such premises. The temporary discontinuance of service at the request of a customer, whether the property owner or new owner/tenant customer, does not render a customer inactive from service availability and billing basis and shall not be considered as the discontinuance of service to such premises and the customer shall be responsible for all monthly charges due for the provision of service. 
(b)  Monthly service charge. 
(1)  Each customer connected to the city's potable water system shall pay a monthly service charge based on the number of equivalent residential connections (ERCs) and the effective rate per ERC being served at such connection as determined by the city for each potable water customer as defined in the following table: 
Rate per ERC - All Customers Effective 
Date Inside 
City Outside 
the City October 1, 2013 $7.58 $8.34 October 1, 2014 $8.00 $8.80 October 1, 2019 $8.44 $9.28 October 1, 2020 $8.90 $9.79  
(2)  The determination of the ERCs shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  Individually metered residential service customers includes all connections for individually metered dwelling units as defined by appendix D, article IV, chapter 3, section 3.46. Each such individually metered residential unit shall equate to one equivalent residential connection or ERC for the application of the monthly service charge. One ERC shall represent an average daily potable water flow of 240 gallons per day. 
b.  All other customers not classified as individually metered residential service customers shall be calculated individually for the determination of the number of ERCs applicable at a metered premises. 
For existing customers classified under this customer designation, the determination of the total ERCs shall be based on the greater of: 
1.  The monthly average water consumption divided by the monthly potable water allowance per ERC of 7,000 gallons, but not less than one ERC; or 
2.  The ERCs implied by the size of the meter serving the premises using the meter ERC factor determined by using meter equivalent factors based on information published by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) regarding meter capacities in the following amounts shown below. For new customers that have no previous water consumption history based at the premises (newly constructed unit or a redeveloped unit that changed the nature of the property use and which an impact fee was calculated per section 58-131), the number of ERCs to be assigned to the respective customer will be based on the daily potable water flow requirements of the customer determined during the permitting process by the city expressed on an average monthly basis or determined in accordance with the formula above for existing customers.

All meters larger than six inches will be charged a maximum of 50 ERCs. 
c.  The city shall have the right to adjust the determination of the amount of ERCs assigned to a customer based on the change in average monthly water consumption at least once per year, unless there is a change in the customer characteristics which would necessitate the need to determine additional capacity fees becoming due and the need to assign additional ERCs to the customer. 
d.  Meter sizing shall be independent of any ERC calculation for the application of the monthly service charge. 
(c)  Gallonage charge. In addition to the above established service charge, each customer shall pay a monthly gallonage charge per unit for each 1,000 gallons, or portion thereof, of water as metered at the customer's premises in accordance with the schedule set forth below:

Sec. 58-243. - Sewer service rates. 
(a)  Description of rate structure. 
(1)  The rate charged for sewer service to each customer shall consist of a monthly service charge based on the number of equivalent residential connections (ERCs) being served at such connection as determined by the city periodically for the premise, which shall serve as the minimum bill, and a gallonage charge for each unit of 1,000 gallons or portion thereof based on the quantity of potable water metered at the premises. Such charges shall be due and payable on a monthly basis. The property owner for the premises that receives the sewer service from the city shall be the customer except during such time that service is requested by a tenant customer, located at such premise, as allowed by the property owner. The rates for sewer service are charged based on the customer's location. Customers located within the city limits are charged the inside city rate. Customers located outside the city limits are charged the outside city rate. 
(2)  As long as service is provided to the premises of the property owner, the property owner shall be considered as the customer, except as noted above. Service shall be considered as being provided to the premises if there is installed a water meter available to measure potable water service to such premises. The temporary discontinuance of service at the request of a customer, whether the property owner or new owner/tenant customer, does not render a customer inactive from service availability and billing basis and shall not be considered as the discontinuance of service to such premises and the customer shall be responsible for all monthly charges used for the provision of service. 
(b)  Monthly service charge. 
(1)  Each customer connected to the city's sewer system shall pay a monthly service charge based on the number of equivalent residential connections (ERCs) and the effective rate per ERC determined by the city for each sewer customer defined in the following table: 
Rate per ERC - All Customers Effective 
Date Inside 
City Outside 
the City October 1, 2013 $11.21 $14.01 October 1, 2014 $11.83 $14.78 October 1, 2019 $12.48 $15.59 October 1, 2020 $13.16 $16.45  
(2)  The determination of the ERCs shall be determined in accordance with the following: 
a.  Individually metered residential service customers includes all connections for individually metered dwelling units as defined by appendix D, article IV, chapter 3, section 3.46. Each such individually metered residential unit shall equate to one equivalent residential connection or ERC for the application of the monthly service charge. One ERC shall represent an average daily sewer flow of 240 gallons per day. 
b.  All other customers not classified as individually metered residential service customers shall be calculated individually for the determination of the number of ERCs applicable at a metered premises. For existing customers classified under this customer designation, the determination of the total ERCs shall be performed periodically and shall be based on the greater of: 
1.  The monthly average billed sewer consumption divided by the average monthly billed sewer allowance per ERC of 7,000 gallons, but not less than one ERC; or 
2.  The ERCs implied by the size of the meter serving the premises using the meter ERC factor determined by using meter equivalent factors based on information published by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) regarding meter capacities in the following amounts shown below. 
c.  For new customers that have no previous billed sewer flow or consumption history based at the premises (newly constructed unit or a redeveloped unit that changed the nature of the property use and which an impact fee was calculated per section 58-242), the number of ERCs to be assigned to the respective customer will be based on the daily sewer flow requirements of the customer as determined as part of the permitting process expressed on an average monthly basis or determined in accordance with the formula above for existing customers: 
Meter 
Size 
(inches) ERC 
per 
AWWA 0.75 1 1.0 3 1.5 5 2.0 8 3.0 15 4.0 25 6.0 50  
All meters larger than six inches will be charged a maximum of 50 ERCs. 
d.  The city shall have the right to adjust the determination of the amount of ERCs assigned to a customer based on the change in average monthly billed sewer flow or consumption at least once per year, unless there is a change in the customer characteristics which would necessitate the need to determine additional capacity fees becoming due. 
e.  Where a customer has received a permit for and has installed an individual gray water disposal system, a credit equal to 50 percent of the monthly service and gallonage charges shall be allowed. Provided, however, that if the gray water system is abandoned for any reason, this credit will no longer be allowed. 
(c)  Gallonage charge. Each customer connected to the city's sewer system to whom a monthly bill shall be rendered for water furnished by the city's water system shall pay a charge per 1,000 gallons, or portion thereof, of water passed through the water meter for sewer services in accordance with the schedule set forth below: 
Effective 
Date Inside 
City Outside

(d)  Adjustments to bills. The city manager or his designee shall be authorized to provide adjustments to sewer bills resulting from excessive water consumption because of leaks in the water service lines, defective plumbing fixtures, filling of a swimming pool, or unusual circumstances where the water did not enter the sanitary sewer system as waste pursuant to the following conditions: 
(1)  Excessive water consumption is defined as water consumption resulting from one of the above described causes, where the billed consumption exceeds the average monthly consumption for the previous six months by at least 100 percent and is a minimum of 10,000 gallons above said monthly average. 
(2)  The account holder shall submit a written request for adjustment within 60 days of the date of the bill for which adjustment is requested. 
(3)  The account holder must establish that the water did not flow through the sanitary sewer system. 
(4)  An adjustment to a sewer bill has not been granted in the previous 12 months. 
(5)  In the event the excessive water consumption crosses two billing cycles, the calculation for the adjustment shall be based upon the average monthly consumption which exceeds two times the average monthly consumption for the previous six months pursuant to the limitations described in subsection (d)(1) of this section. An adjustment that is provided in this subsection shall only be authorized when the customer demonstrates that corrective action is taken within ten days of the billing date when the excessive consumption first occurred.

(Code 1984, § 32-328; Ord. No. 99-47, § 66, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 3, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-282. - Pretreatment standards; categorical standards. 
(a)  Pretreatment standards specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which have the potential to be discharged in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6, as of July 1, 2009, to a WWF by existing or new industrial users, in specific industrial subcategories, are established as separate federal regulations under the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471, and which have been incorporated by reference in F.A.C. 62-625.410. These standards are hereby adopted and incorporated herein. These pretreatment standards, unless specifically noted otherwise, shall be in addition to all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in sections 58-279 through 58-293. 
(b)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. 
(c)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
(d)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the coordinator shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with F.A.C. 62-625.410(6). 
(e)  When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the coordinator. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsection (e)(1) of this section. 
(1)  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
a.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will, employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
b.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
c.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
d.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
e.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
1.  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
(i)  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
(ii)  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
(iii)  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (e)(1)c of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
(iv)  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection (e)(1)a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
2.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the coordinator: 
(i)  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
(ii)  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
(iii)  May retain the same equivalent mass limits in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 58-285. The industrial user must also be in compliance with section 58-334 regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
(f)  The coordinator may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for the purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the coordinator. 
(g)  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(h)  Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
(i)  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the coordinator within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate. 
(Code 1984, § 32-329; Ord. No. 99-47, § 67, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 4, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-283. - Pretreatment standards; local limits. 
(a)  The public works and utilities director is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to F.A.C. 62-625.400(3). 
(b)  The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the local limits for those pollutants which have been established for the city's WWF using standard procedures, calculations and methods acceptable to FDEP to protect against pass through, interference, protection of WWF employees, and adverse effects on wastewater residuals disposal. No industrial user shall discharge process wastestreams, unregulated wastestreams, or dilute wastestreams in excess of the concentrations set forth by the director. Local limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached to each SIU/MIU wastewater permit issued. 
(c)  The established local limits are subject to change and shall be modified as needed based on regulatory requirements and standards, WWF operation, performance and processes, the industrial user base, potable water quality and domestic wastewater characteristics. Modifications to the established local limits must be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to implementation. Implementation shall be effective 30 days from notice of acceptance of the modified limits by FDEP. Permitted SIUs and MIUs shall also be issued an addendum to their wastewater discharge permit containing the new local limit. 
(d)  The established local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWF. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. At his discretion, the public works and utilities director may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations. 
(e)  The coordinator may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of section 58-281. 
(f)  A copy of the approved local limits is available upon request at the following location: 835 N Apollo Blvd. Melbourne, FL 32935.

(a)  Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination request under F.A.C. 62-625.410(2)(d), whichever is later, existing categorical users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the WWF shall submit to the coordinator a baseline monitoring report (BMR) which contains the information listed in subsection (b) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the coordinator a report which contains the information listed in subsection (b) of this section. A new source shall include in this report information on the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections (b)(4) and (5) of this section. 
(b)  Users described above shall submit the following information: 
(1)  Identifying information. The industrial user shall submit the name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owners. 
(2)  Permits. The industrial user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
(3)  Description of operations. The industrial user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification codes (SIC) of the operations carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the WWF from the regulated processes. 
(4)  Flow measurement. The industrial user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the WWF from each of the following: 
a.  Regulated process streams; and 
b.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of F.A.C. 62-625.410(6). The control authority shall allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
a.  The industrial user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
b.  In addition, the industrial user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or by the control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge of each regulated process. Both daily maximum, and average concentration (or mass, where required), shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the coordinator or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
c.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to demonstrate that data is in compliance with the standard. 
d.  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities, if such exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of F.A.C. 62-625.410(6) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternative concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with F.A.C. 62-625.410(6), this adjusted limit, along with supporting data, shall be submitted to the coordinator. 
e.  All activities related to sampling and analysis shall comply with section 58-312 and 58-313, and F.A.C. ch. 62-160.

f.  The industrial user may submit a baseline monitoring report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
g.  The baseline monitoring report shall indicate the time, date, and place, of sampling; methods of analysis; and test results for each component, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the WWF. 
(6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether operation and maintenance (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the industrial user shall provide such additional pretreatment or O&M as specified in a compliance schedule. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
a.  If the categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by the combined wastestream formula in accordance with F.A.C. 62-625.410(6), a removal credit in accordance with F.A.C. 62-625.420, or a fundamentally different factor variance in accordance with F.A.C. 62-625.700, at the time the industrial user submits the report required by this subsection, the information requested in subsections (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits. 
b.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by the combined wastestream formula in, a removal credit, or a fundamentally different factor variance after the industrial user submits the report required by this subsection, any necessary amendment to the information requested in subsections (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the industrial user to the coordinator within 60 days after the limit is approved. 
(8)  Signature and certification. All baseline-monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 58-295.

Sec. 58-305. - Compliance schedule and progress reports for meeting categorical pretreatment standards. 
    The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by section 58-304(b)(7): 
(1)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction). 
(2)  No increment referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall exceed nine months. 
(3)  Within 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the coordinator including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the coordinator. 
(Code 1984, § 32-351; Ord. No. 99-47, § 89, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 23, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-306. - Final reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. 
    Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWF, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the coordinator a report containing the information described in section 58-304(b)(4) through (6). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in F.A.C. 62-625.410(4), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 58-295. 
(Code 1984, § 32-352; Ord. No. 99-47, § 90, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 24, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-307. - Periodic reports on continued compliance. 
(a)  All significant industrial users and minor industrial users shall submit to the coordinator during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the coordinator, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the coordinator or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. The industrial user may request submission of the above reports in months other than June and December if, based on such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, or budget cycles, the alternate dates more accurately represent actual operating conditions. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 58-295. 
(b)  The coordinator may authorize the industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to waive sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical standard if the industrial user demonstrates the following through sampling and other technical factors: 
(1)  The pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or the pollutant is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user; and 
(2)  The pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical pretreatment standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(c)  This authorization of the monitoring waiver is subject to the following conditions and does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as specified in the categorical pretreatment standard: 
(1)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the permit or other equivalent control mechanism, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism. 
(2)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. Non-detectable sample results may be only used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the department approved method from F.A.C. 62-4.246, with the lowest method detection limit for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(3)  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 58-295. 
(4)  The authorization must be included as a condition in the industrial user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the control authority for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
(5)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the industrial user's control mechanism by the control authority, the industrial user must certify each report with the following statement: 
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR [specify applicable national pretreatment standard parts], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list pollutants] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under F.A.C. 62-625.600(4)(a)." 
(6)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present, or is expected to be present, based on changes that occur in the industrial user's operation, the industrial user must immediately notify the coordinator and comply with the monitoring requirements imposed by the coordinator. 
(7)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(d)  The coordinator may reduce the requirement in subsection (a) of this section to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the department, where the industrial user meets all the following conditions: 
(1)  The industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not: 
a.  Exceed 0.01 percent of the dry weather hydraulic capacity of the WWF, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by continuous effluent monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in batches; 
b.  Exceed 0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the WWF; and 
c.  Exceed 0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local limits were developed for a WWF in accordance with F.A.C. 62-625.400(3). 
(2)  The industrial user has not been in significant noncompliance in the past two years; and 
(3)  The industrial user does not have daily flows rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant to section 58-313. 
(e)  The industrial user must notify the control authority immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of subsections (d)(1) or (2) of this section. Upon notification, the industrial user must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in subsection (a) of this section. 
(f)  Where the coordinator has imposed mass limitations on industrial users as provided for by section 58-285, the report required by subsection (a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the discharge from the industrial user. 
(g)  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance with the procedures in F.A.C. 62-625.410(4), the report required by subsection (a) of this section shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by subsection (a) of this section shall include the industrial user's actual production rate for the reporting period. 
(h)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 58-295. 
(i)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge during the period covered by the report. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(j)  If a user subject to the reporting requirements in this section monitors any regulated pollutants at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in sections 58-312 and 58-313, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(Code 1984, § 32-353; Ord. No. 99-47, § 91, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 25, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-308. - Reports of changed conditions. 
(a)  All industrial users shall promptly notify the coordinator, in advance of any change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge that may result in pass through or interference at the WWF. 
(b)  The coordinator may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 58-298. 
(c)  The public works and utilities director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 58-300 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.

Sec. 58-309. - Reports of potential problems, including slug discharges. 
(a)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug discharge, that may cause potential problems for the WWF, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the coordinator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(b)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the coordinator, submit a detailed written report describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees who could cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(d)  Significant industrial users and minor industrial users are required to notify the coordinator immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(Code 1984, § 32-355; Ord. No. 99-47, § 93, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 27, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-310. - Reports required from unpermitted users. 
    All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the coordinator as the coordinator may require. 
(Code 1984, § 32-355.1; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 28, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-311. - Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting. 
    If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the coordinator by telephone or e-mail within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the coordinator within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the coordinator monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the coordinator samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. If the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. 
(Code 1984, § 32-356; Ord. No. 99-47, § 94, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 29, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-312. - Analytical requirements. 
    All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with applicable test procedures identified in 40 CFR 136, as of July 1, 2009, hereby adopted and incorporated by reference. If a test for a specific component is not listed in 40 CFR 136, or if the test procedure has been determined to be inappropriate for the analyte in question (e.g., insufficient sensitivity), the laboratory, with the approval of the industrial user and control authority, shall identify and propose a method for use in accordance with F.A.C. 62-160.300 and 62-160.330. If a sampling procedure is not available or none of the approved procedures are appropriate for collecting the samples, the sampling organization, with the approval of the industrial user and city, shall identify and propose a method for use in accordance with F.A.C. 62-160.220. 
(Code 1984, § 32-357; Ord. No. 99-47, § 95, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 30, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-313. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report. 
(b)  The reports required in sections 58-304, 58-306 and 58-307 shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the control authority, of pollutants contained herein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the industrial user. Where the control authority performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the industrial user shall not be required to submit the compliance certification required under sections 58-304(b)(6) and 58-306. In addition, where the control authority itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user shall not be required to submit the report. All laboratory analytical reports prepared by the industrial user or the control authority shall comply with F.A.C. 62-160.340. 
(c)  For all sampling required by this article, grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, fats, oils and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the sample must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in F.A.C. ch. 62-160, and DEP-SOP-001/01, multiple grabs collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as follows: 
(1)  Samples for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; 
(2)  Samples for volatile organics and fats, oils and grease may be composited in the laboratory; and 
(3)  Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as allowed in the department's approved sampling procedures and laboratory methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. 
(d)  Fats, oils and grease samples shall be collected in accordance with subsection (c) of this section unless the sampling location or point cannot be physically accessed to perform a direct collection of a grab sample. In these instances, the sample shall be pumped from the sampling location or point into the sample container using a peristaltic type pump. All pump tubing used for sample collection must be new or pre-cleaned and must be changed between sample containers and sample points. The pump tubing shall not be pre-rinsed or flushed with sample prior to collecting the sample. The report of analysis shall indicate that a peristaltic pump was used to collect the fats, oils and grease sample. 
(e)  Sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in sections 58-304 and 58-306 shall be conducted as follows: 
(1)  For industrial users where historical sampling data do not exist, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, fats, oils, and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds; and 
(2)  For industrial users where historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. 
(f)  For the reports required by section 58-307, the control authority shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and ensure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(g)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in section 58-307 monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate monitoring location more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures required by subsection (d) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(Code 1984, § 32-358; Ord. No. 99-47, § 96, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 31, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-314. - Provisions governing fraud and false statements. 
    Any person, including a responsible corporate officer, submitting or maintaining reports and other documents required under this article shall be subject to the civil and criminal penalties of F.S. § 403.161, or any falsification described in that section.

All sampling and analysis activities shall be subject to the record keeping requirements specified in F.A.C. ch. 62-160. 
(b)  Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this division, including documentation associated with best management practices, shall be required to retain for a minimum of three years (1,095 days) any records of monitoring and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this article), and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the department and control authority. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user. 
(Code 1984, § 32-360; Ord. No. 99-47, § 98, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 34, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-317. - Right of entry; inspection and sampling. 
(a)  The coordinator, or other code enforcement officer designated under section 58-326, shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this division and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the coordinator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(b)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the coordinator will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(c)  The coordinator shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(d)  The coordinator may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. 
(e)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the coordinator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(f)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the coordinator access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this Code. 
(Code 1984, § 32-361; Ord. No. 99-47, § 99, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 35, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-318. - Administration inspection warrants. 
(a)  If the coordinator has been refused access to a commercial building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and pursuant to F.S. § 933.22, as amended or superseded from time to time, is able to demonstrate cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then, upon application by the city attorney, the county court shall issue an inspection warrant describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the public works and utilities director in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city. 
(b)  In the event of an emergency affecting public health and safety, or if the industrial user consents, inspection shall be made without the issuance of a warrant. 
(Code 1984, § 32-362; Ord. No. 99-47, § 100, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 36, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 58-319. - Confidential information. 
(a)  Information and data obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the coordinator's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless, pursuant to section F.S. § 403.111, as amended or superseded from time to time, the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the coordinator, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production, entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. In addition, trade secrets, as defined by F.S. § 812.081, are confidential and exempt from the public records law pursuant to F.S. § 815.045. 
(b)  When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined in 40 CFR 2.302, shall not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

Sec. 58-321. - Notification of violation. 
    When the coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or an order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the coordinator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation (NOV). Within ten days of receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user from liability for any violations before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(Code 1984, § 32-365; Ord. No. 99-47, § 103, 10-12-1999) 
Sec. 58-322. - Consent orders. 
    The public works and utilities director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 58-324 and 58-325 and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(Code 1984, § 32-366; Ord. No. 99-47, § 104, 10-12-1999; Ord. No. 2011-55, § 39, 12-13-2011)

Thereafter, the public works and utilities director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time period, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. 
(b)  A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(c)  De novo appeals to the city manager may be taken by any person whose wastewater discharge is suspended. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days following the date of the rendition of the order of the public works and utilities director by filing with the public works and utilities director's office a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The public works and utilities director shall, within 15 days thereafter, transmit to the city manager all papers constituting the record upon which the action of appeal was taken.

PREFACE 
    This Volume II contains Part III, the Land Development Regulations of the city and Part IV, the franchises and constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Melbourne, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 Code, as supplemented through March 27, 2012, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The appendices comprising the Land Development Regulations have been conveniently arranged and designated, and the various sections within each appendix have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the appendix together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the appendix is included at the back of this volume. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The section numbering system used in each appendix of the land development regulations is a numerical system beginning with section 1 and in the case of the land development code, appendix D is a decimal system. Under this system, each section is identified with its numerical position, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 1 and 2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this volume is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a page in the chapter of the Appendix D, the Land Development Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the appendix and the number of the chapter. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Cathleen A. Wysor, City Clerk, Paul Gougelman, former City Attorney, Alison Dawley, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Appendix A - AIRPORT ZONING ORDINANCE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein as appendix A of Part III. Land Development Regulations is the airport zoning ordinance, formerly appendix A, as enacted on March 13, 1979. The zoning map referred to herein is not set out; it may be found on file in the office of the city clerk. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. Words appearing in brackets have been added for clarification. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to statutes and expression of numbers in text have been used as appears in the Part II. Code of Ordinances. 
State Law reference- Airport zoning, F.S. ch. 333. 

Sec. 1. - Short title. 
    This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Melbourne International Airport Zoning Ordinance." 
Sec. 2. - Definitions. 
    As used in this ordinance, unless the context otherwise requires: 
(a)  Airport means the Melbourne International Airport, Melbourne, Florida. 
(b)  Airport elevation: The highest point of an airport's usable landing area measured in feet from mean sea level as set forth on an airport hazard zoning map attached to this regulation. 
(c)  Airport hazard: Any structure or object of natural growth located on or in the vicinity of a public airport, or any use of land near such airport, which obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or takeoff at such airport or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or takeoff of aircraft. 
(d)  Structure: An object constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation to, buildings, towers, smokestacks, earth formation and overhead transmission lines. 
(e)  Tree: Any object of natural growth. 
(f)  Nonconforming use: Any preexisting structure, object of natural growth or use of land which is inconsistent with the provisions of this regulation or an amendment thereto. 
(g)  Height: For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this regulation and shown on the zoning maps, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
(h)  Runway: A defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
(i)  Visual runway: A runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved airport layout plan or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority. 
(j)  Utility runway: A runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller-driven aircraft of 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and less. 
(k)  Nonprecision instrument runway: A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure which has been approved or planned and for which no precision approach facilities are planned or indicated on an FAA planning document or military service's military airport planning document. 
(l)  Precision instrument runway: A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an instrument landing system (ILS) or a precision approach radar (PAR). It also means a runway for which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated on an FAA approved layout plan, a military service's approved military airport layout plan, any other FAA planning document or military service's military airport planning document. 
(m)  Primary surface: A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway, but when the runway has no specially prepared hard surface or planned hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface of a runway will be 250 feet for utility runways having only visual approaches and 1,000 feet for a precision instrument runway and for a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile.

Sec. 3. - Airport zoning map. 
    In order to outline definitely the horizontal and vertical limits beyond which the projection of any structure or tree will constitute an airport hazard, the airport zoning map, dated July, 1975, of the Melbourne Regional Airport, City of Melbourne, Florida, prepared by Bristol Childs and Crowder Associates, attached hereto but not reproduced herein, is hereby incorporated into this ordinance and made a part thereof. The established elevation of the airport is 33 feet as shown by said Melbourne Regional Airport Zoning Map. 
Sec. 4. - Airport zones. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this regulation, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land and airspace lying within the approach zone, transitional zones, horizontal zones and conical zones as they apply to a particular airport. Such zones are shown on the airport hazard zoning maps which are attached to this regulation and made a part hereof or may hereafter be adopted for attachment. Airport hazard zoning maps are on file in the office of the Melbourne city clerk. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(a)  Utility runway visual approach zone: This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which is 250 feet wide and coincides with the end of the primary surface. It expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the runway. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically. 
(b)  Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach zone: This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which is 500 feet wide and coincides with the end of the primary surface. It expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the runway. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically. 
(c)  Runway larger than utility visual approach zone. This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which is 500 feet wide and coincides with the end of the primary surface. It expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the runway. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically. 
(d)  Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than three-fourths mile nonprecision instrument approach zone: This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which is 500 feet wide and coincides with the end of the primary surface. It expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the runway. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of 34 feet horizontally for each foot vertically. 
(e)  Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as three-fourths mile nonprecision instrument approach zone: This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which is 1,000 feet wide and coincides with the end of the primary surface. It expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the runway. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of 34 feet horizontally for each foot vertically. 
(f)  Precision instrument runway approach zone: This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which is 1,000 feet wide and coincides with the end of the primary surface. It expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the runway. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of 50 feet horizontally for each foot vertically for a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet and thence 40 feet horizontally to each foot vertically for the remaining length of the control zone. 
(g)  Heliport visual flight rules (VFR) approach zone: This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which coincides with the width of the primary surface. It expands outward to a width of 500 feet at a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the primary surface. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of eight feet horizontally for each foot vertically. 
(h)  Heliport instrument flight rules (IFR) approach zone: This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which is 300 feet wide and coincides with the width of the primary surface. It expands outward to a width of 3,400 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the primary surface. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of 15 feet horizontally for each foot vertically. 
(i)  STOL precision instrument approach zone: This zone underlies an approach surface, the inner edge of which is 300 feet wide and coincides with the width of the primary surface. It expands outward to a width of 3,400 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet measured along the extended center line of the primary surface. The approach surface slopes upward from the inner edge at the rate of 15 feet horizontally for each foot vertically. 
(j)  Transitional zones: These zones underlie the transitional surfaces which extend outward and upward at 90-degree angles to the runway center line and center line extended at a slope seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Where the precision runway approach surface projects beyond the limits of the conical surface, the transitional surface shall continue upward and outward from the approach surface at the rate of seven feet horizontally from one foot vertically for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway center line. 
(k)  Heliport VFR transitional zones: These zones underlie transitional surfaces which slope upward and outward two feet vertically for each foot horizontally beginning at the sides of the primary surface and the approach surfaces, and extending to a distance of 250 feet measured horizontally from and at 90 degrees to the primary surface center line and extended center line. 
(l)  Heliport IFR transitional zones: These zones underlie transitional surfaces which slope upward and outward four feet vertically for each foot horizontally beginning at the sides of the primary surface and the approach surfaces, and extending a distance of 350 feet measured horizontally from and at 90 degrees to the primary surface center line and extended center line. 
(m)  STOL precision instrument transitional zones: These zones underlie the transitional surfaces which begin at the sides of the primary surface and slope upward and outward four feet horizontally and one foot vertically for a horizontal distance of 400 feet and slope upward and outward four feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the approach zones a variable horizontal distance of 400 feet at the primary surface end to zero feet at a horizontal distance of 1,500 feet measured outward along the extended primary surface center line. 
(n)  Horizontal zone: This zone underlies a horizontal surface having an elevation of 150 feet above the airport elevation. The horizontal dimensions of the surface are established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet (for all runways designated as utility or visual) or 10,000 feet (for all others) radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(o)  Conical zone: This zone underlies a conical surface which commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends upward and outward 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically for a distance of 4,000 feet. 
Sec. 5. - Airport zone and airspace height limitations. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or be maintained in any zone created by this regulation to a height in excess of the applicable height established for such zone. 
(b)  In addition to the height limitations within the aforesaid zones no structure shall be erected to a height of 200 feet above the airport elevation within three nautical miles of such airport, a height of 300 feet within four nautical miles, a height of 400 feet within five nautical miles of such airport, or elsewhere at a height of 500 feet above the ground at the site of the proposed structure, unless it can be shown: 
(1)  That notice of proposed construction or alteration has been given as required by Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. 
(2)  That the proposed structure will not raise the Federal Aviation Administration established minimum descent altitude or decision height for an instrument approach to any runway, or cause the minimum obstruction clearance altitude or minimum en route altitude to be increased on any federal airway. 
(3)  That the structure does not otherwise constitute an obstruction to air navigation. 
Sec. 6. - Use restrictions. 
    In addition to any land use restrictions contained in these regulations, it shall be unlawful to make any use of land or water within any airport zone established by this regulation in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport. (This does not affect the use of grove heaters for agricultural purposes.) 
Sec. 7. - Lighting. 
    The owner of any structure over 200 feet above ground level must install on that structure lighting in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 79-7460-1C and amendments. 
Sec. 8. - Nonconforming uses. 
    The regulations prescribed in sections 5 and 6 of this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date hereof, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance and is diligently prosecuted and completed. 
Sec. 9. - Marking and lighting. 
    Notwithstanding provisions of section 8 hereinabove, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon during hours of darkness of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airports the presence of such hazards. Such markers shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the operation of the airport. 
Sec. 10. - Conflicting regulations. 
    When this section [ordinance] imposes a greater or more stringent restriction upon the use of land than is imposed or required by any other section [regulation], the provisions of this section [ordinance] shall govern. Nothing contained in this section [ordinance] shall, however, be interpreted to conflict with or supersede any federal regulation pertaining to the control of airport hazards. 
Sec. 11. - Variances. 
    Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this ordinance, may apply for a variance therefrom. Such variance shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance. 
Sec. 12. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land, and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any airport approach surface zone, horizontal surface zone, conical surface zone or transitional surface zone, unless a permit from the city building department therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each such application shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted. 
(b)  Existing uses. Before any existing use, structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher or replanted, within any airport approach surface zone, horizontal surface zone, conical surface zone or transitional surface zone, a permit must be secured from the city building department authorizing such replacement, change or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or than it is when application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applicants for a permit for replacement, change or repair of existing use, structure or tree shall be granted. 
Sec. 13. - Board of adjustment. 
(a)  The board of adjustment of the City of Melbourne shall have and exercise the following powers: 
(1)  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this ordinance. 
(2)  To hear and decide specific variances under section 9.

ARTICLE III. - ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING MAP AND DISTRICTS 

Sec. 1. - Zoning map. 
    The boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on a map entitled "The Zoning Map of the City of Melbourne," on file in the community development department, which map, with all explanatory matter thereon, shall be deemed to accompany, be, and is hereby made a part of this code. 
    The official zoning map shall bear the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to as Ordinance Number 2005-120 of the City of Melbourne, Florida" together with the date of the adoption of this code. 
    If, in accordance with the provisions of this code and applicable Florida law, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be made on the official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the city council. A zoning number and an ordinance number shall be given to each change and a file of such changes kept by the community development department. Any amending ordinance shall provide that such changes or amendments, including rezoning of a parcel of land or issuance of a conditional use on a parcel of land, shall not become effective until 30 days from the date of rendition of the ordinance, and if appealed or otherwise judicially contested, until resolution of any judicial contests or appeals. The change or amendment shall be duly recorded within five business days after the 30-day period has expired and resolution of any judicial contests or appeals. 
    No zoning changes shall be made on the official zoning map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this code. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this code and punishable as provided under this code, the Melbourne City Code, or Florida Statutes. 
    Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map which shall be stored in the community development department when not in use and readily available to the public, shall be the final authority as the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the city. 
(A)  Replacement of official zoning map. In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the city council may by resolution adopt a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor attested by the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of Ordinance No. 2005-120 of the City of Melbourne, Florida." Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. 
(B)  Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
(2)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
(3)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following city limits. 
(4)  Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks. 
(5)  Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow the high water mark and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as moving within the high water mark; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
(6)  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections (1) through (5) above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said zoning map. 
(7)  In cases where the actual location of physical features varies from those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered by subsections (1) through (6) above, the city council shall interpret the district boundaries. 
(C)  Water areas. All areas within the city which are under water and not shown as included within any district shall be subject to all the requirements of the district which immediately adjoins or abuts the water area. If the water area adjoins two or more districts the boundaries of each district shall be construed to extend into the water area in a straight line as projected until they intersect a projected line from other district boundaries. 
(D)  Vacations; built-up land. Whenever any street, alley or other right-of-way is vacated by official action of the Council of the City of Melbourne, the use district and area regulations governing the property abutting upon each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation and all area included within the vacation shall thereafter be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended use districts. In all cases where land is built up by fill upon areas formerly under water, the use district and area regulations applying to the land immediately adjoining such built-up land shall be automatically extended thereto. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 2. - Zoning districts and intent. 
    For the purpose of classifying, regulating and restricting the location of trades and industries, and the location of buildings designed for industry, business, residence and other uses, the City of Melbourne is hereby divided into the following zoning districts, which implement the City of Melbourne Comprehensive Plan. The designation of use districts and uses by letter symbols as set forth herein, when used throughout this code and upon the zoning map shall have the same effect as if the full description of said district were stated. 
(A)  AEU - Agricultural Estate Use District. The AEU agricultural estate district encompasses lands devoted to agricultural pursuits and single-family residential development of spacious character. The AEU zoning district is intended to be similar to the Brevard County AU zoning district in rural areas. 
(B)  REU - Rural Estate Use District. The REU rural estate district encompasses lands devoted to single-family residential development of spacious character. The REU zoning district is intended to be similar to the Brevard County RR-1 zoning district in rural areas that are transitioning from rural to suburban use. 
(C)  R-1AAA, R-1AA, R-1A - Single-Family Low Density Residential Districts. The provisions of these districts are intended to apply to an area of single-family residential development. Lot sizes and other restrictions are intended to protect and promote high quality residential development. 
(D)  R-1B - Single-Family Low Density Residential District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area of single-family residential development with incentives on lot size for affordable housing projects. (See appendix B, article V, section 2, Table 2A, Footnote 6 and appendix B, article VI, section 1(B)). Lot sizes and other restrictions are intended to permit a flexibility of design and a variety of housing styles, promote affordable single-family housing, and encourage the preservation of natural features such as scrub habitat, unique hardwood canopies and wetlands. 
(E)  R-2 - One-, Two- and Multiple-Family Dwelling Medium Density District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area of low or medium density residential development with a variety of housing types. Lot sizes and other restrictions are intended to promote and protect low or medium density residential development, maintaining an adequate amount of open space for such development. Some nonresidential uses compatible with the character of the district are also permitted as conditional uses. 
(F)  R-3 - Multiple-Family Dwelling High Density District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area of low, medium, or high density residential development. Lot, height, and other building restrictions are intended to accommodate a variety of residential development, maintaining an adequate amount of open space for residential uses. Some nonresidential uses compatible with the character of the district or as accessory uses to serve high density residential are also allowed. 
(G)  R-4 - Two-Family Dwelling District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area to be developed solely for duplexes at a low or medium density. It is intended that this district accommodate a compatible development of residential use at a higher density than single-family use, but at no lower standard of quality. Internal design, attractiveness, order and efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate usable open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of good functional relationship both between dwellings and surrounding uses. 
(H)  R-A - Residential Holding District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to a sparsely developed area capable of supporting single-family residences at very low densities. This classification is also intended to place land in a holding pattern until such time that a specific development request is presented which is consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(I)  R-2T - Planned Residential Development for Mobile Home Parks. Mobile home parks developed in such a manner as to make efficient, economical and aesthetically pleasing use of the land, so restricted that same will be continually maintained by the owner, and when such is provided for in a carefully drawn plan, the city council may permit upon recommendation of the planning and zoning board such development providing the conditions contained in article V, section 2(G) of this code are met. 
(J)  PUD - Planned Unit Development District. The planned development is a concept which encourages mixed uses and unconventional development designs in those cases where the developer can demonstrate improved living environments, protection of natural resources or increased effectiveness of service delivery and the reduction of external trips. The purpose of a planned development is to encourage the development of large tracts of land as planned residential neighborhoods and communities that provide a more varied and interesting urban pattern and a full range of residence types as well as commercial uses designed to serve the inhabitants of the planned development. It is recognized that only through ingenuity, imagination and flexibility can residential developments be produced which are in keeping with the intent of this section while departing from the strict application of conventional use and dimension requirements of other zoning districts and subdivision regulations. 
The standards for planned unit developments contained in article V are intended to achieve the following objectives: 
(1)  Accumulation of large areas of usable open spaces for recreation and preservation of natural amenities. 
(2)  Flexibility in design to take the greatest advantage of natural land, trees, historical and other features. 
(3)  Creation of a variety of housing types and compatible neighborhood arrangements that give the home buyer greater choice in selecting types of environment and living units. 
(4)  Allowance of sufficient freedom for the developer to take a creative approach to the use of land and related physical development, as well as utilizing innovative techniques to enhance the visual character of the City of Melbourne. 
(5)  Efficient use of land that may result in smaller street and utility networks and reduce development costs. 
(6)  Establishment of criteria for the inclusion of compatible associated uses to complement the residential areas within the planned unit development. 
(7)  Simplification of approval procedures of proposed developments through simultaneous review by the city of proposed land use, site consideration, lot and setback consideration, public needs and requirements, and health and safety factors. 
(8)  Economical and efficient use of land, utilities and streets with resulting lower housing costs. 
(K)  R-P - Residential-Professional District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to a transition area between commercial and residential uses. Principal uses and restrictions of the district are intended to promote and protect low or medium density residential development in combination with low intensity commercial development to provide a buffer area between residential and nonresidential areas as well as to facilitate cohesive grouping of more intensely developed commercial activities with high traffic generating capabilities. 
(L)  C-1A - Professional, Offices and Services District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area adjacent to major streets and convenient and complementary to major commercial, industrial and/or transportation facilities. The types of uses permitted and other restrictions are intended to provide an amenable environment for the development of professional offices and services separate from the intensive development of commercial and industrial facilities. 
(M)  C-1 - Neighborhood Commercial District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area adjacent to arterial and major collector streets and convenient to major residential areas. The types of uses permitted are intended to serve consumer needs. Lot sizes and other restrictions are intended to reduce conflicts with adjacent residential uses and to minimize the interruption of traffic along thoroughfares. 
(N)  C-2 - General Commercial District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area intended to be developed and preserved as a major commercial center serving the commercial needs of the community and region as well as the motoring public. The types of uses and other restriction are intended to promote adequate protection from conflicts with adjacent residential and other noncommercial uses, and to minimize the interruption of traffic along adjacent thoroughfares. 
(O)  C-3 - Central Business District. This district is intended to apply to the central commercial, professional, financial, governmental and civic core of the city. Lot and building regulations are intended to permit intensive development of the area and to discourage uses not requiring a central location and which would create friction with performance of central functions. 
(P)  C-P - Commercial Parkway District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to areas located adjacent to a main highway. The types of uses permitted and restrictions are intended to serve the needs of the motorist and provide an amenable impression of the city. Large lot sizes and other restrictions are intended to minimize frequent ingress and egress to the highway from abutting uses, thereby allowing the thoroughfare to serve its primary function of carrying an uninterrupted flow of traffic. 
(Q)  M-1 - Light Industrial District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area located in close proximity to rail, air or major roadway facilities and which can serve intensive commercial uses and light manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, wholesaling and other industrial functions of the city and the region. Restrictions herein are intended to minimize adverse influences of the industrial activities on nearby non-industrial areas and to eliminate unnecessary industrial traffic through non-industrial areas. 
(R)  M-2 - General Industrial District. The provisions of this district are intended to apply to an area located in close proximity to rail, air and major roadway facilities and which can serve general manufacturing, storage, distribution and other general industrial functions of the city, state and region. Restrictions herein are intended to minimize adverse influence of the industrial activities on nearby non-industrial areas and to eliminate unnecessary industrial traffic through non-industrial areas. 
(S)  I-1 - Institutional District. The provisions applicable to this district are intended to apply to an area which can serve the needs of the community for public and semi-public facilities of an educational, recreational, health or cultural nature. Since the site and building requirements for such uses vary with the size and type of use, a review and approval of the plans is specified and the zoning itself is predicated upon the approval of the site plan. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005; Ord. No. 2009-31, § 2, 8-25-2009; Ord. No. 2010-14, § 3, 4-13-2010; Ord. No. 2017-31, § 2, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 3. - Consistency with the comprehensive plan. 
    This section is intended to correlate individual zoning classifications with land use districts. The following table shows which zoning districts implement the various land use categories. No real property shall be rezoned, and no amendment to this code shall be adopted, unless such action is consistent with the comprehensive plan of the city. The planning and zoning board shall include in its recommendation upon any rezoning application, and upon any ordinance amending the zoning code submitted to the board for review, a finding that the proposed action is or is not consistent with the city's comprehensive plan.

(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 1. - Exceptions and variations to height regulations. 
(A)  Exceptions. The height limitations contained in the schedule of district regulations do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas, water tanks, ventilators, chimneys, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy. 
(B)  Multi-story developments. Developments in the R-2, R-3, R-P, M-1, M-2, C-P, C-1A, C-1 and C-2 zoning districts that exceed one story in height, except for two-story single-family homes and two-family buildings, shall provide the following minimum building setbacks: 
Adjacent to: Building Height: Any single-family district 
or single-family, townhouse or 
two-family development 
in R-2, R-3, R-P 
and PUD districts Any multifamily district 
or developed multifamily 
in the R-P 
or PUD districts Right-of-Way Up to 35 feet 35 feet 25 feet 30 feet More than 35 feet to 50 feet 45 feet 30 feet 35 feet More than 50 feet to 65 feet 55 feet 35 feet 40 feet More than 65 feet to 80 feet 65 feet 40 feet 45 feet More than 80 feet 75 feet 45 feet 50 feet  
This regulation should not be misconstrued to represent that all tall buildings must utilize a "step" design; the setback on the lower floors could also be the same as the top floors without any "steps" (see graphic below). 

These standards may be modified for building heights approved through the conditional use process (see next section). 
(C)  Additional height through conditional use review. 
(1)  General. Should additional height be requested through the conditional use process as provided in Tables 2A and 2B, article V, section 2, the following standards, in addition to the conditional use review criteria, shall be considered: 
(a)  The proposed building shall: 
1.  Preserve scenic views. 
2.  Maintain character of adjacent single-family residential zoning districts. 
3.  Minimize blockage of breeze and light to adjacent properties and sidewalk area. 
(b)  The lot shall have a minimum size of 22,500 square feet. 
(c)  The lot width shall be at least 150 feet. 
(d)  Parking areas, including surface parking and structures, shall be screened with landscaping to minimize their visibility from adjacent streets. 
(e)  No shadow will be cast upon any solar energy panel for which a building permit has been requested or previously granted, and which is located upon any adjacent structure or property. 
(f)  Conditional use requests for additional building height shall be required to meet additional criteria related to the public benefit of the proposal. Specifically, conditional use requests to increase building height by up to 100 percent of the permitted height will require meeting additional breezeway and landscape requirements and/or other public benefits as deemed necessary by the city. Conditional use requests to increase building height by up to 100 percent of the permitted height will require meeting extraordinary public benefit requirements including breezeways and landscape. In addition, approval of height increases over 100 percent of the permitted height shall require a five-sevenths vote of the city council. 
(D)  Reserved. 
(E)  Melbourne International Airport area height overlay standards. 
(1)  General. The intent of this subsection is to preserve and enhance the unique features of the Melbourne International Airport by establishing a height overlay for the diverse aviation, industrial, and commercial uses within the area. Such standards will assist in the timeliness of development processing and permitting by the city for future economic development projects that require additional height, while also providing separation from adjacent single-family residential zoning. 
(2)  Applicability. This article will apply to development in parts of the Melbourne International Airport as more fully described in the table below (and as outlined on a map attached to Ordinance No. 2013-41 adopted July 9, 2013). The areas specified herein will continue to be subject to all non-height standards of development, as well as federal or local aviation height zone restrictions previously imposed. In addition, projects with conditional uses already approved for height will comply with the ordinance for each project's specific approval. 
Area Location Max Height Max # Stories A Airport owned property zoned M-1, located west of Airport Boulevard, west of north Apollo Boulevard, south of the L-7 drainage canal, east of Wickham Road, and north of NASA Boulevard. 96 ft. 8 B Airport owned property zoned M-1 or M-2, located west of north Apollo Boulevard, north of the L-7 drainage canal and immediately adjacent to St. Michael's Place. 60 ft. 5  
(3)  Height restriction setback. Structures exceeding 48 feet of height that are located within the overlay area and located adjacent to a single-family residential zoning district shall provide additional setbacks. 
Area A: 500-foot setback 
Area B: 300-foot setback 
However, other project-related improvements such as parking, stormwater, and other structures that do not exceed 48 feet of height may be located within the height restriction setback. 
(4)  Conditional use within height restriction setback. A request for additional height within the height restriction setback will require a conditional use approval, pursuant to appendix B, article IV, section 1(C) and appendix B, article IX, section 5. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005; Ord. No. 2007-92, § 1, 11-27-2007; Ord. No. 2009-31, § 3, 8-25-2009; Ord. No. 2010-37, § 4, 6-22-2010; Ord. No. 2013-41, § 1, 7-9-2013; Ord. No. 2015-32, § 1, 9-8-2015; Ord. No. 2016-04, § 1, 1-26-2016) 
Sec. 2. - Building setbacks. 
(A)  Measuring building setbacks. The setback requirements stated in this section shall be construed as a minimum setback and shall not be construed as repealing in any manner any existing requirement or zoning ordinance of the City of Melbourne. If there are conflicting setbacks, the most restrictive setback, i.e., the greatest setback, shall apply unless specifically stated otherwise. 
(B)  Setback encroachments. Every part of a required yard shall be open and unobstructed except as hereinafter provided or as otherwise permitted in this code. 
(1)  Sills or belt courses may not project over 18 inches into a required yard. 
(2)  Movable awnings may not project over five feet into a required yard, and where the yard is less than ten feet in width the projection shall not exceed more than one-half the depth of the yard. 
(3)  Chimneys, fireplaces, bay windows, or pilaster may not project over two feet into a required yard. 
(4)  Fire escapes, stairways, and balconies that are unroofed and unenclosed may not project over five feet into a required rear yard, or over three feet into a required side yard. 
(5)  Hoods, canopies, eaves or marquees may not project over four feet into a required yard. 
(6)  Fences, walls and hedges shall be permitted in required yards subject to the provisions established herein. 
(7)  On all building sites abutting upon a canal, waterway, river or other navigable stream, the minimum setback from the waterway for all buildings, or portions thereof, designed for residential or commercial purposes shall be 35 feet from the shoreline/mean high water line. 
(8)  Existing or new porch areas in the rear yard of single-family and duplex structures may be screened provided that the enclosed area does not extend more than 12 feet into the required rear yard and that the area of the enclosure does not exceed 240 square feet. 
(C)  Additional setback. See article IV, section 1 for additional setbacks required as a result of increased building height. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005; Ord. No. 2009-31, § 3, 8-25-2009; Ord. No. 2017-31, § 3, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 3. - Buildings and structures. 
(A)  Buildings required. All residential, commercial, industrial and institutional uses shall provide at least the minimum size building required for the district in which the use is to be located except where the use does not require a building such as vehicle storage, land excavation, land alteration/non-household waste landfill or agricultural uses. Said building shall contain plumbing facilities adequate to serve the needs of the customers and employees of the commercial, industrial or institutional uses. 
(B)  Erection of more than one principal structure on a lot. In any district, except AEU, REU, R-1AAA, R-1AA, R-1A and R-1B, more than one structure housing a permitted or permissible principal use may be erected on a single lot, provided that yard and other requirements of this code shall be met for each structure as though it were on an individual lot. The separation between structures shall not be less than required by the Fire Code, or ten feet, whichever is more. 
(C)  Structures to have access. Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street or with access to a city approved private street, and all structures shall be so located on lots as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection, and required off-street parking 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 4. - Density. 
(A)  Designation of lesser maximum density. Any person, firm or corporation owning an interest in real property that files an application for a change in land use classification to R-2, R-3 or other land use classification permitting multifamily dwellings may, at its option, request such change with a maximum density limitation of less than that permitted in that particular land use classification. Said request shall designate an exact lesser maximum density limitation in terms of a specified number of dwelling units per gross acre. Said request may be specified in the application for the change in land use classification or at any time prior to final action by the City Council of Melbourne on said application site plan approval. Upon final approval by the city council of a change in land use classification with a requested designation of a lesser maximum density limitation, such designation shall become a binding condition on the use of said land and the designation shall be noted on the Official Zoning Map of Melbourne. In such an event the maximum density specified in the specific district involved shall be rendered inapplicable to said land and the lesser maximum density limitation designation shall control. 
(B)  Density calculation. 
(1)  Adjacent to waterways, oceans, or lakes. In calculating gross acreage for parcels of land abutting waterways, oceans, or lakes, only that portion of the parcel lying upland of the mean or ordinary high water line of said parcel shall be included. 
(2)  Clustering. Density may be clustered on an overall development project as outlined in the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Within established subdivisions. In calculating gross acreage for parcels of land within a subdivision, the following acreage may be utilized to determine the total density: 
(a)  Subject property. Acreage of the subject property. 
(b)  Adjacent right-of-way. Half of the width of any immediately adjacent right-of-way, multiplied by the length of the right-of-way running parallel with the subject property. 
(c)  Portion of common infrastructure and property. A proportional share of any common infrastructure and property areas shown on the recorded subdivision plat, such as retention, open space, recreational facilities, common parking areas, conservation areas, and any other area used to calculate initial density during the subdivision process. 
(4)  Future Land Use categories. Dwelling unit density shall be additionally classified according to the following categories: 
(a)  Urban edge (one unit per 100 acres). This density allowance is intended to provide a clear separation between urban uses within a master planned community and nearby rural and conservation uses. 
(b)  Estate residential (zero to three units/acre). This density is intended as a transition between the remaining rural areas and the more intensely developed sites in the city. This density range accommodates detached single-family houses on larger lot sizes, and accessory agricultural uses. 
(c)  Low density residential (zero to six dwelling units/acre). This density is appropriate where urban services are provided in a neighborhood setting. This density range accommodates detached single-family homes, patio homes, zero lot line houses and other forms of detached or semi-detached homes. 
(d)  Medium density residential (over six to 15 dwelling units/acre). This density is intended to provide a buffer between low-density residential uses and more intense uses such as high density residential or commercial. It is also suitable at major intersections when adequate buffering from the highways can be provided. Low-density residential uses may be permitted in these use areas. 
(e)  High density residential (over 15 to 30 dwelling units/acre). This density is intended for areas close to major intersections and commercial areas where a slightly higher amount of residential trips can be allowed due to proximity to shopping and major roads. Apartments, high-rise residential structures and other intense housing product types are typical uses, although low and medium density residential uses may also be permitted. 
(f)  General commercial (up to 15 units per acre). This density is intended to permit the consideration of limited medium density residential uses along major transportation corridors as part of mixed use developments. 
(g)  Mixed use (varies per location). 
Downtown Melbourne Activity Center (DMAC)-Up to 100 units per acre. 
Eau Gallie Activity Center (EGAC)-Up to 50 units per acre. 
Midtown Activity Center (MAC)-Up to 30 units per acre. 
Community Activity Center (CAC)-Up to 30 units per acre. 
Outside an activity center-Up to 15 units per acre. 
This density is intended to encourage mixed use urban development within designated activity center overlays and along major transportation corridors. Higher residential densities are permitted in the urban core areas of the city while lower residential densities are allowed outside of the urban centers. 
(h)  Office/Professional (varies per location). 
Inside an activity center-Up to 15 units per space. 
Outside an activity center-Up to ten units per space. 
This density is intended to permit the consideration of limited low density and medium density residential uses in areas where such development can be utilized as a buffer between lower intensity residential uses and higher intensity commercial uses. 
(C)  Transfer of development rights (TDR) for properties. 
(1)  Purpose . This section provides a means to transfer development rights regarding density or intensity from eligible sending sites to eligible receiving sites through a voluntary process that permanently preserves the natural environment of uplands along the Indian River Lagoon that provide a public benefit. The intent of this section is to: 
(a)  Recognize there are coastal wetlands in the city that warrant protection. 
(b)  Offer an incentive-based alternative to development of coastal wetlands by allowing development rights to be transferred to the adjacent upland areas suitable for development. 
(c)  Direct development at the future land use densities established on the future land use map, from coastal wetlands to the upland portion of the site, consistent with Comprehensive Plan policy 1.1.15. 
(d)  Provide a mechanism by which the city can obtain the rights to protect the coastal wetlands for conservation uses. 
(e)  Recognize that that the conservation element of the Comprehensive Plan supports conservation uses along the Indian River Lagoon. 
(2)  Applicability . The sending and receiving sites for the transfer of development rights shall be located north of Carolin Street and south of Laurie Street, having land on both sides of U.S. Highway 1 and abutting the Indian River Lagoon. The sending site means the area located east of U.S. 1 and abutting the Indian River Lagoon. The receiving site means the area located west of U.S. 1 and abutting U.S. 1. 
(3)  [Subject to approval.] The transfer of development rights from the sending site to the receiving site shall be subject to city council approval by resolution. 
(4)  Evidence of transfer of development rights . The certificate of transfer of development rights shall document the development rights that have been removed from the sending site and transferred to the receiving site and shall be executed by the community development director and the then-current property owners of the sending site and the receiving site. The certificate of transfer of development rights shall be recorded in the public records. The certificate of transfer of development shall be valid for transfer purposes only. 
(5)  Calculations . The acreage for development rights that a sending site is eligible to send to a receiving site shall be determined by applying the sending site's available acreage for purposes of establishing density and/or intensity pursuant to this Code to the area of the sending site. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005; Ord. No. 2010-37, § 4, 6-22-2010; Ord. No. 2015-35, § 1, 8-25-2015; Ord. No. 2015-51, § 1, 11-24-2015) 
Sec. 5. - Intensity/floor area ratio (FAR). 
    Intensity calculation/floor area ratio (FAR). In calculating a development's FAR, the assigned FAR shall not include such features as parking lots or structures, aerial pedestrian crossovers, open or partially enclosed plazas, or exterior pedestrian and vehicular circulation areas. Maximum allowable FARs shall be classified according to the following future land use map categories: 
(1) Office/professional 0.7 FAR (2) General commercial (varies per location): Downtown Melbourne Activity Center (DMAC) 6 FAR Eau Gallie Activity Center (EGAC) 3 FAR Midtown Activity Center (MAC) 2 FAR Community Activity Center (CAC) 2 FAR Outside an activity center 0.7 FAR (3) Heavy commercial 0.7 FAR (4) Mixed use (varies per location): Downtown Melbourne Activity Center (DMAC) 6 FAR Eau Gallie Activity Center (EGAC) 3 FAR Midtown Activity Center (MAC) 2 FAR Community Activity Center (CAC) 2 FAR Outside an Activity Center 1 FAR (5) Industrial 1 FAR (6) Public/institutional (varies per location): Downtown Melbourne Activity Center (DMAC) 6 FAR Eau Gallie Activity Center (EGAC) 3 FAR Midtown Activity Center (MAC) 2 FAR Community Activity Center (CAC) 2 FAR Outside an Activity Center 0.5 FAR (7) Recreational (varies per location): Downtown Melbourne Activity Center (DMAC) 1 FAR Eau Gallie Activity Center (EGAC) 1 FAR Midtown Activity Center (MAC) 0.5 FAR Community Activity Center (CAC) 0.5 FAR Outside an Activity Center 0.5 FAR (8) Urban edge 0.5 FAR (9) Low, medium and high density residential - supportive community uses 0.5 FAR  
(Ord. No. 2010-37, § 4, 6-22-2010) 
Sec. 6. - Breezeways. 
    Breezeway requirements for waterfront properties: (Indian River Lagoon and Atlantic Ocean). Development sites (not including single-family detached residential lots) abutting waterways and located within a C-1, C-2, C-P, R-2, or R-3 zoning district shall be designed to maximize the preservation of views and breezes. All development within these areas shall comply with the standards contained in this section, in addition to the conditional use criteria, contained in appendix B, article IX, section 5 of the zoning code, for those uses that require conditional use review. 
    New multi-story developments, as applicable above, fronting on waterways, shall include a breezeway. For the purpose of this section, a breezeway shall consist of one or more open space areas, unoccupied and unobstructed by any portion of a building, structure, fence or sign over four feet in height, except for the projections of uncovered steps, uncovered balconies or uncovered porches, being the minimum horizontal distance between the side of a building or structure and the adjacent side property line or between the adjacent sides of two buildings on the same parcel or project area, extending from the street right-of-way line to the rear property line. A breezeway may include required building setbacks, buffer areas, landscape areas, surface parking lots, driveways, vehicular use areas, stormwater retention areas, swimming pools, pool decks and uncovered patios.

(3)   Not allowed adjacent to single-family districts. 
(Ord. No. 2010-37, § 4, 6-22-2010) 
Sec. 7. - Aggregation of parcels. 
    Two or more parcels of land in close proximity to one another shall be aggregated and treated as a single lot under the zoning code and land development regulations when the parcels of land are determined to be unified by ownership and determined to be part of a unified use or plan of development. The following criteria shall be considered in order for the community development director to determine whether there is unified ownership and a unified use or plan of development: 
(1)  Unity of ownership shall occur when one of the following factors is present: 
(a)  The same person or entity has retained or shared control of the parcels or the development; or 
(b)  The same person or entity has ownership or a significant legal or equitable interest in the parcels or the development; or 
(c)  There is common management of the parcels or the development. 
(2)  Unity of use or plan of development. No one factor listed below shall be determinative of the existence of a unity of use, nor is it necessary for all of the following factors to indicate a unity of use: 
(a)  Intent of the owner or developers, to unify the parcels, as evidenced through word and action; and 
(b)  Adaptability of property to unified use or plan of development; and 
(c)  Interdependence of the parcels; and 
(d)  Highest and best use of property; and 
(e)  Appearance of the land; and 
(f)  Actual or proposed use of the land; and 
(g)  Possibility of parcels being combined in use in reasonably near future; and 
(h)  Interconnection, interdependence, or relationship of the infrastructure serving the parcels of land. 
(3)  The following activities shall not be considered in determining whether to aggregate two or more parcels of land: 
(a)  The sale of unimproved parcels of land, where the seller does not retain significant control of the future development of the parcels, shall not affect this determination. 
(b)  The fact that the same lender has a financial interest, including one acquired through foreclosure, in two or more parcels, so long as the lender is not an active participant in the planning, management, or development of the parcels in which it has an interest, shall not affect this determination. 
(c)  The existence of multiple zoning districts on the lot shall not affect this determination. 
(d)  The existence of multiple tax parcels on the lot shall not affect this determination. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to aggregate two or more parcels, the parcels of land in a development must be in close proximity to one another. Close proximity shall mean that two parcels of land in a development are within 500 feet of each other. Measurement of the distance between two parcels of land in a development shall be by the straight-line method of measurement, meaning that by drawing a straight line between the nearest part of any of the boundaries of both parcels, said boundaries are within 500 feet of each other. Remote parking lots must comply with the code requirements for off-site, off-street parking (per appendix D, chapter 9, article V, section 9.75). 
(Ord. No. 2010-13, § 2, 9-7-2010) 
ARTICLE V. - DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
    No building shall be erected, nor shall buildings or premises be used for any purpose other than a purpose permitted by this code in the use district in which such building or premises is or are located. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 

Sec. 1. - Application of district regulations. 
    Unless the context expressly indicates the contrary, the regulations set by this code within each district in this article shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, except as hereinafter provided: 
(1)  No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located. 
(2)  No building, structure or premises shall be erected, altered or used so as to produce greater height, smaller yards or less unoccupied area, and no building shall be occupied by more families than prescribed for such building, structure or premises for the district in which it is located. 
(3)  No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space required in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this code, shall be included as part of a yard, open space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building. 
(4)  No yard or lot existing at the time of adoption of this code shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this code shall meet the minimum requirements established by this code. 
(5)  Every building or structure hereafter erected shall be located on a lot as defined herein. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street, or with access to a public street. 
(6)  A lot with multiple zoning designations . When a lot includes two or more parcels reflecting different zoning districts, the applicable zoning regulations of this zoning code shall be applied to the area within each respective zoning district. Each use must comply with its underlying zoning district. Additionally, no accessory use shall be located on any portion of the lot unless the principal use is a permitted use, as established in Tables 1A and 2A, section 2(D), article V of the zoning code, in the zoning district underlying the accessory use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as set forth in chapter 50, Stormwater Regulations, and appendix D, chapter 9, article V, parking and loading, City Code, parking and stormwater as accessory facilities may be located on any portion of the lot, provided that the principal use is a permitted use (P) on any portion of the lot and the principal use does not require conditional use (C) approval per Tables 1A and 2A, section 2(D), article V, of the zoning code. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005; Ord. No. 2010-13, § 3, 9-7-2010; Ord. No. 2017-31, § 4, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 2. - District use and dimensional standards. 
    This section defines and prescribes the specific uses allowed within each zoning district identified in this code, as well as specific standards required to develop within each zoning district and a methodology for uses not specifically listed. In addition, this section contains the use standards for the rural zoning districts, and the use and dimensional standards for planned developments. 
(A)  Uses not specifically listed. In the event that a particular use is not listed anywhere in this chapter and that no listed use describes the land use activity in question and that such use is not determined to be an accessory use, then it shall be considered the same as the use having the most similar characteristics. An unlisted use shall be determined to be a permitted use, prohibited, or conditional use based on the similarities to other uses listed or defined elsewhere in this chapter. 
(B)  Criteria for reviewing uses not listed. Upon application for a use not herein listed, the community development director shall determine whether or not the use shall be allowed in the specific zoning district and whether it shall be listed as a permitted use, a permitted use with conditions or a conditional use. 
The basis for reviewing unlisted uses shall be the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), which shall be used to determine the general classification of uses. Other factors which may be considered shall be traffic generation volume, type of traffic attracted to and generated by the site, parking requirements, compatibility to surrounding land uses, noise, lighting and visual impacts, hours of operation, and intensity of use. The community development director, or designee, may after review of the criteria herein set forth determine that certain uses are prohibited uses and shall not be allowed in any zoning district. In the event that any use is determined to be a prohibited use, record of the reasons given for that decision shall be kept on file and shall be used as guidelines for subsequent use determinations. 
(C)  Appeals of decisions on unlisted uses. Such decisions may be appealed to the planning and zoning board in conformance with the provisions of part II, chapter 2, article IV, boards and committees. 
(D)  Use and dimensional standards tables. Tables 1A and 1B contain a list of uses allowed in each district and specify whether they are permitted by right (P) or if they require conditional use approval (CU). Tables 2A and 2B contain the dimensional standards for the various uses allowed in each district.

  Provision of opaque buffering or screening to protect the privacy and amenities of the adjacent existing uses. 
No buildings, parking lots or other structures may be located within the perimeter setback area. However, swimming pools and pool decks may be permitted subject to the normal residential setback requirements. The buffer area may be included in the calculation for the required open space, if the area is intended for common use and not fenced for the private use of the adjacent residential unit. 
(e)  Minimum lot size, lot width, lot depth, and setbacks. There shall be no pre-determined minimum lot size, lot width, lot depth, or building setbacks required within a PUD district. The criteria for establishing these standards include existing zoning, character of existing and future developments adjacent to the PUD, site characteristics, and the intended character of the development. The general location of proposed structures and proposed setbacks shall be shown on the development plan and the standards shall be stated on the developers' agreement. Properties bordering the ocean must meet the department of environmental protection setback requirements.

(1)  Size: Portable storage units shall not exceed eight feet in height, eight feet in width, and 16 feet in length. 
(2)  Number of units: One portable storage unit may be located on any lot occupied by a single-family dwelling. The number of permitted portable storage units for all other uses shall be based on one unit per each 10,000 square feet of building area, or portion thereof. 
(3)  Location: 
(a)  Within residential districts, portable storage units may be located in a required setback; however, they shall not be located in such a manner to impair a motor vehicle operator's view of other motor vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians upon entering or exiting rights-of-way. In all other districts, the unit shall not be located in any required landscape, buffer or parking area. 
(b)  Portable storage units shall not be located in such a manner to obstruct the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
(4)  Wind loads: If the National Weather Advisory Service or other qualified weather advisory service identifies weather conditions which are predicted to include winds of 75 mph or greater, all portable storage units shall be removed from all properties and placed in approved storage locations at least 24 hours prior to the predicted onset of such winds or as soon as reasonably practical if less notice is provided. This requirement may be modified by the building official upon receipt of adequate documentation from a registered architect or engineer or other professional qualified to give such opinion that a greater wind loading pertain to a particular portable storage unit model or manufacturer so that the portable storage unit is unlikely to be moved by winds greater than the predicted winds. As an alternative to removal, the portable storage vendor may submit a tie down proposal for approval by the building official and each portable storage unit not removed shall be tied down in the approved manner. 
(5)  Time frame: 
(a)  Portable storage units are allowed in residential districts for a period not exceeding 14 days and no more than two times a year on residentially zoned property. For nonresidentially zoned property, portable storage units are allowed for a period not to exceed 30 days and no more than two times a year.

(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS AND STRUCTURES 

Sec. 1. - Intent. 
    Within the zoning districts established by this code, there may exist lots, structures, or uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before this code was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this code or future amendments. It is the intent of this code to permit these nonconformities to continue in their present condition until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuation. Such uses are declared by this code to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this code that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 2. - Types of nonconformity. 
(A)  Nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this code, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single platted lot of record. Such lot must be in separate ownership from adjacent lots and not of continuous frontage with another lot in the same ownership as of the effective date of this code, or amendment hereto, at which time standards for lot area or width were set, continuously until the date that a building permit is issued. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for lot area or lot width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving lot area or lot width, or both, shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of area, width, or yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of adjustment. 
Single-family homes may be constructed on any substandard, vacant platted lot of record, platted prior to November 1983, as long as density on the affected platted lot does not exceed the land use density designated on the future land use map by more than 25 percent. Platted lots designated as mixed use or general commercial on the future land use map, shall be considered to allow a density of 15 dwelling units per acre for the purposes of this section. In addition, all other requirements set forth in this Comprehensive Plan or in the city's land development code, including, but not limited to, lot coverage and yard requirements must be met, unless as permitted by the land development code, or if a variance is granted by the zoning board of adjustment. 
(B)  Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this code as enacted or amended. Such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code; unless such use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such use is located. 
(2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code. 
(3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 90 consecutive days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this code for the district in which such land is located regardless of whether or not a property is licensed for business. In determining that a nonconforming use of land has ceased for 90 consecutive days, it shall not be necessary to prove or ascertain that there has been an intent to abandon the use on the part of a property owner, lessee or occupant. 
(4)  Additional structures that do not conform to the requirements of this code shall be prohibited in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
(5)  Subdivisions and lots developed in the R-1B zoning districts, approved or platted before March 11, 2003, where density exceeds four units per gross acre, shall not be deemed/considered to be a nonconforming platted subdivision. 
(C)  Nonconforming structures and site improvements. Where a lawful structure or associated site improvements exist at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code that could not be built under the terms of this code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or by other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure or improvements may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity. 
(2)  Any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(3)  Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this code. 
(4)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(5)  If any nonresidential principal structure or premises remains unoccupied for a period of 90 consecutive days, any subsequent use of the principal structure shall conform to the parking and landscaping regulations of the district in which it is located regardless of whether or not the property is licensed for business. In determining that a nonconforming use of land has ceased for 90 consecutive days, it shall not be necessary to prove or ascertain that there has been an intent to abandon the use on the part of a property owner, lessee or occupant, or that the characteristic equipment or furnishings have been removed from the structure. 
(6)  Existing single-family, duplex, or triplex units not having a garage shall not be considered to be nonconforming structures. Existing carports and/or garages constructed prior to 1984 may be enclosed and become part of the dwelling unit as long as the enclosure will not violate any other provision of this code and the proper permits are obtained. 
(7)  Subdivisions constructed between 1991 and 1997 utilizing the concept of a detached townhouses in the R-2 zoning district shall not be considered to be nonconforming. Additional development on these lots shall meet the setbacks already in existence in that subdivision. In no event shall there be less than ten feet between primary structures unless a variance has been granted by the board of adjustment. 
(8)  Nonconforming signs shall be governed by appendix D, chapter 11, section 11.07. 
(D)  Combinations. If a lawful use involving individual structures or site improvements, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
(2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this code but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(3)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structures are located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(4)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this code is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction. 
(5)  If any nonresidential principal structure remains unoccupied for a period of 90 consecutive days, any subsequent use of the structure shall conform to the parking and landscaping regulations of the district in which it is located regardless of whether or not the property is licensed for business. In determining that a nonconforming use of land has ceased for 90 consecutive days, it shall not be necessary to prove or ascertain that there has been an intent to abandon the use on the part of a property owner, lessee or occupant. 
As used in this subparagraph, the term "unoccupied" means lack of active use. In determining that a principal structure is unoccupied for 90 consecutive days, it shall not be necessary to prove or ascertain that there has been an intent to abandon the use or occupancy of the structure by the property owner, tenant, or occupant, or that the characteristic equipment or furnishings have been removed from the structure. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005; Ord. No. 2006-79, § 9, 8-8-2006; Ord. No. 2010-37, § 7, 6-22-2010; Ord. No. 2017-40, § 1, 9-20-2017) 
Sec. 3. - Modifications to nonconforming uses and structures. 
(A)  Extension and enlargement. Nonconforming structures, site improvements, and/or a nonconforming use of land, shall not be extended or enlarged after adoption of this code by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this code shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved. In no event shall the time of such construction exceed a period of one year except for a demonstrated cause approved by city council. 
(B)  Repairs and maintenance. On any land devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, structure or combination thereof, ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be done provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this code shall not be increased. Nothing in this code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(C)  Variances. Establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or uses in an adjoining zoning district. Under no circumstances shall the board of adjustment grant a variance to permit a use not generally permitted in the zoning district involved, or any use expressly or by implication, prohibited by the terms of the code in the zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 4. - Temporary uses. 
    The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or structures shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use. Such use shall not be validated by the adoption of this code unless it complies with the terms of this code. 
    Any house of worship which has used any structure on the premises of its sanctuary as a temporary overnight shelter for the homeless during the calendar years 1988, 1989, 1990 or 1991, may continue to utilize its premises periodically for a temporary overnight shelter for the homeless without violating this code or being declared to be a nonconforming use. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 5. - Classification. 
    Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer an area from one district to another district of a different classification, the foregoing provision shall also apply to any nonconforming uses existing therein. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
Sec. 6. - Condemnation. 
    In the event that the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), Brevard County, the City of Melbourne or any other governmental agency with the power of condemnation condemns private property to acquire road right-of-way, and the condemnation results in the elimination or decrease of the required perimeter landscaping, results in insufficient yard requirements (setbacks), or results in a parcel that does not meet the minimum lot size, such private property shall become nonconforming and may continue as long as it remains otherwise lawful. 
(Ord. No. 2005-120, § 2, 11-8-2005) 
ARTICLE IX. - ZONING APPLICATIONS AND PROCEDURES 

Sec. 1. - Zoning code; map amendments. 
    The city council may from time to time on its own motion, or on petition, or on recommendation of the planning and zoning board or any department or agency of the city, amend, supplement, or repeal the regulations and provisions of this ordinance. 
(A)  Application. 
(1)  An amendment or rezoning may be initiated by a petition of property owners or authorized agents of such owners for rezoning of any land to a less restricted district provided that said land is adjacent to or directly across the street or alley from property which is already zoned in the same or a less restricted zone as that to which said property is proposed to be rezoned. 
(2)  Every such proposed amendment or change, whether initiated by the city council or by petition, shall be referred to the planning and zoning board who shall study such proposals to determine: 
(a)  The need and justification for the change. 
(b)  When pertaining to the rezoning of land, the affect of the change, if any, on a particular property and on surrounding properties. 
(c)  When pertaining to the rezoning of land, the amount of undeveloped land in the general area and in the city having the same classification as that requested. 
(d)  The relationship of the proposed amendment to the purpose of the city's plan for development with appropriate consideration as to whether the proposed change will further the purposes of this ordinance and the plan. 
(B)  Planning and zoning board action. No recommendation for change or amendment may be considered until after a public hearing by the planning and zoning board, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. 
The planning and zoning board, after conducting the public hearing as hereinabove provided, shall submit the request for change or amendment to the city council together with its written recommendations for approval or denial. The recommendations for affordable housing projects will go to city council with the initial public hearing held simultaneously with the first reading of an accompanying rezoning ordinance. 
(C)  Limitations. 
(1)  A proposal for rezoning or amendment to the official zoning map affecting a particular property or properties may contain conditions, limitations, or requirements not applicable to all other property in the zoning district to which the particular property is proposed to be rezoned. 
(2)  Unless a parcel of land has at least 40,000 square feet of land area, no amendment shall be enacted to change the zoning classification except to the existing zoning classification of property adjoining said parcel. Notwithstanding the foregoing size limitation, a less intensive zoning may be recommended by the community development director, the planning and zoning board (local planning agency) or city council, subject to consistency with the comprehensive plan, greater compatibility with the surrounding area, and other site specific issues deemed appropriate. 
(3)  Whenever any application for a change of zoning has been finally determined, no other or further application for a change of zoning for the same property, will be considered for a period of six months following the date of such action. Should conditions affecting such property materially change, in the opinion of the city council, or should a modified plan for a rezoning be presented to the city council, any of which, in the opinion of the city council, would justify action before the expiration of such six-month period, the city council, by a five-sevenths majority, may permit the filing of such application for a rezoning, notwithstanding the provisions of this section. 
(D)  Protest by property owners. In case of a protest against a proposed change of zoning signed by the owners of 20 percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed change, or of those extending 500 feet in any direction shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of six-sevenths of the city council. All written protests must be filed within 21 days following the date of the public hearing before the planning and zoning board. After submission to the city of the petition and the supporting signatures, no additional signatures may be added as supporting the petition. Once the petition and the supporting signatures have been filed with the city, any person who has signed the petition may remove his or her signature from the petition; provided, however, that to remove a signature supporting the petition, the individual must write to the city community development department prior to the city council meeting to request the removal of his or her signature from the petition. Signatures may only be removed prior to the vote on second reading of a rezoning ordinance. However, intent to file such a petition must be presented in writing to the city community development department by an individual or individuals residing within 500 feet of the proposed change within seven days following the hearing before the planning and zoning board. If no intent is filed, action may be taken by the city council at its next regular meeting. No zoning application may be changed or revised after the public hearing.

(5)  Land development regulation means an ordinance that has an adverse and material effect upon the applicant's claim to a vested right to commence and construct a specific type, level, nature, density, or intensity of development and which said ordinance is for the regulation of any aspect of development, including any city comprehensive planning, zoning, rezoning, subdivision, building construction, site planning, sign regulation, or any other regulations controlling the development of land. 
(6)  Parcel of land means any quantity of land capable of being described with such definiteness that its locations and boundaries may be established, which is designated by its owner as land to be used, or developed, as a unit or which has been developed as a unit. 
(7)  Pending means the date on which a proposed change in the city comprehensive plan or a land development regulation became pending. For a comprehensive plan or a land development regulation to be pending, it does not have to be before the city council, provided the appropriate administrative department of the city is actively pursuing it. Mere thoughts or comments by city employees concerning the desirability of a change are not enough to make the provision pending. There must be active and documented efforts on the part of those authorized to do the work which, in the normal course of city actions, culminates in the comprehensive plan or land development regulation adoption or amendment. The city council or local planning agency must at least be aware that these efforts are going forward. For a comprehensive plan or land development regulation to be pending, however, it is not essential that the property owners be advised of these activities. If the pending change in the comprehensive plan or a land development regulation is immediately preceded by a period in which a building, zoning or other moratoria, stop-gap or interim land development regulation existed which limited the ability of the applicant or the applicant's predecessor in interest to request changes in the pre-existing land development regulation, then the date on which the provision in the comprehensive plan or a land development regulation defeating the applicant's vested right shall be the date on which the proposed predecessor moratorium, stop-gap or interim land development regulation became pending. 
(Code 1984, § 10-122; Ord. No. 88-53, § 1, 12-13-1988; Ord. No. 2001-11, § 1, 2-27-2001) 
Sec. 1.33. - Vested rights special permit. 
(a)  Application for vested rights special permit. Upon application and review, the city council may grant, as a special permit, an exception to the otherwise applicable provisions of the city comprehensive plan or any land development regulations in the city code, except for transportation impact fees pursuant to chapter 10, appendix D, Melbourne City Code and the provision of mobility improvements pursuant to chapter 3, appendix D, Melbourne City Code. Said special permit shall specify the specific type, density, or intensity of development of a specifically described parcel of land or to any other person or legal entity. However, additional special permits may be issued to other persons or legal entities satisfying the requirements of this article. The special permit may be granted whenever the city council finds that the applicant has demonstrated that the applicant has a pre-existing vested right to commence or complete construction on a specific development. The special permit may be granted with or without conditions depending upon presented evidence. 
(b)  Considerations for determination of vested rights. In determining whether a right to commence or complete construction of a specific type, density, or intensity of development has vested the following factors, as the evidence shall deem to be appropriate, shall be considered: 
(1)  Whether there has been an act or omission to act by the city which would give rise to a vested right, the date of such act or omission, and the official position of the person responsible for the act or omission. 
(2)  With reference to the act or omission to act referenced in subsection (b)(1) above, whether the city official acted or omitted to act within the course and scope of his personnel rank job duties, and official position. 
(3)  Whether the applicant made a substantial change in position or has an investment-backed expectation, based upon an unexpired act, or omission to act, of the city including: 
a.  The nature of the applicant's change in position or investment-backed expectation. 
b.  Expenditure of money or obligation to expend funds. 
c.  The amount of funds spent or obligated. 
d.  Dates of expenditures or incurrence of the obligation, acts committed which represent a change in position, and dates thereof. 
(4)  Good faith of the applicant in substantially changing its position, or the incurring of extensive obligations and expenses based upon the city's actions or omissions to act. 
(5)  Any acts of the applicant (and the dates thereof) associated with physical improvements on the parcel of land in question such as grading, installation of utility infrastructure or public improvements, or any acts of the applicant (and the dates thereof), including dedication of land to the city or any other governmental entity, payment of fees such as, but not limited to, impact fees, design fees of specific buildings, and design fees for improvements to be constructed on the site. 
(6)  The extent to which the applicant has secured building permits for, and commenced or completed, the construction of subdivision improvements and buildings upon part but not all of the development project that was contemplated to extend over a period of months or years. 
(7)  Whether the applicant prior to or on the date of the change in the comprehensive plan or land development regulation defeating the applicant's vested right became pending has made contractual commitments to complete structures or deliver title thereto or occupancy thereof and the dates of and amounts of money involved in said commitment. 
(8)  Whether prior to the date the comprehensive plan or land development regulation became pending, the applicant incurred financial obligations to a lending institution which the applicant will be unable to meet, and whether it would be inequitable and unjust to require the applicant to meet the new regulations, and therefore should be permitted to proceed with the previously permitted type, density, or intensity of development. 
(9)  Whether enforcement of the terms of the currently effective comprehensive plan or any land development regulation, claimed to defeat the applicant's right to develop a parcel of land will expose the applicant to substantial monetary liability to third persons, or will leave the applicant completely unable, after thorough review of alternative solutions, to earn a reasonable return on his investment in the parcel of land. 
(10)  Whether the applicant has a vested right to commence and complete only a portion of a proposed development on all or a portion of the applicant's parcel of land. 
(11)  That the applicant owned an interest in the parcel of land proposed to be developed on the date of the change in the comprehensive plan or land development regulation and that the specific type, density, or intensity of development proposed for the parcel of land was lawful and permitted at that time. 
(12)  Whether the applicant has continuously owned the parcel of land since the date of the change in the comprehensive plan or land development regulation until the date of the public hearing before the city council on the special permit application. 
(13)  Whether requiring that the applicant's parcel of land be developed in accordance with the currently effective city comprehensive plan or city land development regulation restrictions will deprive the applicant of a reasonable rate of return on his investment or substantial change in position, or otherwise unjustly deprive the applicant of its vested rights. In determining the reasonableness of the projected rate of return, the following categories of expenditures shall not be included in the calculation of the applicant's investment: 
a.  Expenditures for professional services that are unrelated to the design or construction of the improvements proposed for the type, density, or intensity of development claimed by the applicant to be vested. 
b.  Expenditures for taxes, except for any increases in tax expenditures which result from issuance of development order which would now be contrary to the currently existing city comprehensive plan or relevant land development regulation. 
c.  Expenditures which the applicant has allocated to the particular proposed development but which the applicant would have been obligated to incur as an ordinary and necessary business expense (for example, employees salaries, equipment rental, chattel mortgage payments) had the plan for the particular development not been formulated or a development order not been issued, for the type, density, or intensity of development now claimed by the applicant to be vested. 
(14)  Any other information relevant to discerning the applicant's claim to vested rights to develop its parcel of land in a particular manner that may be pertinent under Florida or federal law, including the existence of an imminent peril to the public health, safety, welfare, economic property, general order, aesthetics, or appearance which should preclude approval of a vested rights special permit. 
(c)  Vested rights. The right of the applicant to commence or complete construction of development of a type, density, or intensity of development, on the applicant's parcel of land, or a portion thereof, is vested, if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city by substantial, competent evidence that: 
(1)  The currently effective city comprehensive plan or portion thereof, or a land development regulation, has a material and adverse effect upon the applicant's vested right to develop the subject parcel of land. 
(2)  By application of the considerations set out in subsection (b) hereof the applicant in good faith upon some act or omission of the city has made such a substantial change in position or has an investment-backed expectation that would make it inequitable and unjust to destroy the right of the applicant to commence or complete a certain type, density, or intensity of development upon all or a portion of the applicant's parcel of land. 
(3)  The fact that the parcel of land has been or is in a particular zoning or comprehensive planning land use district or classification under the currently effective, or any prior, city comprehensive plan or land development regulation, shall not, in and of itself, establish that an applicant's right to commence or complete construction of a certain type, density, or intensity of development has vested. If it is determined that there is an imminent peril to the public health, safety, welfare, general order, economic prosperity, aesthetics, or appearance or that the public cost outweighs the applicant's vested right, the special permit may be denied. 
(d)  Application. 
(1)  Any applicant may file an application for a special permit determining that the applicant's right to commence or complete a specific type, density, or intensity of development on a parcel of land has vested. Such application shall be filed with the city community development director and shall contain: 
a.  A concise and complete recital of the facts, including dates of expenditures or obligation to expend funds, dollar amounts, the nature of expenditures or obligation to expend funds, and other factors which are claimed to support the claim to a vested right to commence or complete a specific type, density, or intensity of development. 
b.  A legal description of the parcel of land and survey thereof upon which the applicant claims to have vested development rights. 
c.  The applicant's name, address, and telephone number. 
d.  The name, address and telephone number of any attorney or agent who is or will be representing the applicant. 
e.  A title opinion of a Florida attorney (which opinion is in a form acceptable to and in favor of the city), abstract of title, or other evidence demonstrating that the applicant has continuously held title to the parcel of land described in the application from the date on which the comprehensive plan or land development regulation change became pending until at least two weeks prior to the date of application for a special permit together with a description of the extent and quality of ownership of the parcel of land during said period. As of the date of final approval of any vested rights special permit, the applicant may be required by the city to update the foregoing information to the date of approval of any vested rights special permit. 
f.  An affidavit under penalty of perjury verified, or executed before a notary public (and thereafter subscribed to by said notary public), by the applicant attesting to the truth, accuracy and veracity of the application and all attachments thereto. 
g.  Such other information relevant to the standards and factors in this article as the community development director may specify. 
(2)  The applicant shall attach to the application original or photographically reproduced copies of all documents or other relevant evidence. Said attachments shall be deemed to be a part of the application. 
(3)  Application fee. No fee shall be required to file an application for vested rights. 
(e)  Local planning agency review. A public hearing shall be held by the local planning agency on the application for a special permit for vested rights determination. Within 45 days after the public hearing, the local planning agency shall forward its written findings and recommendations to the city manager. A copy of the findings and recommendations shall also be mailed to the applicant. Said findings of fact and recommendation shall be advisory in nature. 
(f)  City council review. Within 30 days of the date, the local planning agency has forwarded its findings of fact and recommendations with the city manager, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the application for a special permit. Within 45 days after the public hearing on the application for the special permit, the city council shall vote on the vested rights request and shall file its written findings and order of determination of the existence or nonexistence of vested rights with the city clerk. A copy will be forwarded to the community development director, and the applicant. The order shall either issue a special permit, issue the special permit with conditions, or deny the special permit application. 
(g)  Application deadline. A person or legal entity shall have one year after the effective date of a provision in the comprehensive plan or a land development regulation that defeats said person's or legal entity's vested right to file an application for vested rights. Failure to make such application shall be interpreted as waiver of a vested development right, as well as a waiver to any right to claim that the aforementioned provision in the comprehensive plan or land development regulation defeats or otherwise improperly operates counter to said person's or legal entity's vested development right. 
Although the one-year time period may, in the opinion of the aggrieved person or legal entity, have passed, any person or legal entity who believes that its vested rights may be abrogated by any provision in the comprehensive plan or by a land development regulation must, prior to seeking judicial relief, first file a complete application for a vested rights permit so that a determination can be made whether the one-year application deadline has actually passed and whether other provisions of the comprehensive development plan or land development regulations may preserve the applicant's vested rights. 
(h)  Judicial review. Any person or legal entity aggrieved by a determination of the city council to deny, grant, or grant with conditions a vested rights special permit may seek judicial review by filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the circuit court seeking review. Said petition must be filed within 30 days after the date of rendition of the final order of the city council and pursuant to the requirements of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.

    Assured construction means and refers to construction improvements to a public facility scheduled to be made to a major thoroughfare link or other roadway, wastewater treatment facility, potable water supply facility, stormwater management system, parks and recreation system, or solid waste disposal facility, or construction or obtaining one of the foregoing by one or more of the following means: 
(i)  For parks and recreation system, stormwater management systems, drainage retention systems, or major thoroughfare link or other roadway improvements, or for solid waste disposal facilities, wastewater treatment facilities or potable water supply facilities, all in relation to a non-final development order, inclusion in the adopted five-year schedule of capital improvements in the capital improvements element of a local government or in the state's five-year schedule of capital improvements, of a funded improvement; provided that, the aforementioned schedule is realistic, financially feasible, is based on currently available revenue sources, and contains estimated project completion dates for the affected public facility; or 
(ii)  For wastewater treatment facilities, solid waste disposal facilities, and potable water supply facilities, if the development permit is a final development order, construction of the facility must be complete, and the facility must be operable and able to supply all capacity needed for a particular proposed project or phase thereof, all prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for structures within the proposed project or phase thereof. For any programmed construction to be considered to be assured construction pursuant hereto, the necessary right-of-way or property needed for the public facility and service must have been obtained prior to the issuance of the development order, and at a minimum, subject to: a binding contract for purchase, currently filed and pending condemnation lawsuit, or binding, uncontested agreement or condition of development approval. If the assured construction (other than for wastewater treatment, solid waste, or potable water) which was relied upon for the issuance of a development order, pursuant to section 3.06(a), was included in the five-year capital improvements program of a local government or the state and the amount of construction or timing of the construction is subsequently deleted from the five-year capital improvements program, final development orders for a proposed project or phase thereof, which proposed project or phase was conditioned on that particular construction may be granted, notwithstanding the original phasing schedule for the deleted construction, as though the construction was completed in accordance with the five-year capital improvements program upon which the development order was based; provided further, that the necessary right-of-way or property has been acquired. For purposes of this paragraph, "deletion" shall mean the elimination of the construction program, the material reduction in the scope of construction work or funding thereof (as it affects the construction program), the postponement of the construction project in the five-year capital improvements program for more than one year beyond the year the construction was originally programmed and funded in the five-year capital improvements program, the failure to let a construction contract, or the removal of or failure to continue funding of the construction program; but shall not include construction delays, design delays, contracting delays, or similar delays. 
    Available means that a particular public facility and service will be provided as follows: 
(1)  The public facility and service is in place to serve a proposed project at the time a development order is granted; 
(2)  A development order is issued subject to the condition that the particular and necessary public facility and service will be in place when the impact upon the public facility and service of the project occurs; 
(3)  The necessary public facility is under construction at the time a development order is issued; 
(4)  The necessary public facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the public facilities or provision of services at the time the development order is issued; 
(5)  The necessary public facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement, including but not limited to a developer's agreement or agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380; or 
(6)  Construction of the public facility is assured construction. 
    Average annual daily traffic (AADT) means and refers to the average of two consecutive 24-hour weekday traffic counts taken at one location, with one count being taken in the peak season and the other in the off-peak season. The traffic volume map(s) shall normally be used to determine existing AADT for the city. Average annual daily traffic existing shall be established by averaging the peak season and off-peak season traffic counts. However, in all cases, where newer data is available from the Florida Department of Transportation or Brevard County and such newer data is substantially consistent with this code, such newer data shall be used. An applicant may provide a traffic count which may be used, subject to the approval of the community development director, based upon accepted traffic engineering principles, and consistent with this chapter 3 instead of the counts on the traffic volume map(s) or where such counts are not available. 
    Average peak hour volume means and refers to the average of peak season and off-peak season turning movements. 
    Background traffic means and refers to the projected traffic generation from previously approved but incomplete projects, as described in section 3 .22(b)(2)h. 
    Building permit means and refers to a development order issued pursuant to the City of Melbourne Building Code. 
    Buildout period means and refers to the time between the issuance of a development order and completion of a proposed project. The buildout period of the proposed project shall be subject to the review and approval of the community development director, based on the following criteria: (i) The size, type and location of the proposed project; (ii) Customary buildout periods for projects of similar size, type, and location; and (iii) Any other factors or conditions relevant to the specific project, including special market conditions and schedules of assured construction. Completion of a project shall mean the issuance of the final certificates of occupancy for structures in a project. In the case of a commercial project, final certificates of occupancy for interior tenant improvements for 80 percent of the gross leasable area shall be the completion of the proposed project. In the case of a residential subdivision project, issuance of final certificates of occupancy for 75 percent of the units, or structures on 75 percent of the lots in the project shall be completion of the project. 
    Capacity means and refers to the availability of a public service or facility to accommodate users, expressed in an appropriate unit of measure, such as gallons per day or average daily trip ends. 
    Capacity enhancement agreement (school) means an agreement that shall provide mitigation measures required to accommodate the estimated number of students that would be generated by proposed development requiring a future land use map amendment and/or rezoning. 
    Capacity reservation extension fee means and refers to a fee used to extend the previously existing reservation of capacity for concurrency purposes in transportation, water or sewer capacity to serve a specific parcel of real property. A capacity reservation extension fee shall be determined periodically by adoption of a resolution by the city council based upon current economic and market conditions and demand for transportation, water and sewer capacity. The collection of this fee shall not occur until after the completion of a review of this chapter by the city council in 2014. The extension of the reservation of transportation, water or sewer may only be made if the capacity has been previously reserved and the pre-existing reservation has not expired. The capacity reservation extension fee is non-refundable, except for a one-time refund option as described in section 3.06. In the event that the reserved capacity is utilized before the reservation of capacity expires for which the capacity reservation extension fee has been paid, the fee paid may be applied as a credit against impact fees due and payable. The capacity reservation extension fee will only reserve transportation, water or sewer capacity and extend a finding of non-deficiency for an additional period beyond the effective date of the initial time of capacity reservation. 
    Capacity reservation fee means and refers to a fee used to reserve capacity for concurrency purposes in transportation, water or sewer capacity to serve a specific parcel of real property. Reservation of transportation, water or sewer capacity may only be made if the city first determines that there is a non-deficiency in transportation, water or sewer capacity to serve a specific and identifiable parcel of real property. A capacity reservation fee shall be determined annually by adoption of a resolution by the city council, based upon current economic and market conditions and demand for transportation, water and sewer capacity. The fee is non-refundable, except for a one-time refund option as described in section 3.06. In the event that the reserved capacity is utilized before the reservation of capacity expires for which the fee has been paid, the fee paid may be applied as a credit against impact fees due and payable. Reservation of capacity may not be moved from one parcel of real property to another parcel of real property. 
    Capacity reservation period means and refers to a period of time that occurs after a determination of available capacity for infrastructure is made and at which time sufficient capacity is held for a specific development project that shall remain valid for the time period as described in this section, subject to payment of the capacity reservation fee and the capacity reservation extension fee, as applicable.

    De minimus project means and refers to development of a single-family residence in a subdivision platted prior to February 8, 1983, or to be developed on an unplatted parcel of land. 
    Developer's agreement means and refers to an agreement entered into pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220 et seq., which the city is a party to and that may assure construction or provision of a public facility and service. 
    Development shall be defined as set forth in F.S. § 380.04. 
    Development order means any order granting, with or without conditions, a development permit, including any amendments to a development permit. 
    Development permit means any building permit, zoning approval, rezoning, subdivision approval (including either preliminary or final plat approval), site plan approval, conditional use, order permitting a Florida quality development, variance approving an exceedance of maximum lot coverages, or approval of a development of regional impact application for development approval. The definition of the term "development permit" shall not be construed to include a certificate of occupancy. 
    Directly accessed means and refers to accessing the link that serves as the project's immediate and direct access or means of ingress and egress. Each access point of a project shall be considered to have access to at least one link; provided that the access points of a project may be considered to share a common link. If a given access point is not immediately connected to a link, the first link connected to the proposed project shall be the link for the purposes of this code. If a project access point is connected to more than one link, project trips shall be assigned to the links in accordance with accepted traffic engineering principles. 
    DOT guidelines means and refers to the Florida Department of Transportation, Quality/Level of Service Handbook, 2013 Edition and Generalized Service Volumes Tables, 2012 Edition and all as subsequently amended and updated.

    Historical traffic growth map means and refers to a map prepared by the community development director, showing the preceding three years' increase or decrease in average annual daily traffic on various state, county, and city arterial and collector links, based upon traffic counts and which provide the information to be used in projecting the background traffic during the buildout period of the proposed project. This map shall be prepared within one month after the effective date of this code and updated as new significant projects are approved. This map shall not include three years of traffic data and information until three years after the effective data of this code. 
    Insignificant impact link study means and refers to a traffic study of any directly accessed links of a proposed insignificant project. 
    Insignificant project means and refers to a project, other than a major project, for which the project trips on every link(s) within the radius of development influence during the buildout period and upon completion of the project are projected to be less than or equal to three percent of the threshold level of service D, as set forth in the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan and computed by use of DOT guidelines. Trips generated by an insignificant project shall be computed by use of the trip generation standards, alternative standards as set forth in section 3.22(b)(1)f.2. of this code, or actual current traffic counts using accepted engineering principles and standards for traffic counts set forth in this code. If the proposed project does not generate more than three percent of the threshold level of service on the proposed project's directly assessed link, it shall be presumed that the rate of traffic generation occurs on all links within the radius of development influence and that the proposed project is therefore an insignificant project. However, this presumption may be rebutted by the city or any interested citizen. 
    Intelligent transportation system (ITS ) refers to a system that improves the safety and efficiency of the transportation network by applying electronic and computer technologies. An ITS improves the network by providing for the real time monitoring of traffic situations and vehicle travel patterns.

Sec. 3.03. - Intent. 
(a)  The city council finds that the safe, convenient, and orderly flow of vehicular traffic; the provision of convenient pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities; the adequate provision of public educational facilities; the availability of adequate convenient and accessible park and recreational facilities; and the availability of safe and adequate supplies of potable water, capacities of wastewater treatment facilities, solid waste disposal facilities, and stormwater management systems and retention facilities is necessary for the health, safety, welfare, economic order, aesthetics, and convenience of the public. It is the intent of this chapter to ensure that roadways, parks and recreation facilities, stormwater management systems, and retention facilities, schools, wastewater treatment facilities and solid waste disposal facilities, and potable water supplies are in place and adequate to meet the levels of service set in the comprehensive plan so as to provide safe, convenient, and orderly services. It is the intent of this chapter to implement the goals, policies, objectives and standards of the comprehensive plan, which provides specific standards, and providing guidelines and procedures for the implementation and enforcement of the standards. The city council finds that the safe, convenient, and orderly furnishing of public facilities and services will be achieved by the standards set forth herein. The city council, intends that, by adopting the standards contained in this chapter, the city is committing to adhere to and implement the requirements of the comprehensive plan. Nothing in this code shall preclude the city council or other authority with the responsibility of issuing development orders from considering traffic, roadway, recreational, open space, wastewater, potable water, solid waste disposal, stormwater management system/retention, schools, or project conditions not specifically addressed in this chapter 3 or which are peculiar to the location, size, configuration, use, or relationship to the area of the proposed project or the proposed project itself. 
(b)  The concurrency evaluation system shall measure the potential impact of any proposed project or expansion to an existing project for which a development order is required, upon the established minimum acceptable level of service for a roadway, solid waste, potable water, drainage, wastewater treatment, schools, or park/recreation public facility or service. The most current available information and data regarding the above public facilities and services operating levels of service shall when reasonably possible and appropriate be utilized for concurrency evaluations. No final development order shall be approved unless adequate public facilities and services are available as determined by the concurrency evaluation. 
(c)  Within the city's mobility districts/TCEAs, development/redevelopment projects must provide or enhance alternative modes of transportation. Within these transportation concurrency exception areas, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes will be considered as an alternative to typical roadway capacity projects within the mobility district areas. Projects that generate ten or more new automobile trips will be required to provide mobility improvements to improve the transportation network. Intersection improvements and new roadway facilities are considered to be mobility improvements/standards and may be considered in appropriate situations as determined by the community development director in consultation with the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, 12-9-2008; Ord. No. 2013-36, § 4(3.03), 5-28-2013) 
Sec. 3.04. - Applicability. 
(a)  Generally. Unless otherwise provided, this code shall apply to all development orders. 
(b)  Previously approved development orders. 
(1)  Existing use. Any application for a development order on a parcel of land which is presently occupied, used, and generating: Traffic, a need for sewage treatment and disposal, a need for potable water supply, a need for solid waste disposal, a need for recreation and open space, or stormwater runoff shall be subject to this chapter only to the extent the traffic generation; the need for additional sewage treatment, potable water, solid waste disposal capacity; the need for additional recreation and open space facilities, or the need for additional drainage retention and stormwater management system capacity, projected for the development order exceeds the traffic generation; the present and existing or permitted wastewater or solid waste generated, potable water utilized, recreation and open space facilities need generated, or stormwater retention capacity and discharge rate (all as determined in accordance with accepted engineering principles), of the existing use. 
(2)  Amendments to development order. Any development order amending a previously-approved development order or permitting an expansion of any type of an existing project which requires road construction, right-of-way acquisition, design, contribution of money, or other improvements to a link or major intersection; additional wastewater treatment facilities; additional potable water capacity; additional solid waste disposal capacity; or additional recreation and open space facilities shall have as a condition of said development order a provision that the requirements of this chapter shall be satisfied when the additional impacts of the development project occur. 
(3)  Development orders. Any application for an amendment to a development order which was issued after the effective date of this code shall be subject to this chapter for all project: Traffic; sewage, potable water, solid waste disposal, recreation and open space needs; and stormwater runoff generated by the portion of the project approved after the effective date of this code, unless the proposed project would result in no increase in project: Traffic, sewage, need for potable water, solid waste, need for additional recreation and open space facilities, or stormwater runoff. 
(c)  Non-applicability. This Code shall not apply to the extent that any vested right is found to exist pursuant to article III of this appendix D or as set forth herein. 
(d)  In mobility districts, any application for a development order projected to generate ten or more new automobile trips per day will provide the appropriate mobility improvement as set forth in article X of this chapter. All development within mobility districts is exempt from the city's transportation concurrency regulations. New development within a mobility district is exempt from the payment of impact fees to the extent the appropriate amount of mobility improvements, as required by article X of this chapter are timely installed. The standards identified in this section apply to all development order applications submitted after May 28, 2013. 
(Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, 12-9-2008; Ord. No. 2013-36, § 4(3.04), 5-28-2013) 
Sec. 3.05. - Application for concurrency evaluation. 
(a)  Application for concurrency evaluation prior to an application for approval of a zoning or rezoning petition. Unless otherwise provided within this chapter, any party submitting an application for approval of a zoning or rezoning of a parcel of land shall submit a concurrency evaluation application to the community development director, together with or prior to submission of the application for zoning or rezoning approval. The application for concurrency evaluation, together with a fee as may be established from time to time by resolution of the city council, shall be on a form which form contains at a minimum the following information: 
(1)  Name, address and telephone number of the owner of the parcel of land, applicant, and of any attorney or other representative of the owner or applicant who may be appearing on behalf of the owner or applicant; 
(2)  Legal description of the project parcel of land; 
(3)  Size of the project parcel of land in acres, including fractional acreage rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of an acre, if known; 
(4)  Zoning classification or other action requested; and 
(5)  Boundary survey. The community development director may waive this requirement; provided that the community development director, shall determine that there is no doubt as to the location of the project parcel of land or its legal description. Any waiver by the community development director shall be subject always to a later determination by said individual, the local planning agency, or the city council as to need for said survey. 
Any application for a development permit must be consistent with the information on which the concurrency evaluation was based. If the applicant increases the intensity or density of the development project proposed during any stage in the development approval process, a new concurrency evaluation will be required. 
(b)  Application for a concurrency evaluation prior to an application for other development order or final development order approval. Any party submitting an application for approval of a final development order or development orders other than a petition for zoning or rezoning approval of a parcel of land shall submit a concurrency evaluation application containing the following information: 
(1)  Specific use or uses proposed or proposed to be expanded; 
(2)  Square footage or number of units of each use; 
(3)  If a subdivision, number and type of units for each phase; 
(4)  An approved on-site stormwater management plan; and 
(5)  All information as set forth in subsection (a) above. 
(c)  Any application for a development permit must be consistent with the information on which the concurrency evaluation was based. If the applicant increases the intensity or density of the development project proposal during any stage in the development approval process, a new concurrency evaluation will be required. 
(d)  Any developer who submits a development permit application with a residential component (which is not exempt) is subject to school concurrency and must prepare a school impact analysis (SIA) and submit it to the city pursuant to article VIII of this code. Once the application is deemed sufficient by the city, the SIA shall be submitted to the school district. The school district will review the SIA to determine the availability of school capacity within the parameters of the adopted LOS. 
(Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, 12-9-2008) 
Sec. 3.06. - Concurrency review. 
(a)  Concurrency evaluation finding of non-deficiency. A preliminary finding of non-deficiency by a concurrency evaluation for a public facility and service as set forth in this code shall remain valid until such time as final action is taken by the city council or planning and zoning board on the development order application granting, denying, or granting with conditions the development permit for which the concurrency evaluation was conducted; provided that application for the development permit shall be submitted simultaneously with the request for a finding of concurrency evaluation. Payment of a capacity reservation fee, as defined herein, is required for the initial finding of water, sewer, and transportation non-deficiency and reservation of capacity. Additionally, development projects requiring more than 40,000 gallons per day (gpd) of applicable water/wastewater usage shall be required to pay a capacity reservation fee equal to double or two times the capacity reservation fee periodically established by the city council and in effect at the time of payment of the fee. Payment of the capacity reservation fees shall be a condition of issuance of the following described development orders. Payment of capacity reservation fees shall not be required for educational facilities which are open to the public and operated by governmental agencies. Once a development permit has been issued, the concurrency evaluation finding of non-deficiency shall remain valid and in force for the following prescribed timeframes: 
(1)  Rezoning/zoning action. For a rezoning or zoning action approval or for a conditional use submitted without a site plan, the finding shall remain valid only for a period not to exceed the time of final action by the city council with regard to the application, and the finding shall be applicable only to the petition for zoning, rezoning, or conditional use and to no other application for a development permit. An applicant shall not be permitted to claim any vested right to a concurrency evaluation finding of non-deficiency obtained simultaneous with an application for a zoning or rezoning petition, unless the finding of non-deficiency was obtained pursuant to a concurrency evaluation application as set forth in section 3.05(b) hereof and complete evaluation as set forth in articles II through VII of this chapter. 
(2)  Formal site plans. For a formal site plan approval or conditional use approval with appurtenant site plan as set forth in appendix B, article IX, section 6(B), the capacity reservation period shall be 1,095 days following the date of rendition of that development order. The capacity reservation period may be extended for an additional 365 days based on the progress made toward the development of the project, such as obtaining the subsequent development orders, obtaining other agency permits, or commencement of site improvements or infrastructure. 
The schedules for payment of capacity reservation fees shall apply except as otherwise provided in an agreement between the city and a property owner or developer, or as otherwise provided in a development order stipulated to by the property owner or developer. 
(3)  Subdivision plats. For a subdivision plat approval, the capacity reservation period shall be 1,826 days following the date of rendition of that development order. The capacity reservation period may be extended for an additional 365 days based on the progress made toward the development of the project, such as obtaining the subsequent development orders, obtaining other agency permits, or commencement of site improvements or infrastructure. A preliminary plat that has not been approved by the city for final plat and recorded with the clerk of court during the capacity reservation period shall be deemed to have expired as an approved development permit and shall have no vested right. 
(4)  Individual infill of undeveloped lots. For an individual single-family residential unit or lot, the capacity reservation period shall be 180 days. 
(5)  Projects with a development agreement. If a developer's agreement with the city as provided in article VIII of this chapter is utilized, a concurrency evaluation may be conducted as a component of a developer's agreement, and if concurrency is found or guaranteed, the capacity reservation period timeframe for the finding's validity and the capacity reservation fee payment schedule shall be set forth in the agreement. 
(6)  Projects initiated through the engineering department. For all site plans not meeting the thresholds for formal site plan under paragraph (2) above, the capacity reservation period shall be 1,095 days following the date of rendition of that development order conditioned upon payment of the capacity reservation fee. The capacity reservation period may be extended for an additional 1,095 days based on the progress made toward the development of the project such as obtaining the subsequent development orders. 
(7)  Projects outside the City of Melbourne. Projects served by the city system but located outside of the city limits shall be subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
(8)  Projects requiring school concurrency review. The Brevard County School District shall perform a capacity determination, concurrency determination, or equivalency determination to ensure that adequate educational facilities are available pursuant to article VIII of this chapter. The school district shall issue a school capacity availability determination letter (SCADL), which identifies whether adequate capacity exists. The SCADL indicates only that school facilities are currently available and that capacity will not be reserved until the city issues a concurrency finding of non-deficiency. 
(b)  One-time refund of capacity reservation fees or one-year extension for projects that have maintained development approvals. All property owners for previously approved development projects (approved prior to June 15, 2011) that paid the original ten percent capacity reservation fee and have remained in a current approved status by the city, may choose a one-time opportunity to recover their current capacity reservation fee balance, in exchange for relinquishing their development approval and capacity reservation, if such fees have not been expended or committed as debt service. Alternatively, a property owner may opt to request a one-year extension of the development approval based upon the progress of the project. This would provide the development project one additional year (until December 31, 2014) to obtain a building permit and payment of impact fees, retaining capacity reservation for the project. 
(c)  Expiration of concurrency evaluation finding of non-deficiency. Where any of the applicable timeframes, as set forth in (a) above, for a particular project expire, a new concurrency evaluation shall be required prior to application for the next development permit. Any vesting period relating to concurrency may be considered void, if the applicant fails to timely perform all requirements to keep the vesting current, including the payment of all fees pursuant to a capacity reservation for a particular public facility or service. If the applicant maintains a capacity reservation on a first come, first serve basis for a particular public facility or service, as set forth in subsection (c) below, the expiration of the concurrency evaluation finding of non-deficiency shall not necessarily nullify said capacity reservations. 
(d)  Cumulative records of level of service. The concurrency evaluation system shall require maintenance of a cumulative record, informally sometimes referred to as "paper trips" or "paper capacity," of the traffic determined to be generated by a proposed project and potable water, sanitary sewerage, solid waste, stormwater management system and retention capacity, and parks and recreation capacity, all determined to be necessary to support all proposed projects. These capacity figures, the need for which has been generated by the approval of a development order, or effectiveness of a finding of non-deficiency of capacity in subsection (a) above, shall be added to the existing capacity of each public facility and service. Upon the expiration of a concurrency evaluation finding of non-deficiency for a proposed project which project is unconstricted or deemed by the community development director to have been abandoned by the applicant, the capacity allocated to that proposed project or portion thereof in a public facility and service in overall existing capacity shall be deleted or "backed-out" of the particular public facility or service's used, reserved, allocated, or unavailable capacity. Said deleted or "backed-out" capacity shall be available for use, reservation, or allocation to other proposed projects on a first come, first serve basis. The Brevard County School District shall monitor and track school capacity. 
(e)  Operating procedures, systems and tasks. 
(1)  Procedures for monitoring. The city shall maintain written or computerized records of all capacity or volumes which are committed for projects as a result of development orders issued by the city. Where another jurisdiction provides services, excluding transportation, to a project, the city will require that the appropriate information regarding those services shall be provided to the city prior to completing a concurrency evaluation. Where another governmental jurisdiction provides services to a project, written evidence of an ability to provide capacity in a public facility and service, excluding transportation and parks and recreation, for a project upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be required at a minimum as a condition of approval of any final development order by the city. The Brevard County School District shall track school capacity and shall make the determination of whether adequate student stations are available or not available. Written evidence of an ability to provide capacity in a public facility and service from another governmental jurisdiction, as required herein, shall be provided by the applicant to the city prior to or simultaneous with the issuance of a final development order. Said written evidence must represent an active and unexpired ability to supply sufficient capacity in a public facility and service to serve a proposed project or phase thereof, as applicable, at the time of issuance of each applicable final development order. 
(2)  Measuring potential impacts. For purposes of measuring the potential impact of a proposed project, all previously committed volumes and capacities shall be taken into account cumulatively and compared to the level of service and total available capacity or volume, as appropriate. 
(3)  Extra-territorial effects. In conducting any concurrency evaluation of a proposed project, the city shall consider impacts to the following public facilities and services located outside the corporate limits of the city: Wastewater treatment facilities serving any portion of the city located east of the Indian River Lagoon and solid waste disposal facilities. In conducting any concurrency evaluation for transportation, drainage retention or stormwater management system capacity, potable water supply capacity, sanitary sewer capacity available from wastewater treatment facilities serving areas within the city west of the Indian River Lagoon, and parks and recreation capacity, the city shall not consider impacts of a proposed project occurring outside the city's corporate limits, unless the city shall have entered into an interlocal agreement with the local governmental entity having jurisdiction over the area within which the proposed project's impacts, as determined by this code, are occurring. The interlocal agreement shall require the permitting local government to consider the impacts (as defined in the interlocal agreement) of proposed projects on public facilities and services within the jurisdictional limits of the non-permitting local government that is a party to the interlocal agreement. The public facility and service level of service as set in the non-permitting local government's comprehensive plan shall form the level of service standard of an affected public facility and service for concurrency evaluation within the non-permitting local government jurisdictional limits. 
(f)  Conditional approval of development orders. If the concurrency evaluation indicates that the potential impact of issuance of a proposed rezoning or zoning, site development plan, conditional use, subdivision, development of regional impact, or Florida quality development, development permit will cause a deficiency to occur to an established minimum acceptable level of service or temporarily acceptable minimum level of service, the city may conditionally approve the development order upon the availability of adequate capacity to serve the impacts of the proposed projects. 
(1)  Non-final development orders. Development orders other than final development orders may be approved if a deficient public facility or service improvement based on the established acceptable levels of service will have available sufficient capacity to accommodate the impact of the proposed project and is contained in the city capital improvements element or the capital improvements programs of other governmental agencies, and said improvement will provide a level of service sufficient to accommodate the potential impact of the proposed project. This section shall not be deemed to bar disapproval of a non-final development order because of the lack of currently existing capacity of any public facility or service. 
(2)  Final development order. For the purpose of concurrency evaluation and unless otherwise provided herein, a final development order may be approved if the necessary public facilities and services are available so as to maintain minimum acceptable levels of service. In all other cases, pursuant to F.S. § 163.3202, a final development order shall not be issued. 
(g)  First come/first served rule. If the community development director shall determine that the grant of a development order for a project would violate this chapter, because: (1) An affected roadway or link is operating below the level of service set by the comprehensive plan and the transportation impacts generated by the project would not be handled by the link or roadway affected by the project concurrent with the generation of transportation impacts by said project; (2) Wastewater treatment facility, park and recreation, drainage retention and stormwater management system, solid waste disposal facility, or potable water, public facilities and services capacity is not available to adequately serve the proposed project such that said public facilities and services will operate at or above the level of service set by the comprehensive plan after impacts generated by the project occur; (3) The community development director's determination is not overturned on an appeal pursuant to section 3.08 hereof; or (4) No other provision in this code is applicable to permit the proposed project to receive a non-final development order, the applicant may request that the project application be placed on a waiting list for reservation of capacity for all public facilities and services deemed by the city to be affected by the project. Simultaneous with the applicant's request to be placed on a reservation list as specified in this subparagraph, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee to be fixed as part of a schedule by resolution of the city council to reserve priority over subsequent applications which are served by the same public facilities and services. Said reservation shall be valid from the date that the application is filed and the fee paid until December 31 of the year in which the application is filed and the fee paid. To keep a reservation of capacity for a project current a request for renewal of the reservation must be filed by no later than January 31 of the year for which the reservation is being renewed. The request for renewal shall be accompanied by a fee to be fixed as part of a schedule adopted by resolution of the city council, and the project reservation of capacity may be renewed in like fashion for each succeeding year thereafter, until such time as a letter determination of concurrency non-deficiency can be issued for all affected public facilities and services. The failure to renew the reservation of capacity by January 31 of any one year shall immediately and automatically invalidate the reservation, and the project's reservation of capacity shall be immediately removed from the waiting list. All applications for reservation of capacity shall then advance forward. The reservation of capacity shall run with the parcel of land and shall be transferable from original applicant to subsequent parcel of land owners and developers of the same parcel of land. Under no circumstances may a reservation of capacity be transferred from one parcel of land to another or be amended to include a different parcel of land, or portion thereof, not originally subject to the capacity reservation. Upon filing of an application for capacity reservation, capacity on all non-deficient public facilities and services pursuant to subsection (c) hereof shall be allocated or reserved to the proposed project until such time as the deficient public facility and service for which an applicant is on a reservation list pursuant hereto shall be non-deficient as to the proposed project. Thereafter, the finding of non-deficiency for all affected public facilities and services shall remain valid for the time provided in and to the extent provided in subsection (a) hereof. 
(h)  The Brevard County School District shall track school capacity and shall make the determination of whether adequate student stations are available or not available. 
(i)  Conditions. All development orders shall contain such conditions as are necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2006-99, § 2, 10-24-2006; Ord. No. 2008-19, § 1, 6-10-2008; Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, 12-9-2008; Ord. No. 2011-18, § 4, 6-14-2011; Ord. No. 2013-44, § 1(3.06), 8-13-2013; Ord. No. 2015-45, § 11, 9-8-2015) 
Note- It should be noted that section 5 of Ord. No. 2011-18 provides, "In conjunction with this ordinance, the City Council will extend the project approvals currently in the system that have paid the original ten percent capacity reservation fee for two years until June 15, 2013. The projects will be eligible for one additional year of approval if it can be demonstrated that progress has been made since this time." 
Sec. 3.07. - Procedure. 
(a)  Application. Unless otherwise requested by the applicant or otherwise required by this chapter, the community development director, shall routinely evaluate an application for compliance with this article. At the time of application, an applicant may elect to submit simultaneous with said application, additional data and studies prepared and signed by a professional planner or engineer using accepted engineering principles. 
(1)  Any developer who submits a development permit application with a residential component (which is not exempt under this article) is subject to school concurrency and must prepare a school impact analysis (SIA) and submit it to the city. Once the application is deemed sufficient by the city, the SIA shall be submitted to the school district. The school district will review the SIA to determine the availability of school capacity within the parameters of the adopted LOS. 
(b)  Review by community development director. Unless otherwise provided within this chapter, the community development director shall review the application and any information submitted to determine whether the proposed project complies with this chapter. 
(1)  Determinations of the community development director, made pursuant hereto must be in writing and any denial shall state the reasons therefor. Within 60 working days of receipt of the study, the community development director, shall issue a written determination concluding one of the following: 
a.  The proposed project does not violate the level of service and concurrency standards of this chapter; or 
b.  The proposed project does not meet the requirements of this chapter, including the detailed reasons for this conclusion; or 
c.  The information submitted is insufficient for the community development director to determine the proposed project's compliance with this chapter. Such a conclusion shall include a request for the specific information needed to enable the community development director, to determine the proposed project's compliance with this chapter. This type of finding shall not be a final determination of an application for concurrency evaluation. 
(2)  Additional information. Within 30 days of receipt of any letter from the community development director, requesting additional information, the person submitting the concurrency evaluation and any traffic study or other data shall either: (a) Submit the additional information; or (b) Notify the community development director in writing that the requested additional information will not be submitted. Within 30 working days of receipt of any additional information or notification that no additional information will be submitted, the community development director shall issue a written determination pursuant to subsection (b)(1) above. Any subsequent request for additional information shall be limited only to information needed to clarify the additional information or answer new questions raised by, or directly related to, the additional information. 
(3)  Determination of noncompliance. Within 20 days of rendition of a letter containing a final determination and stating the proposed project does not meet the requirements of this code, the person submitting the study may submit additional information addressing the reasons listed in the community development director's letter of determination, or may appeal the community development director's, determination pursuant to section 3.08. If additional information is provided, the community development director, shall, within 30 working days of receipt of the additional information, issue a new determination stating that the proposed project meets the requirements of this article or detailing the reasons why the proposed project does not meet the requirements of this code. This new determination letter is appealable within 20 calendar days of the date of rendition pursuant to section 3.08. 
(4)  Determination where insufficient information. If the person submitting the study has notified the community development director, that no additional information will be provided pursuant hereto, and the community development director then issues a written determination that the information submitted is insufficient for the community development director to determine the proposed project's compliance with this chapter of that proposed project does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the person submitting the study may within 20 days of the rendition of the community development director's determination, appeal said determination pursuant to section 3.08 of this chapter. 
(5)  Extension of time. Excepting the limits for appeal, the time limits contained herein may be extended for good cause shown by the applicant with the mutual consent in writing of the community development director, and the person submitting the request for determination. 
(6)  Professional services. Any study, data, or other information, determined by the community development director to be of a technical nature, submitted by an applicant or person other than the city must be prepared and signed by a qualified professional planner or registered professional civil engineer. 
(c)  De minimus project review. Any de minimus project may be reviewed by filing an application meeting the requirements of section 3.05(a) hereof. The application, if completed in proper form, shall be approved by the community development director as noting that all public facilities and services would be non-deficient, unless the community development director determines that such a determination would be contrary to the public health, safety, and welfare, would be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan, and would violate the standards of this code. The reasons for such finding must be set forth in detail, and the applicant shall have a right of appeal pursuant to section 3.08 hereof. For all de minimus projects, the community development director shall administratively allocate or reserve capacity to affected public facilities and services pursuant to section 3.06(c), (d), and the finding of non-deficiency made pursuant to this subsection shall remain valid and in force for the time periods as provided in subsection 3.06(a). Exemptions from the requirements of school concurrency are identified in section 3.04 of this article.

Sec. 3.09. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, adopted December 9, 2008, repealed § 3.09, which pertained to government services. See also the Code Comparative Table. 
Secs. 3.10-3.20. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - TRANSPORTATION CONCURRENCY 

Sec. 3.21. - Standards for projects not located within a mobility district. 
(a)  Generally. For projects that are not located within a mobility district, there is hereby established a transportation concurrency standard for all local roads that are not major thoroughfares and for all major thoroughfares and major intersections within the city. Except as specifically provided in this code, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project that lies outside of a mobility district which would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the amount of traffic a proposed project would generate together with existing, and background traffic, as set forth herein, and comparing it to the level of service established by the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan, which level of service is computed by use of the generalized daily level of service maximums volumes for Florida's urban/urbanized areas, as established in the FDOT Quality/Level of Service Handbook on links within the radius of development influence. Traffic impact studies shall be prepared as set forth herein. The traffic volume map(s) shall be revised by the community development director, at least once each calendar year to reflect the most-current traffic conditions. For state and county roadways, the community development director, may utilize data generated by the governmental entity having operational and maintenance responsibilities for said roadways. 
Projects within the city's mobility districts are exempt from the transportation concurrency standards established in article II of this chapter. The standards for the city's mobility districts are established in article X of this chapter. 
(b)  Significant project standard. 
(1)  Link standard. Except as specifically provided in this code, no development order shall be issued which would, during the buildout period of the project, result in project traffic of more than three percent of the threshold level of service, as set forth in the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan and as computed by use of DOT guidelines, at any point on any major thoroughfare link within the project's radius of development influence, if the total traffic on that link would result in an average annual daily traffic volume that exceeds the threshold level of service during the buildout period of the project. For purposes of this analysis, assured construction shall be considered. 
(2)  Intersection standard. A methodology shall be developed by September 1, 1990, for concurrency evaluation of the traffic impacts of a proposed project on major thoroughfare intersections within the proposed project's radius of development influence. 
(3)  Table 1 represents the maximum radius of development influence for specific types of proposed projects to be used considering traffic impacts pursuant to this code. The actual radius of development influence may be more.

(4)  Phasing. Phasing may be utilized by the applicant to establish compliance with the transportation level of service if the following conditions are met: 
a.  The proposed phasing results in the links and intersections of the proposed project complying with the link and intersection standards set forth in section 3.21 during the buildout period of the project. 
b.  The proposed phasing comports with the extent and timing of the assured construction. 
c.  The community development director confirms that construction is in fact assured construction. 
d.  For any assured construction which is to be completed by the applicant, a condition of approval of an appropriate development order must be imposed, a developer's agreement executed or sufficient performance security in favor of the city presented to the city, all as determined to be appropriate by the city. 
(c)  Insignificant project standard. 
(1)  Conditions. An application for an insignificant project may be accepted and a development order may be issued provided that the level of service and the volume to capacity ratio (v/c) on the directly accessed link as shown on the traffic volume map does not exceed the level of service and the volume to capacity ratio, if any, specified for said link by the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Phasing. A specified development order for an insignificant project may be issued and phased based upon assured road construction provided the standards in this section are met. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 4(3.21), 5-28-2013) 
Sec. 3.22. - Traffic impact studies. 
(a)  Generally. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this code, the applicant shall be required by the city at the applicant's expense to submit a significant impact traffic study, unless the proposed project is an insignificant project. The determination that a proposed project is a significant project shall be made by the community development director by use of the DOT guidelines and trip generation standards, or a traffic and analysis prepared using generally accepted traffic engineering standards and satisfying the standards in subsection (b)(2)m. The community development director's determination that a proposed project is or is not a significant project is appealable by a substantially affected person pursuant to section 3.08 hereof. 
(b)  Significant impact traffic study. 
(1)  Scope. A significant impact traffic study shall be required for any proposed significant project. It shall address the requirements and standards of this code; shall be presented concisely using maps whenever practicable; and shall state all assumptions and sources of information. The form and level of detail required shall be established by the community development director, in accordance with accepted engineering principles for traffic and transportation. 
(2)  Methodology. Unless the applicant can, to the satisfaction of the development community director, affirmatively demonstrate that, because of circumstances peculiar to the proposed project or major thoroughfare system impacted by the proposed project, or because other methods or standards provide a more accurate means to evaluate the links, intersections, and traffic impact of the proposed project, the following methods of evaluation, standards, and information shall be addressed: 
a.  Level of service. The level of service standard as defined in DOT guidelines for all levels of service on major thoroughfares as set by the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan within the radius of development influence established by Table 1 shall be used. 
b.  Traffic assignment. The total traffic shall be computed, and traffic assignments of the total project traffic made, for each link, and upon development of a concurrency evaluation methodology for intersection, for each major intersection within the project's radius of development influence in conformity with the comprehensive plan and accepted engineering principles for traffic and transportation. The assignments shall be projected for and cover the buildout period of the project. 
c.  Radius of development influence. The traffic study shall define the radius of development influence consistent with this section and Table 1 hereof. 
d.  Projected buildout period. The projected buildout period of the project shall be set forth in the study. 
e.  Existing traffic (AADT). Average annual daily traffic shall be used as defined in this code. Where current data are not available to establish existing AADT, the applicant shall elect one of the following methods to establish average annual daily traffic: 
1.  Counts. The applicant may provide traffic counts if approved by the community development director, in accordance with accepted engineering principles for traffic and transportation. Counts shall be made during any continuous 24-hour period from 6:00 a.m., Monday to 8:00 p.m. Friday, except legal holidays, unless otherwise authorized or required by the community development director, in accordance with accepted engineering principles for traffic and transportation. All data are subject to review and acceptance by the community development director, based upon accepted engineering principles for traffic and transportation. 
2.  Factors. Where a peak season or off-peak season traffic count is not readily available, the following shall be used to obtain the average annual daily traffic using daily traffic counts (DT) taken at the closest or most appropriate count station to the subject link in accordance with accepted engineering principles: 
DTP = Daily traffic count taken in peak season 
DTO = Daily traffic count taken in off-peak season 
F = Peaking factor = DTP - DTO 
DTP Average annual = Off-peak volume x [(1 + (F/2)] 
Daily Traffic Average annual = Peak volume x [(1 - (F/2)] 
Daily traffic if F is negative use zero 
f.  Traffic generation. Traffic generated by the project shall be computed in the following manner: 
1.  ITE. The rates published in the trip generation standards shall be used, unless the community development director accepts that other standards provide a more accurate means to evaluate the rates of generation based upon documentation supplied by the applicant which affirmatively demonstrates such based on accepted engineering principles. 
2.  Local conditions. The community development director may publish and update from time to time, trip generation rates for local conditions and, if applicable, these rates shall be used instead of the trip generation standards. 
3.  Similar developments. Actual traffic counts which establish the generation rate at three similar existing projects located in similar areas as the one proposed may be used, if approved by the community development director, in accordance with accepted engineering principles for traffic and transportation. These counts shall be made for the weekdays (excluding legal holidays) as set forth in this section for each site and averaged. 
g.  Captured trips. It is acknowledged that some trips generated by a proposed nonresidential project are from existing traffic passing the proposed project and are not newly generated trips. Credit against the trip generation of the proposed project may be taken for these trips up to the percentage shown in table 2. The study must detail: (i) All traffic generated from the project and the turning movements, and (ii) The number of captured trips subtracted from the traffic generated by the project, during the buildout period of the project. Uses other than those listed below, and any percentage credit proposed to be taken in excess of that shown in table 2, must be justified based on accepted engineering principles for traffic and transportation to the satisfaction of the community development director, as part of the required traffic study, based upon the peculiar characteristics and location of the proposed project. Factors which should be considered in determining a different capture rate include type and size of land use, location with respect to service population, location with respect to competing uses, location with respect to the surrounding major thoroughfare system, and existing and projected traffic volumes.

h.  Background traffic. 
1.  Generally. Existing traffic volumes will likely increase or decrease during the buildout period of the proposed project. The traffic study must account for this increase or decrease in traffic based on background traffic during the buildout period of the proposed project. The projection of background traffic shall be based upon the information set forth on the historical traffic growth rate map and the map of major projects and shall be established in accordance with the requirements set forth in this code and accepted engineering principles. This change in traffic shall be shown as it relates to the proposed phasing. 
2.  Historical growth maps. Using the historical traffic growths maps of the community development director, the study shall project the increase or decrease in traffic volumes based on background traffic within the proposed project's radius of development influence during the buildout period of the proposed project. The effect of major projects shall be considered in projecting the increase or decrease in traffic volumes. 
3.  Major project maps. Using the major project maps, all traffic from the unbuilt portion of major projects approved prior to the proposed project's traffic study which will add more trips than ten percent of the threshold level of service on each significant link within the proposed project's radius of development influence during the buildout period of the proposed project shall be specifically accounted for in projecting background traffic. No double counting of trips shall occur, and the historically derived projections shall be adjusted based upon the impact of major projects. Only the traffic generated from the unbuilt portions of the major projects as set forth above which are projected to be built during the buildout period of the proposed project shall be considered. 
4.  Background traffic. The projection of background traffic during the buildout period of the proposed project shall be based upon, and subject to the review and approval of the community development director, using the following criteria: (i) historical growth shown on maps maintained by the community development director; (ii) characteristics of growth in the radius of development influence; (iii) extent of existing, approved, and likely development in the radius of development influence; (iv) types and sizes of development in the area; (v) traffic circulation in the area; (vi) major projects impact; and (vii) new and assured construction. 
i.  Assured construction. Assured construction shall be considered completed as scheduled for the purpose of preparation of the study. Whether it is in fact assured construction and the timing of the assured construction shall be subject to the confirmation of the community development director. 
j.  Project phasing. The traffic study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of the proposed project. This schedule shall address the time at which each phase will place traffic impacts on the major thoroughfares within the radius of development influence and shall include the following: 
1.  Generation. Project traffic figures and assignments for each proposed phase; and 
2.  Assured construction. Where the evaluation of phased traffic impact includes the effect of assured construction, sufficient information regarding the proposed construction to ensure that the roadways realistically will be constructed at the times stated. 
k.  Intersection analysis. Upon development of a methodology for intersection concurrency evaluation, all major intersections within the proposed project's radius of development influence to which the proposed project would, if approved, add more than ten percent of total traffic on an AADT basis for any link adjacent to of the major intersection during the buildout period of the project shall be analyzed as follows: 
1.  1985 Highway Capacity Manual. The analysis shall be based on the intersection analysis (signalized or unsignalized, as appropriate), Transportation Research Board Special Report 209, as revised, updated, or superseded from time to time. 
2.  Assured construction. The intersection analysis shall include only existing or assured construction as it relates to intersections. 
3.  Peak hours. Generally, the study shall address both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, unless traffic characteristics dictate that only one of the peak hours be analyzed. In those cases, the community development director, may still require analysis of other peak hours where indicated by accepted traffic engineering principles. The total peak hours analyzed shall not exceed two in number. 
l.  Compliance. The analysis must demonstrate compliance with the standards contained in section 3.21(b)(1), (2). 
m.  Professional services. The traffic study for significant projects shall be prepared signed by a qualified professional traffic planner or engineer. 
(c)  Insignificant impact link study. Submittal of a traffic study by an applicant for a proposed insignificant project shall not be required, although an applicant may in its discretion submit a traffic study. The traffic study for an insignificant project shall consist of an examination of only the directly accessed links. Such study shall comply with the standards and requirements for a significant impact traffic study set forth in subsection (b) above to the extent necessary to establish the project's trip generation and the volume to capacity ratio on the directly accessed links. 
(d)  Site-related improvements. In addition to the link and intersection standards and studies, the peak hour(s) turning movements shall be shown and analyzed using 1985 Highway Capacity Manual for all points where the project's traffic meets the directly accessed links or other roads. No credit shall be taken for captured trips in this analysis. Recommendations shall be made concerning signalization and turn lanes, and the city may require such to ensure the safe and orderly flow of traffic. 
Sec. 3.23. - Procedure. 
(a)  Required submission of impact study. 
(1)  Simultaneous with application. Simultaneous with the submittal of any application for a development order, the applicant must provide one of the following: 
a.  Documentation sufficient to establish that the application is an insignificant project; 
b.  A significant impact traffic study; or 
c.  An insignificant impact link study, if the proposed project is an insignificant project. 
An application for a development order shall not be deemed to be complete until accomplishment by the applicant of one of the requirements of this section. 
(2)  Review by community development director. The community development director shall review the information submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1) above, and determine whether the application is complete for review. 
Sec. 3.24. - Proportionate fair-share option. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The intent of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
(b)  Findings. 
(1)  The Melbourne City Council finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and the city proportionate fair-share program: 
a.  Provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors; 
b  Allows developers to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair-share of the cost of a transportation facility; 
c.  Contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion; 
d.  Maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may, in certain circumstances, allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element (CIE); and 
e.  Is consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16), and supports the goals, objectives, and policies contained in the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan as they relate to concurrency management and capital improvements planning and programming. 
(c)  Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city concurrency management system (CMS), including transportation facilities maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the requirements of subsection (d). The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in [reference appropriate sections in concurrency ordinance, policies in comprehensive plan, and/or F.S. § 163.3180, regarding exceptions and de minimis impacts]. 
(d)  General requirements. 
(1)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
b.  The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the city CIE or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS includes a transportation improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation CMS. The provisions of subsection (d)(2) may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the local government CIE or an adopted long-term schedule of capital improvements. 
(2)  The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation CMS, but is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or a long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS, where the following apply: 
a.  The city adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE or long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city council, and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)1, consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. Financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
b.  If the funds allocated for the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the city CIE are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the CMS, the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year capital improvements schedule of the comprehensive plan or the long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term concurrency management system at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the city for locally maintained roadways, design standards of Brevard County for county maintained roadways, and design standards of the FDOT for the state highway system. 
(e)  Intergovernmental coordination. Pursuant to policies in the intergovernmental coordination element of the city comprehensive plan and applicable policies in East Central Florida Regional Policy Plan, the city shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. An interlocal or multi-party agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
(f)  Application process. 
(1)  Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements of subsection (d). 
(2)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the SIS, then the FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. If the impacted facility is a Brevard County maintained roadway, then Brevard County staff will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(3)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application fee of $1,000.00 and the following: 
a.  Name, address and phone number of owner, developer and agent; 
b.  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
c.  Legal description and survey of property; 
d.  Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development; 
e.  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
f.  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method; and 
g.  Copy of concurrency application. 
(4)  The community development department shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete within ten business days. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in subsection (d), then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten business days of submittal of the application. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 15 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The city may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed 30 days to cure such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(5)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrence of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share or other multi-party agreement. 
(6)  When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility, no later than 120 days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than 30 days prior to the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(7)  The city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the Melbourne City Council. 
(g)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, design services, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. Specifically, the proportionate fair share contribution dollar amount shall not vary among potential, alternative mitigation options. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
"The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS." 
OR 
Proportionate fair-share = S[[(Development trips i ) / (SV increase i )] x Cost i ] 
Where: 
Development trips i = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the CMS; 
SV increase i = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per section D; 
Cost i = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(4)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIE, the MPO/TIP or the FDOT Work Program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
a.  An analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city council. In order to accommodate increases in construction material costs, project costs shall be annually adjusted by three percent; or 
b.  The most recent issue of FDOT Transportation Costs, as adjusted based upon the type of cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT Work Program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the FDOT district. 
(5)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(6)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the Brevard County Property Appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city's estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to purchase or acquisition of any real estate or acceptance of donations of real estate intended to be used for the proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact the FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(h)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the local government's impact fee ordinance. 
(2)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due per the city impact fee ordinance. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of the city impact fee ordinance. 
(3)  Major projects not included within the local government's impact fee ordinance or created under subsection (d)(2)a. and b. which can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible at the local government's discretion for impact fee credits. 
(4)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within the local impact fee ordinance. 
(i)  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  Upon approval of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) by the city council, the applicant shall receive a city certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within 12 months, or a timeframe otherwise established in the local CMS, of the execution of the agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(2)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than 12 months from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to subsection (g) and adjusted accordingly. 
(3)  All developer improvements authorized under this ordinance must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this section that any required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
(4)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(5)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city will be non refundable. 
(7)  The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(j)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the local government, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the FDOT TRIP. 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of subsection (d)(2)b. 
Where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in F.S. § 339.155, the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(3)  Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under subsection (g), the city shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods: 
a.  An impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution, a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the city. 
b.  An account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fair-share payments from future applicants on the facility. 
c.  The city may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution through payment or some combination of means acceptable to the city and the applicant.

ARTICLE III. - SANITARY SEWER CONCURRENCY 

Sec. 3.36. - Standard. 
(a)  Generally. There is hereby established a sanitary sewer concurrency standard for all wastewater treatment facilities serving development projects within the city. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project which would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the capacity of the wastewater treatment facilities which shall be determined by utilizing the existing capacity available to serve proposed projects. The existing capacity shall be determined by computing the total of the committed flow to other proposed projects plus present average daily flow of the wastewater treatment facility to be impacted by a proposed project, as reasonably determined by the community development director using accepted engineering principles. This gallonage figure shall be subtracted from the design capacity of the wastewater treatment facilities, thereby yielding the wastewater treatment facility capacity that can be supplied to the proposed project. The capacity needed by the proposed project shall be determined by utilizing the level of service standard of 240 gallons per day per single-family residential unit and for other than single-family residential use a gallonage per day calculated by use of the formula set forth in Table 3 below.

The total equivalent residential connection value for an establishment shall be calculated by multiplying the ERU factor listed above times the number of units. 
For all establishments not listed above, the total ERU value shall be determined by multiplying the number of fixture units, as published in the Standard Plumbing Code, by 25, and then dividing that numerator by 240 GPD/ERU. For example: 
Total ERU value = Number of fixture units x 25/240 GPD. 
Unless a development order is issued pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, no development order shall be granted, unless conditioned upon the availability to the proposed project of a sufficient capacity in a wastewater treatment facilities to provide service to the project. No final development order shall be granted unless, using the standards set forth herein, wastewater treatment facility capacity can be supplied to serve the proposed project concurrent with the impacts of the project. 
(b)  On-site sewage disposal system. Where septic tanks are permitted by applicable city regulations and are to be utilized, the Brevard County Consumer Health Services Division shall utilize the standards of chapter 10D-6, Florida Administrative Code, to determine that on-site sewage disposal systems are permitted and under what conditions, if any. Unless a development order is issued pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, no development order shall be issued, unless conditioned upon hook-up to an on-site disposal system operated in compliance with chapter 10D-6, Florida Administrative Code. No final development order shall be granted until the applicant shall submit to the community development director a certificate from the Brevard County Health Department that certifies that the site is or will be made suitable for the use of an on-site sewage disposal system. 
(c)  Determination of capacity. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the city shall compute the capacity available to serve a particular proposed project. The applicant may submit additional data or information pursuant to section 3.07(b). Any additional information shall be based on accepted engineering principles. If the capacity availability being analyzed is from a wastewater treatment facility operated by a person other than the city, including, but not limited to, Brevard County, prior to the issuance of a final development order, a certificate from said person operating the wastewater treatment facility must be submitted to the community development director. The certificate must affirm the existence of sufficient capacity, considering facility design flow, present average daily flow, committed flow, and the comprehensive plan and table 3, level of service standards, in this code, all for the wastewater treatment facility that will serve the proposed project. Further, the certificate must affirmatively indicate that said capacity has been reserved for the proposed project and the duration of the reservation. Upon expiration of said reservation, notwithstanding any other provision in this code, the applicant will be required to undergo a new concurrency evaluation. 
(1)  Projected buildout period. The evaluation shall consider reserved capacity or any capacity to which another proposed project shall have a prior and superior claim during the proposed project's projected buildout period. The projected buildout period of the proposed project shall be set forth in the evaluation and shall be determined by the community development director based on the following criteria: (i) The size, type and location of the proposed project; (ii) Customary buildout periods for projects of similar size, type, and location; and (iii) Any other factors or conditions relevant to the specific project, including special market conditions and schedules of assured construction. Existing available capacity will likely increase or decrease during the buildout period of the proposed project. The study must account for this increase or decrease in available treatment capacity based on conditions during the buildout period of the proposed project. The projection of available treatment capacity shall be based upon the difference between the permitted design of the wastewater treatment facilities less the cumulative sum of average daily flow and committed flow at the time of submission and shall be established in accordance with the requirements set forth in this article and accepted engineering principles. This change in treatment capacity shall be shown as it relates to any proposed phasing. 
(2)  Assured construction. Assured construction shall be considered completed as scheduled for the purpose of preparation of the evaluation. Whether it is in fact assured construction and the timing of the assured construction shall be subject to the confirmation of the community development director. 
(3)  Project phasing. The study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of the proposed project. This schedule shall address the time at which each phase will place impacts on the wastewater treatment facility to be impacted at the time of submission of each phase. Wastewater treatment capacity will not be taken into consideration unless the project is permitted by the State of Florida, Department of Environmental Protection during initial application.

ARTICLE V. - SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL CONCURRENCY 

Sec. 3.56. - Standard. 
(a)  Generally. There is hereby established a solid waste disposal concurrency standard for all solid waste disposal facilities serving properties within the city. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project which would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the capacity for solid waste disposal facilities which shall be determined by utilizing the existing capacity. The existing capacity shall be determined by computing the total of the committed capacity to other proposed projects plus the existing amount of solid waste generated. This figure shall be subtracted from the design capacity of the solid waste disposal facility impacted, thereby yielding the solid waste disposal facility capacity that can be used by a proposed project. The amount of solid waste generated by the proposed project and impacting a solid waste disposal facility shall be determined utilizing the existing applicable solid waste disposal facility level of service of 7.51 pounds of solid waste per capita per day. 
No development order shall be granted unless conditioned upon the availability to the project of a sufficient capacity of solid waste disposal facilities to provide service to the project. No final development order shall be granted unless, using the standards set forth herein, solid waste disposal facility capacity can be supplied to serve the proposed project concurrent with the impacts of the project. 
(b)  Determination of capacity. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the city shall compute the capacity available to serve a particular proposed project.

ARTICLE VI. - PARKS/RECREATION CONCURRENCY 

Sec. 3.66. - Standard. 
(a)  Generally. There is hereby established a recreation and open space concurrency standard for all residential proposed projects within the city. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a residential proposed project which would violate this standard. Establishment of concurrency shall be ascertained by determining the need expressed in acreage, rounded downward to the nearest one-tenth acre, that a proposed project will generate, as set forth herein. The need generated by a proposed project, expressed in fractional acreage, shall be added to the "existing demand," also expressed in fractional acreage rounded to the nearest one-tenth acre. Existing demand shall be computed by estimating the projected population of existing constructed projects and other permitted proposed projects in which capacity has been reserved, allocated, or assigned as set forth in this code, herein. For the purposes of this article VI, the level of service standard established for recreation and open space shall be three acres of parkland per 1,000 persons. Both city maintained and county maintained parks within the city may be included in the parkland acreage figure. "Existing demand," as that term is used in this article VI, shall include demand created by constructed residential projects and proposed projects permitted but unbuilt which have been allocated or reserved capacity as set forth in this code. Existing demand plus demand or need generated by the proposed project shall represent total demand. 
(b)  Determination of capacity. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the city shall compute the capacity available to serve a particular proposed project. The applicant may submit additional data or information pursuant to section 3.07(b). Any additional information shall be based on accepted engineering principles. 
(1)  Projected buildout period. The projected buildout period of the proposed project shall be set forth in the evaluation and shall be determined by the community development director based on the following criteria: (i) The size, type and location of the proposed project; (ii) Customary buildout periods for projects of similar size, type, and location; and (iii) Any other factors or conditions relevant to the specific project, including special market conditions and schedules of assured construction. Existing available capacity will likely increase or decrease during the buildout period of the proposed project. The study must account for this increase or decrease in available capacity based on conditions during the buildout period of the proposed project. 
(2)  Project phasing. The study may reflect a proposed phasing schedule for the development of the proposed project. This schedule shall address the time at which each phase will place impacts on neighborhood, community and regional park facilities to be impacted at the time of submission of each phase.

ARTICLE VII. - DRAINAGE CONCURRENCY 

Sec. 3.76. - Standard. 
(a)  Generally. There is hereby established a drainage retention and stormwater management system concurrency standard for all parcels of land within the city. Except as specifically provided in this article, no development order shall be issued for a proposed project which would violate this standard. All development orders shall be conditioned upon satisfaction of the level of service standards in this section. Establishment of satisfaction of the concurrency standard herein shall be ascertained through submission of a stormwater management plan as provided in this code. The level of service standard for concurrency evaluation herein shall require the retention of the first inch of runoff from a ten-year, 24-hour storm event in a proposed project and for the proposed project's impact on the stormwater management system the level of service standard is the capacity to convey runoff from a 25-year, 24-hour storm event. Single-family residential platted lots within a subdivision which were platted after February 8, 1983, are exempt from this requirement. All other single-family residential platted lots or parcels shall demonstrate adherence to this minimum acceptable level of service standard. 
Sec. 3.77. - Stormwater management plan. 
(a)  Generally. In order to demonstrate that an application for a development order complies with this article, the applicant shall be required by the city to submit a stormwater management plan at the time of engineering review but in no event later than the time of application for the earlier of site plan or preliminary plat review or review for issuance of a final development order. The stormwater management plan shall address the requirements and standards of this article and chapter 50, City Code of Melbourne, Florida, and shall assure that the proposed project will have drainage retention capacity and that there is stormwater management system capacity sufficient to meet or exceed the level of service set forth herein and in the comprehensive plan. The form and level of detail required in the stormwater management plan shall be established by the community development director in accordance with accepted engineering principles, but in no event shall such form and detail be less than is set forth in chapter 50, City Code of Melbourne, Florida. 
(b)  Professional services. The stormwater management plan shall be prepared, sealed and signed by a qualified professional engineer, licensed to practice in the State of Florida.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2008-68, § 2, adopted December 9, 2008, renumbered art. VIII as art. IX and added provisions designated as a new art. VIII, §§ 3.78-3.82, to read as herein set out. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 3.78. - Standard. 
(a)  Generally. There is hereby established a public school concurrency standard for all educational facilities within the city. Except as provided by this article, no development order shall be issued which would violate this standard. For the purpose of this section, a development order includes any site plan, preliminary plat, or functional equivalent for new residential development. Establishment of satisfaction of the concurrency standard herein shall be ascertained through submission of a school impact analysis, which shall be reviewed by the Brevard County School District to determine the availability of school capacity within the adopted level of service (LOS). 
(b)  Level of service. To ensure adequate capacity for each year of the five-year planning period and over the long-term planning timeframe, the following LOS is established for the public schools in each concurrency service area (CSA): 
(1)  A tiered level of service shall be in effect for the five-year planning period, terminating in school year 2011-2012. Upon achieving the LOS standard of 100 percent permanent FISH capacity, by school year 2011-2012, the tiered LOS will be terminated.

(Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, 12-9-2008) 
Sec. 3.79. - Exemptions. 
    The following residential uses are exempt from the requirements of school concurrency: 
(a)  Single-family lots of record, existing at the time the school concurrency implementing ordinance becomes effective. 
(b)  Any new residential development that has a preliminary plat or site plan approval or the functional equivalent for a site specific development order prior to the commencement date of the school concurrency program. 
(c)  Any amendment to any previously approved residential development that does not increase the number of dwelling units or change the type of dwelling units (single-family to multifamily, etc.). 
(d)  Age restricted communities with no permanent residents under the age of 18. Exemption of an age restricted community will be subject to a restrictive covenant limiting the age of permanent residents to 18 years and older. 
(e)  The replacement of an existing residential dwelling unit, including those partially or entirely damaged, destroyed or demolished, with a new unit of the same type and use provided that the existing unit has been occupied at some time during the five-year period immediately preceding the construction of the new unit. 
(Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, 12-9-2008) 
Sec. 3.80. - School concurrency application review. 
(a)  Application process. Any developer who submits a development permit application with a residential component (which is not exempt under this article) is subject to school concurrency and must prepare a school impact analysis (SIA) and submit it to the city. The SIA shall include the following information: 
(1)  The maximum number and type of dwelling units to be included in the proposed development. 
(2)  A map depicting the location of the proposed development. 
(3)  A copy of the plat, site plan, or functional equivalent. 
(4)  A date-specific project phasing and build-out schedule (when applicable). 
(5)  The current or proposed future land use map designation and zoning classification of the subject site. 
(6)  Age restrictions (when applicable). 
Once the application is deemed sufficient by the city, the SIA shall be submitted to the school district. The school district will review the SIA to determine the availability of school capacity within the parameters of the adopted LOS. 
(b)  School district review. 
(1)  School capacity determination. If the application pertains to a comprehensive plan amendment, rezoning, or similar preliminary development order, the school district will prepare a school capacity determination (SCD). An SCD is a non-binding review that analyzes student generation relative to existing school capacities and the five-year capital facilities work program. The review provides information/recommendations relative to capacities, sidewalk locations, bus pick-up and drop-off locations, traffic considerations/improvements, etc. Should an SCD indicate that insufficient school capacity exists as required to maintain the adopted LOS, a capacity enhancement agreement may be negotiated and executed. The agreement may provide mitigation measures that are required if the proposed development is to receive final development order approval. 
(2)  Concurrency determination. If the application concerns a project that warrants the issuance of a final development order, a concurrency determination shall be prepared by the school district. Should a concurrency determination indicate that insufficient school capacity exists as required to maintain the adopted LOS, then the local government shall not issue a final development order. The proportionate share mitigation process may be enacted if school capacity is deemed not to be available. If a proportionate fair-share agreement is established, then the proposed development may receive a final development order. 
(3)  Equivalency determination. If the application pertains to an amendment to an existing development order, an equivalency determination shall be issued by the school district. This process applies to any amendment or revision to an approved development order. It includes re-evaluating capacity set aside for a project to ensure that sufficient school capacity is in place to serve the proposed changes to the development order. If additional capacity must be reserved, then a concurrency determination shall also be obtained. 
(c)  The school district shall review each SIA and verify whether sufficient student stations for each type of residential units are available (or not available) in the proposed development's concurrency service area (CSA). If the projected student growth from a residential development causes the adopted LOS to be exceeded in a CSA, an adjacent CSA will be reviewed for available capacity. 
(d)  School capacity availability determination letter (SCADL). When capacity has been determined to be available, the school district shall issue an SCADL within ten days of receipt of the application. 
(1)  In the event there is not adequate capacity available in the CSA in which the proposed development is located or in an adjacent CSA, the school district will issue an SCADL that details why the proposed project is not in compliance and offer the applicant the opportunity to enter into a proportionate share agreement to mitigate the development's impacts upon public school facilities. 
(2)  When capacity is determined to be available, the school district shall issue an SCADL verifying capacity availability to the applicant. 
(e)  School concurrency approval. Issuance of an SCADL by the school district, which identifies whether adequate capacity exists, indicates only that school facilities are currently available and that capacity will not be reserved until the city issues a concurrency finding of non-deficiency. The finding of non-deficiency shall remain in effect for the timeframes identified in section 3.06 of this article. 
(f)  Notification requirements. The city shall notify the school district when a concurrency finding of non-deficiency is issued, when a development order for the residential development expires or is revoked, and when school impact fees have been remitted. 
(Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, 12-9-2008) 
Sec. 3.81. - Appeal process. 
    A person may appeal a determination made as part of the school concurrency process. A person substantially affected by the school district's capacity determination made as part of the school concurrency process may appeal such determination through the process outlined in F.S. ch. 120. A person substantially affected by the city's decision which was made as a part of the school concurrency process may appeal such decision using the process established in this code. 
(Ord. No. 2008-68, § 1, 12-9-2008) 
Sec. 3.82. - Proportionate share mitigation. 
    Proportionate share mitigation shall be administered by the school district. When sufficient school capacity is not available, the school district shall entertain proportionate share options and, if accepted, shall enter into an enforceable and binding agreement with the developer and the city to mitigate the impact from the proposed residential project through the creation of additional school capacity.

At the termination of the duration of the developer's agreement, all then existing codes shall become applicable to the development regardless' of the terms of the developer's agreement, and as appropriate, the said developer's agreement shall be modified accordingly. The application of such laws and policies governing the development of the parcel of land shall not provide for any vesting as to any fees or fee structure, including any impact fees, then in existence or thereafter imposed. 
(b)  The city may apply ordinances and policies adopted subsequently to the execution of the developer's agreement to the parcel of land subject to the developer's agreement, only if the city has held a public hearing and determined that: (i) such new ordinances or policies are not in conflict with the laws and policies governing the developer's agreement and do not prevent development of the land uses, intensities or densities as allowed under the terms of the developer's agreement; (ii) such new ordinances or policies are essential to the public health, safety, or welfare and the new ordinances or policies expressly state that they shall apply to a development that is subject to a developer's agreement; (iii) such new ordinances or policies are specifically anticipated and provided for in the developer's agreement; (iv) the city has demonstrated that substantial changes have occurred in pertinent conditions existing at the time of the approval of the development agreement; or (v) the developer's agreement is based on substantially inaccurate information supplied by the developer. All developer's agreements shall specifically provide that subsequently adopted ordinances and policies of general application in the city, specifically including, but not limited to, impact fees shall be applicable to the parcel of land subject to the developer's agreement and that such modifications are specifically anticipated in the developer's agreement. 
(c)  In the event that state and federal laws are enacted after the execution of a developer's agreement which are applicable to and preclude the parties' compliance with the terms of the developer's agreement, such agreement shall be modified or revoked as is necessary to comply with the relevant state or federal laws, such modification or revocation to take place only after the notice provisions provided for the adoption of a developer's agreement have been complied with. Such persons as are defined by state law shall have standing to enforce the developer's agreement.

ARTICLE X. - MOBILITY DISTRICTS 

Sec. 3.101. - Standard. 
(a)  Intent and applicability. In order to promote alternative modes of transportation and to encourage urban infill and redevelopment, the city establishes mobility districts. Development and redevelopment projects within mobility districts are exempt from the city's transportation concurrency requirements. Projects within mobility districts are required to provide a variety of pedestrian, bicycle, transit and vehicular alternatives which benefit the overall transportation network. Projects within mobility districts will not be subject to transportation impact fees; however, a developer or property owner may choose to make a payment in lieu of providing the required mobility improvements. This process is described in section 3.103 of this article. 
(b)  Issuance and compliance of development order. The city's mobility districts are identified on Map III-9 of the transportation element within the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan. No development order will be issued for a proposed project within a mobility district that violates this standard. All development order applications submitted subsequent to May 28, 2013 must comply with the standards established in this section. 
(c)  Exceptions. Building permits for developments approved before May 28, 2013 will be required to provide any transportation improvements, modifications, mitigation, or impact fees required as part of a previous development plan approval. Such projects will not be required to provide mobility standards as set forth in chapter 3 of this code. Building permits approved before May 28, 2013 will also be required to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements as established in appendix D, chapter 3, article II of this code. Any modification to an approved development plan submitted after May 28, 2013 will be required to comply with the mobility improvements criteria established in this section. 
(d)  Payment of impact fees required. If for any reason the requirement for the provision of mobility standards is determined by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable, the developer or property owner of a project will be required to pay impact fees as set forth in chapter 10 of this appendix. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 5(3.101), 5-28-2013) 
Sec. 3.102. - Procedure. 
(a)  Generally. Mobility improvements are transportation system improvements that enhance alternative modes of transportation by providing context-appropriate sidewalks, bikeways, transit facilities, parking management or appropriate roadway improvements that will contribute to specific and identified mobility needs within the city. These standards promote sustainable development patterns and livable neighborhoods while supporting the formation of complete streets. All proposed mobility improvements will require prior city staff approval. 
(b)  Requirements. Development and redevelopment projects issued a final development order after May 28, 2013, within mobility districts must provide mobility improvements to enhance the functionality of the transportation system. The number of required mobility improvements will be determined by the amount of new motor vehicle trips generated by the development or redevelopment project. Mobility improvements will be provided, at the developer's or property owner's expense, based on the development's trip generation and proportional impact on roadway facilities. A traffic analysis impact study, as defined in section 3.02, appendix D of city code, must be prepared and submitted to the city at the developer's/property owner's expense to determine the impacts of the development upon the transportation system, if the development is anticipated to generate more than three percent of the threshold level of service for a particular roadway. 
(c)  Procedure. A developer or property owner may choose to provide one or more mobility improvement off-site with the city's approval. The mobility improvement chosen will be subject to the final approval of the city during the plan approval process. Mobility improvements, both as to the type of improvement provided and as to the amount or degree of improvement provided, must have a rational nexus to the particular development or redevelopment site, transportation conditions, special characteristics, and needs of the specific area where the development or redevelopment is located. 
(1)  Thresholds. The following table displays the trip generation thresholds and the number of mobility improvements that must be provided by a developer or property owner: 
Net, new development 
average daily trip 
generation Number of mobility 
improvements which 
must be provided 0 to 9 Zero (0) 10 to 49 At least 1 mobility improvement 50 to 99 At least 3 mobility improvements 100 to 399 At least 5 mobility improvements 400 to 999 At least 7 mobility improvements 1,000 to 4,999 At least 12 mobility improvements 5,000 or greater At least 18 mobility improvements and either be on an existing transit route or provide funding for a new transit route.  
(2)  Mobility improvement. These required improvements will enhance and foster mobility through the provision of vehicular, pedestrian, and transit improvements, as identified in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan. Except as provided for in this code, the mobility improvements identified in the table below are to be furnished by all development and redevelopment projects within mobility district areas. 
(3)  Administration of mobility improvements. 
(A)  All mobility improvements to be employed to offset transportation impacts of a particular development or redevelopment must be approved by the community development director, with the assistance of the city engineer, during the development plan approval process. For the purposes of this section, improvements that are required pursuant to appendix B, article IX, sections 5 and 6, and appendix D, sections 8.5 and 8.6, city code, or an approved development order will also not be counted toward the required number or degree of mobility improvements. 
(B)  Certain mobility improvements may count as more than one MI since such improvements may enhance mobility and reduce congestion to a greater extent than less expensive improvements. This determination will be made on a case-by-case basis by the community development director in consultation with the city engineer. The range of minimum and maximum mobility improvement values is displayed in the table below. The value determination will be based on the following factors: the size and scale of the project, the scope of identified mobility improvements within the applicable mobility district area, multimodal impacts to the transportation network, and the degree of complete streets implementation within the mobility district. The following table identifies all required mobility improvements regardless of their financial impact:

(4)  Provision of mobility improvements. Mobility improvements must be provided according to the following schedule: 
(A)  Residential projects. All required mobility improvements will be completed at the expense of and by the developer or property owner of the development in conjunction with subdivision infrastructure and the issuance of a certificate of completion for the project. For projects with multiple phases the phasing of which is approved by the city, the required mobility improvement may be phased, and the mobility improvement primarily serving a particular phase must be completed by not later than the time of build out of the subdivision infrastructure and the issuance of a certificate of completion for the particular phase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the mobility improvements are required by an ordinance or city council approval of the overall project or included in a developer's agreement or a statutory development agreement, the timeline for construction and completion of the mobility improvement will be as provided in the ordinance, city council approval, or agreement; provided that the mobility improvement and timeline for construction and completion must be clearly defined in the ordinance, city council approval, or agreement and have prior approval by city staff. 
(B)  Nonresidential projects. For projects submitted as a site plan and subject to the requirements of article IX, appendix B, City Code, all required mobility improvements must be completed at the expense of and by the developer or property owner of the development prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. For projects submitted as a subdivision plat and subject to the requirements of chapter 8, appendix D, City Code, all required mobility improvements will be completed at the expense of and by the developer or property owner of the development in conjunction with subdivision infrastructure and the issuance of a certificate of completion for the project. For projects with multiple phases, the phasing of which is approved by the city, the required mobility improvements may be phased, and the mobility improvements primarily serving a particular phase must be completed by not later than the time of build out of the subdivision infrastructure and the issuance of a certificate of completion for the particular phase. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the mobility improvements are required by an ordinance or city council approval of the overall project or included in a developer's agreement or a statutory development agreement, the timeline for construction and completion of the mobility improvement will be as provided in the ordinance, city council approval, or agreement; provided that the mobility improvement and timeline for construction and completion must be clearly defined in the ordinance, city council approval, or agreement and have prior approval by city staff. 
(C)  Mobility improvements attributable to a particular development or redevelopment project may be provided within or outside of a mobility district; provided that there is a reasonable connection or rational nexus between the mobility improvement and the transportation improvement needs caused by the development or redevelopment project. 
(D)  With regard to each mobility improvement for each development or redevelopment, the city must make an individualized determination that demonstrates: 
1.  That there is rational nexus or reasonable connection between the legitimate state interest sought to be protected or promoted and the mobility improvement to be provided; 
2.  The degree of connection between the mobility improvement imposed and the projected impact of the proposed development are roughly proportional. The mobility improvement imposed must not only be roughly proportional both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development. 
The individualized determination must demonstrate the mobility improvement's rational nexus or reasonably connection both as to the nature and extent of the proposed development's impact. The city need not demonstrate that the mobility improvement is directly proportional to the specifically created need, only that the rational nexus or reasonable relationship is roughly proportional. 
(d)  Development of complete streets. 
(1)  Complete streets accommodate multiple users, regardless of age and abilities, including bicyclists, pedestrians, motorists, and transit users, while providing a safer and more efficient travel environment. All new street and roadway improvement projects in the city, both inside and outside of mobility districts, will be designed to maximize the integration of all transportation modes. In cases where a roadway corridor is primarily oriented to move vehicular traffic, the facility should still accommodate pedestrians. 
(2)  Within mobility districts, the development of complete streets will be achieved through the implementation of mobility improvements and through the construction of projects funded by payments in lieu of providing mobility improvements. The development of complete streets projects will further the implementation of the city's mobility strategies through the following measures: 
(A)  Include infrastructure that provides safe and convenient travel for multiple users, including but not limited to sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and transit facilities. The city will also work with the Space Coast Transportation Planning Organization, Brevard County, and the FDOT to implement complete streets standards on county and state roadways within the city. 
(B)  Incorporate street design features that promote safe and comfortable travel by pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit users. 
(C)  Provide safe and appropriately placed pedestrian crossings. 
(D)  Provide multimodal connections between residential areas, institutional uses, recreational facilities, public transportation, employment centers, and retail destinations. 
(e)  Moratorium for commercial and industrial uses. 
(1)  (A)  In order to establish an incentive for new development that will provide new jobs within the city, beginning on April 1, 2014 and ending July 31, 2016, the city council hereby establishes and imposes a two-year and four-month moratorium on the requirement that mobility improvements be provided by a project developer pursuant to this article on any commercial and industrial use development project which would otherwise be subject to the requirement to provide mobility improvements pursuant to this article. To be subject to this moratorium and to be exempt from the requirement of providing mobility improvements pursuant to this article for a specific type of development on a particular parcel of real property, a property owner, contractor, developer, or applicant must during the effective period of the moratorium submit a complete building permit application for construction of an expanded, new, or redeveloped commercial or industrial use as classified pursuant to this section (e)(1)(B) and submit either: (i) a complete construction plan approval application; (ii) written verification from the city engineer that a construction plan for the development project is under review by the city engineer; or (iii) written verification from the city engineer that approval of the construction plan has occurred and is unexpired and active. 
(B)  As used in subsection (e)(1)(A), the term "commercial or industrial use" includes but is not limited to retail commercial uses, professional office, restaurant, gasoline station, car wash, hotel, motel, medical/dental offices, banks, industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, but excludes residential, institutional and recreational uses. Commercial and industrial uses shall be determined by the community development director by considering the actual use of a proposed development project. 
(C)  If a building permit is issued during the moratorium and the permit remains active through extensions of active status granted after the expiration of the moratorium but legally issued by the building official (code compliance director), the moratorium shall continue to apply to the development permitted by the building permit. If a complete building permit application is submitted along with either a complete construction plan approval application, verification that a construction plan for the development project is under review by the city engineer, or verification that approval of the construction plan has occurred and is unexpired and active, during the moratorium, and the applications are actively maintained and pursued to approval in good faith, but a building permit is not issued to the property owner, contractor, developer, or other applicant until after the expiration of the moratorium, the moratorium shall be applicable to the development described in the complete building permit application and the complete construction plan application or approval. 
(D)  If a property owner, contractor, developer, or other applicant fails to submit a complete building permit application and either a complete construction plan application, verification that a construction plan for the development project is under review by the city engineer, or verification that approval of the construction plan has occurred and is unexpired and active, all during the effective dates of the moratorium, for construction of an expanded, new, or redeveloped commercial or industrial use as classified pursuant to this section of the code, then the aforesaid property owner, contractor, developer, or other applicant's development project will not be subject to the mobility improvement moratorium provided by this subsection (e), and all requirements of this article for provision of mobility improvements must be satisfied by said development project. 
(E)  This subsection is applicable to development projects for the time period of the moratorium which development projects are being developed pursuant to a development or developer's agreement between the city and a property owner or developer of the development project identified in the agreement; provided that in the case of a development or developer's agreement which contains specific provisions requiring the provision or installation of specified mobility improvements this subsection will not apply. 
(F)  No capacity reservation deposit for transportation concurrency required to be assessed pursuant to this chapter will be levied against any commercial or industrial development project, for which a complete building permit application and a complete construction plan application, verification that a construction plan for the development project is under review by the city engineer, or verification that approval of the construction plan has occurred and is unexpired and active, is submitted during the effective dates of the moratorium provided for by this subsection, or for which a building permit is issued for a commercial or industrial project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transportation concurrency evaluation and a reservation of transportation concurrency will be required as otherwise provided for in this chapter. 
(2)  To be a complete building permit application, as set forth in this section, a property owner, contractor, developer, or applicant must submit:

This payment must be at least equal to the amount of transportation impact fees required pursuant to section 10.04, appendix D, of the City Code. Fifty percent of the payment in lieu amount will be placed in a reserve fund for the construction of mobility projects listed in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan or for the development of complete streets projects identified in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan. The remaining 50 percent of the payment amount will be deposited into the transportation impact fee trust fund and used in accordance with section 10.07, appendix D, of the city code. 
(b)  Required deposit. If a developer or property owner chooses to make a payment in lieu of providing mobility improvements, a mobility improvements deposit, equal to a percentage of the transportation impact fees that would be required per section 10.04, appendix D, city code, will be required within 90 days of site plan, preliminary plat, or final plat approval. The amount of this deposit will be determined annually by adoption of a resolution by the city council, based upon current economic and market conditions. This deposit will be placed in reserve for the construction of mobility projects. Final payment of the remaining balance will be due at the time a building permit is issued by the city. 
For residential and commercial subdivisions, payment is due as building permits are issued for each individual lot. The amount paid for each lot shall be dependent upon the development that occurs on said lot. The amount paid for a residential subdivision project should equal the payment in lieu of providing mobility improvements amount determined at preliminary plat, construction plan or final plat approval for the overall project. 
(c)  Combination of options. A developer or property owner can choose to provide a combination of mobility improvements and payment in lieu of construction. This option allows a property owner/developer to construct a specific number of mobility improvements while providing a payment in lieu of construction for the remaining improvements required by section 3.102(c)(1). This option will be evaluated on a case by case basis and must be approved in advance by the community development director in consultation with the city engineer. If a developer chooses this option, the payment in lieu of construction amount must be equal to the difference between the total cost of the mobility improvements and the amount of transportation impact fees required pursuant to section 10.04, appendix D, of the City Code. 
For residential and commercial subdivisions, an applicant must receive approval for the construction of mobility improvements at the time of preliminary plat or construction plan approval. The developer can choose to apply the monetary value of constructed mobility improvements to a specific lot (or lots), or the developer can choose to evenly distribute the value over the total number of lots in the subdivision. Revisions and/or modifications to development orders may alter the number of required mobility improvements. 
(d)  Moratorium for commercial and industrial uses. 
(1)  (A)  In order to establish an incentive for new development that will provide new jobs within the city, beginning on April 1, 2014 and ending July 31, 2016, the city council hereby establishes and imposes a two-year and four-month moratorium on the levy and assessment of mobility fees in lieu of providing mobility improvements pursuant to this article on any commercial and industrial use development project which would otherwise be subject to the requirement to provide mobility improvements or payment of mobility fees in lieu of providing the required mobility improvements pursuant to this article. To be subject to this moratorium and to be exempt from the requirement of paying a mobility fee in lieu of providing mobility improvements for a specific type of development on a particular parcel of real property, a property owner, contractor, developer, or applicant must during the effective period of the moratorium submit a complete building permit application for construction of an expanded, new, or redeveloped commercial or industrial use as classified pursuant to this section (d)(1)(B) and submit either: (i) a complete construction plan approval application; (ii) written verification from the city engineer that a construction plan for the development project is under review by the city engineer; or (iii) written verification from the city engineer that approval of the construction plan has occurred and is unexpired or active. 
(B)  As used in subsection (d)(1)(A), the term "commercial or industrial use" includes but is not limited to retail commercial uses, professional office, restaurant, gasoline station, car wash, hotel, motel, medical/dental offices, banks, industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, but excludes residential, institutional and recreational uses. Commercial and industrial uses shall be determined by the community development director by considering the actual use of a proposed development project. 
(C)  If a building permit is issued during the moratorium and the permit remains active through extensions of active status granted after the expiration of the moratorium but legally issued by the building official (code compliance director), the moratorium shall continue to apply to the development permitted by the building permit. If a complete building permit application is submitted along with either a complete construction plan approval application, verification that a construction plan for the development project is under review by the city engineer, or verification that approval of the construction plan has occurred and is unexpired and active, during the moratorium, and the applications are actively maintained and pursued to approval in good faith, but a building permit is not issued to the property owner, contractor, developer, or other applicant until after the expiration of the moratorium, the moratorium shall be applicable to the development described in the complete building permit application and the complete construction plan application or approval. 
(D)  If a property owner, contractor, developer, or other applicant fails to submit a complete building permit application and either a complete construction plan application, verification that a construction plan for the development project is under review by the city engineer, or verification that approval of the construction plan has occurred and is unexpired and active, all during the effective dates of the moratorium, for construction of an expanded, new, or redeveloped commercial or industrial use as classified pursuant to this section of the code, then the aforesaid property owner, contractor, developer, or other applicant's development project will not be subject to the moratorium on the payment of mobility fees in lieu of providing mobility improvements provided by this subsection (d), and all requirements of this article for payment of mobility fees in lieu of the provision of mobility improvements must be satisfied by said development project. 
(E)  This subsection is applicable to development projects for the time period of the moratorium which development projects are being developed pursuant to a development or developer's agreement between the city and a property owner or developer of the development project identified in the agreement; provided that in the case of a development or developer's agreement which contains specific provisions requiring the provision or installation of specified mobility improvements this subsection will not apply. 
(F)  No capacity reservation deposit for transportation concurrency required to be assessed pursuant to this chapter will be levied against any commercial or industrial development project, for which a complete building permit application and a complete construction plan application, verification that a construction plan for the development project is under review by the city engineer, or verification that approval of the construction plan has occurred and is unexpired and active, is submitted during the effective dates of the moratorium provided for by this subsection, or for which a building permit is issued for a commercial or industrial project. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transportation concurrency evaluation and a reservation of transportation concurrency will be required as otherwise provided for in this chapter.

Sec. 3.104. - Mobility districts trust fund. 
(a)  Creation of a mobility district trust fund. The payment in lieu fees collected by the city will be held in a separate trust for expenditure for mobility improvements in a particular mobility district. The funds will be kept separate from other revenue of the city. There will be one fund established for the five mobility districts. The mobility districts are described within the mobility plan and on Map III-9 within the transportation element of the comprehensive plan. The boundaries of the districts are further defined below. 
(b)  Creation of mobility districts. The districts are depicted on Map III-9 of the transportation element of the comprehensive plan and are generally defined as follows: 
Mobility District A : This mobility district encompasses the major employment centers in the vicinity of the airport and includes such roadways as Sarno Road, U.S. 1, Apollo Boulevard, U.S. 192, NASA Boulevard, Hibiscus Boulevard, and Wickham Road. 
Mobility District B: An area that encompasses the Downtown Community Redevelopment Area (CRA), the Olde Eau Gallie CRA, and the Babcock CRA, including such roads as U.S. 1, U.S. 192, Babcock Street, and Eau Gallie Boulevard. This area also includes the U.S. 1/Sarno Road, U.S. 1/Babcock Street, U.S. 1/NASA Boulevard, and U.S. 1/U.S. 192 intersections.

Mobility District E: This district encompasses the section of Wickham Road from the Pineda Causeway south to Aurora Road. The district encompasses the Wickham Road/Post Road intersection, the Parkway Drive/Wickham Road intersection, and the Lake Washington Road/Wickham Road intersection. 
(c)  Expenditure of funds collected. Mobility fees must be expended on projects listed in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan or on complete streets projects identified in either the transportation or capital improvements elements of the comprehensive plan or in the Space Coast Transportation Planning Organization's Transportation Improvement Program. Funds collected in a mobility district may also be used in an adjacent district if the proposed project creates mobility impacts that are common to both mobility districts. 
(d)  Disbursal of funds. Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used solely in accordance with the provisions of this section. The disbursal of such funds will require the approval of the city council. 
(e)  Interest on funds. Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure will be invested in interest-bearing accounts. All income derived will be deposited in the applicable trust account. 
(f)  Return of funds. The payment in lieu fees collected pursuant to this section will be returned to the then present owner of the development if the fees have not been encumbered or spent by the end of the six-year period from the date the fees were received in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  The then present owner must petition the city manager for the refund within 90 days following the end of the six years from the date on which the fee was received. 
(2)  The petition must be submitted to the city manager and must contain: 
(A)  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the property from which the impact fee was assessed; 
(B)  a copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee; 
(C)  a certified copy of the latest recorded deed showing ownership of the property from which the impact fee was assessed; and 
(D)  a copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill for the property from which the impact fee was assessed. 
(3)  Within 60 days from the date of receipt of the petition for refund, the city manager will make a rendition of a determination whether a refund will be made, advising the petitioner of the determination. For the purposes of determining whether fees have been spent or encumbered, the first money placed in a trust fund account will be deemed to be the first money taken out of that account when withdrawals have been made in accordance with this subsection. 
(4)  When the money requested is still in the trust fund account and has not been spent or encumbered by the end of the six years from the date the fees were paid, the money will be returned with interest at the rate of interest earned by the city during the six-year period. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 5(3.104), 5-28-2013; Ord. No. 2014-12, § 4(3.104), 1-28-2014) 
Sec. 3.105. - Exemptions. 
(a)  The following shall be exempt from providing mobility improvements pursuant to this chapter of City Code: 
(1)  Any building or structure owned by any federal, state, county, or local governmental entity and intended to be utilized for governmental purposes. Governmentally owned property leased for non-governmental purposes shall not be included within this exemption. 
(2)  Alterations of an existing structure with no increase in gross floor area (GFA). 
(3)  The construction of an accessory use or accessory structures. 
(4)  The replacement of a building, not to exceed the GFA of the existing building provided that the land use remains unchanged. If the land use type of the replacement building is different from the land use type of the existing building, the applicant shall receive credit for the trips generated by the existing use. The number of mobility improvements to be provided will be based upon the difference in trip generation between the new and existing uses (the number of trips generated by the new use minus the number of trips generated by the existing use). If the calculation demonstrates the new use results in less trip generation than the existing use, then zero mobility improvements will be required irrespective of any increase in GFA. The payment in lieu of amount shall also reflect credit for GFA of the existing use. The GFA figure for the payment in lieu of amount shall be calculated as follows: new GFA minus existing GFA. 
(5)  The replacement or enlargement of a building, not to exceed an increase of 50 percent of the GFA of the existing building if it is located in a community redevelopment area, and provided that the land use remains unchanged. If the land use type of the replacement building is different from the land use type of the existing building, the applicant shall receive credit for up to 150 percent of the trips generated by the existing use. The number of mobility improvements to be provided will be based upon the difference in trip generation between the new and existing uses (the number of trips generated by the new use minus the number of trips generated by the existing use). If the calculation demonstrates the new use results in less trip generation than the existing use, then zero mobility improvements will be required irrespective of any increase in GFA. The payment in lieu of amount shall also reflect credit for the GFA of the existing use. The GFA figure for the payment in lieu of amount shall be calculated as follows: new GFA minus existing GFA. 
(6)  An exemption may only be applied to a replacement or enlargement building located on substantially the same lot as the existing building. The exemption will only be applicable to a replacement building if its building permit is issued within five years of the issuance of the demolition permit for the original building. Exemptions or enlargement of a building pursuant to this subsection will be limited to buildings that received a certificate of occupancy at least five years prior to expansion and shall not include phased projects; separate principal buildings on the same parcel of land; or additional buildings which were part of a unified site plan. 
(Ord. No. 2014-12, § 6(3.105), 1-28-2014) 
Sec. 3.106. - Deferral of payment. 
(a)  An owner or applicant for a nonresidential or mixed use project within the city may request to defer the payment in lieu providing mobility improvements fee until the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, if such project will create jobs. 
(b)  The creation of jobs may be temporary construction jobs and at least two permanent jobs that would be located within the new development. 
(c)  The request to defer payment shall be administered by the community development director, or his or her designee, upon receipt of a statement indicating the number of permanent and temporary jobs created. 
(Ord. No. 2014-12, § 6(3.106), 1-28-2014) 
Sec. 3.107. - Appeals. 
(a)  Interpretation of mobility improvement provisions. All questions of interpretation regarding the provision of mobility improvements, as embodied in this article X, of chapter 3, appendix D, will be first presented to the community development director. In interpreting this article X, chapter 3, appendix D, City Code, the community development director, with the assistance of the city engineer, will be first guided by the plain meaning of the words and terms in this article X, chapter 3, appendix D, City Code, and second by the intent expressed therein. The community development director will make interpretations by interpreting the Code as a whole and not by taking specific words or clauses in isolation. Any interpretation will be subject to rendition in a written, dated form. Thereafter, the zoning board of adjustment will decide appeals filed by an aggrieved party where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the community development director in interpreting this code. 
(b)  Decisions that may be appealed. Appeals may be taken to the zoning board of adjustment based upon any of the following decisions: 
(1)  Interpretation by the community development director of the meaning of wording in appendix D, relating mobility districts and mobility improvements; sections 3.101 through 3.105, 10.01, 10.02, 10.04, and 10.07, appendix D, relating to mobility districts and mobility improvements; all in the City Code; 
(2)  A determination regarding the weighted value of an applicable mobility improvement pursuant to section 3.102, appendix D; 
(3)  A determination by the economic development director as to the deposit calculations pursuant to section 3.103 (a) and section 3.103 (b), appendix D; 
(4)  A determination as to the assessment of transportation impact fees that must be paid if a developer or property owner elects to provide some mobility improvements and some impact fees pursuant to sections 3.103 and 10.01, appendix D of this code; 
(5)  Interpretation by the community development director with regard to the use classification of a particular development project pursuant to this article (e.g., whether the development is an industrial or commercial project); or 
(6)  Interpretation by the community development director of the application of this article to a particular development project. 
(c)  Appeals; by whom taken. Appeals may be taken only by a person aggrieved, the city council or the city manager. A person aggrieved by a decision includes any property owner, applicant, developer or other person: subject to providing a mobility improvement, or paying a fee in lieu of providing a mobility improvement, for a development project which said person claims was improperly determined by the city; subject to provision of a mobility improvement, or paying a fee in lieu thereof, which said person claims was improperly calculated by the city or which use was classified pursuant to this code and is alleged to have been improperly classified; receiving disapproval of a proposed mobility improvement; claiming a right to a mobility improvement or mobility fee exemption, credit, or moratorium, which was disapproved by the city; or claiming an error or improper determination with regard to said aggrieved person's interests or affecting said aggrieved person's interests, in making interpretations pursuant to subsection (b). A person aggrieved also includes any person affected differently than the balance of the remainder of the city or to a greater degree than the balance of the remainder of the city. The city is designated as an aggrieved party pursuant to this section. 
(d)  Method of appeal. Appeals to the zoning board of adjustment must be made within a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days following the date of rendition of the interpretation or other determination as set forth in subsection (b) above by filing with the official making the determination, and with the secretary to the zoning board of adjustment, a notice of appeal specifying the ground thereof. The official making the determination will within 15 days thereafter transmit to the zoning board of adjustment all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The secretary to the zoning board of adjustment within 60 days after receipt of the record will fix a time for hearing of the appeal and give public notice thereof at least 15 days in advance of the public hearing as well as notice to the parties in interest. Thereafter, the zoning board of adjustment will hear and decide said appeal within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent, or be represented by an attorney-at-law.

Sec. 4.05. - Legal status of comprehensive plan.

(b)  Conflicts with other regulations. The comprehensive plan is cumulative and supplemental to existing city regulations for the development of land. Where the comprehensive plan conflicts with existing land development regulations, the comprehensive plan shall supersede existing land development regulations to the effect of the conflict until such existing land development regulations are amended to be consistent with the comprehensive plan.

Sec. 4.10. - City council review 
(a)  The city council shall review minor amendments in accordance with F.S. § 163.3187. In general, minor amendments do not have to be reviewed pursuant to this section. However, the city council may require minor amendments to go through the major amendment process if it has been determined that going through the major amendment review process will promote the public health, safety, welfare, economic order, or aesthetics of the community. The annual update to the capital improvements element does not have to be reviewed pursuant to this section. 
(b)  For major amendments, the city council shall hold at least two public hearings in accordance with F.S. § 163.3184. 
At the first public hearing, the only question before the city council shall be whether or not to approve the proposed amendment for transmittal to the state land planning agency. The city council shall encourage and accept oral and written comments from the applicant and all interested parties, all of which shall be made a part of the official record of the public hearing. If a question regarding the proposed amendment to the comprehensive plan is raised by a member of the public at any time prior to or during the public hearing which cannot be answered by either the city council, the city manager, legal counsel, or the community development director at the hearing, the community development director shall respond in writing. Failure of the community development director to respond to the question raised shall not be a basis upon which any person may seek to invalidate a subsequently adopted amendment to the comprehensive plan. The report of the community development director and the local planning agency/planning and zoning board, letters or other written communications received by the city administration, and any written comments entered into the record during the board public hearing, all regarding any pending application for amendment of the comprehensive plan, shall be made a part of the record during the city council public hearing.

(2)  If an application is approved or approved with modification for transmittal to the state land planning agency, the proposal shall be immediately forwarded by the community development director to the state land planning agency for review. 
(d)  Second public hearing by city council. During the public hearing, all comments received from the state land planning agency, together with comments from all reviewing agencies, shall be made a part of the record. The city council shall encourage and accept oral and written comments from the applicant or the applicant's agent or attorney, the city administration, all reviewing agencies, other governmental entities, and the general public, all of which shall be made a part of the record of the public hearing. Letters and other written communications received by the city after the first city council public hearing shall be made a part of the record. If a question regarding a proposed amendment to the comprehensive plan is raised by a member of the public at any time prior to or during the public hearing, either the city council, the city manager, legal counsel, or the community development director shall attempt to respond to the question. Failure to respond shall not be a basis upon which any person may seek to invalidate a subsequently adopted amendment to the comprehensive plan. The sole question at the public hearing shall be whether to approve, deny, or otherwise modify and adopt the proposed plan amendment. In no event shall the city council approve an amendment that permits a land use more intense or more dense than the proposal forwarded to the state land planning agency. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, industrial or commercial uses shall be viewed as being more intense than any residential land use density. Upon final action by the city council, the applicant shall be advised in writing within 30 calendar days of the final decision.

The city manager, or the city manager's designee, shall make interpretations by interpreting this chapter or the comprehensive plan as a whole and not by taking specific words or clauses in isolation. Thereafter, the city council, after review by the local planning agency/planning and zoning board, shall have the authority to hear and decide appeals from the city manager, or the city manager's designee, where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the city manager, or the city manager's designee, in interpreting this chapter or the comprehensive plan.

Such appeal shall be filed no later than 30 days following the date of rendition of the interpretation. An appeal is initiated by filing with the city manager and with the secretary to the local planning agency/planning and zoning board a notice of appeal specifying the interpretation appealed from and a description of the reasons why the interpretation is in error. The city manager shall within 15 days thereafter, transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. A fee may be charged for said appeal, said fee being an amount fixed from time to time by resolution of the city council.

Within 60 days of the date the local planning agency/planning and zoning board has forwarded its recommended order to the city manager, the city council shall hold a hearing on the appeal. Within 45 days after the hearing on the appeal, the city council shall vote on and thereafter file its final order with the city clerk, dispatching a copy to the city manager, and mailing or otherwise delivering a copy by regular first class U.S. mail, postage prepaid on the appellant. 
(f)  Stay of proceeding. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the city manager, or the city manager's designee, certifies to the board and the city council after the notice of appeal is filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the city manager's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the city council or by a court of record on application.

ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND INTENT 

Sec. 5.01. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to explain the procedure for annexation and contraction into/from the City of Melbourne and the criteria used to evaluate each application. In addition to the standards and application presented herein, all annexation or contraction shall comply with F.S. ch. 171. 
(Ord. No. 99-22, § 3, 5-25-1999) 
Sec. 5.02. - Definitions 
(a)  "Annexation" means the adding of real property to the boundaries of an incorporated municipality, such addition making such real property in every way a part of the municipality. 
(b)  "Available publicly owned or investor-owned sewerage system" means a publicly owned or investor-owned sewerage system that is capable of being connected to the plumbing of an establishment or residence so long as: 
(1)  The sewerage system is not under a department of environmental protection moratorium; 
(2)  The sewerage system has adequate permitted capacity to accept the sewage to be generated by the establishment or residence; 
(3)  For a single-family residence, or for an establishment that has an estimated sewage flow of 1,000 gallons per day or less, a sewer line exists in a public easement or right-of-way that abuts the property of the establishment or residence and gravity flow can be naturally or artificially maintained from the establishment's or residence's drain to the sewer line; 
(4)  For estimated sewage flows exceeding 1,000 gallons per day, with the exception of a single-family residence, a sewer line, force main, or lift station exists in a public easement or right-of-way that abuts the property of the establishment and is within 50 feet of the property line of the establishment as accessed via existing rights-of-way or easements; and 
(5)  For areas zoned or used for an industrial or manufacturing purpose or its equivalent, a sewerage system exists within one-fourth mile of the development as measured and accessed via existing easements or rights-of-way, and, for repair or modification of these areas, a sewerage system exists within 500 feet of an establishment's or residence's sewer stub-out as accessed via existing rights-of-way or easements. 
(c)  "Contraction" means the reversion of real property within municipal boundaries to an unincorporated status. 
(d)  "Municipality" means a municipality created pursuant to general or special law authorized or recognized pursuant to s.2 or s.6, article VIII of the state constitution. 
(e)  "City services" means any services offered by a municipality, either directly or by contract, to any of its present residents. 
(f)  "Contiguous" means that a part other than a point or property corner of a boundary of the territory sought to be annexed by a municipality is coterminous with a part of the boundary of the municipality. The separation of the territory sought to be annexed from the annexing municipality by a publicly owned county park; a right-of-way for a highway, road, railroad, canal, or utility; or a body of water, watercourse, or other minor geographical division of a similar nature, running parallel with and between the territory sought to be annexed and the annexing municipality, shall not prevent annexation under this act, provided the presence of such a division does not, as a practical matter, prevent the territory sought to be annexed and the annexing municipality from becoming a unified whole with respect to municipal services or prevent their inhabitants from fully associating and trading with each other, socially and economically. However, nothing herein shall be construed to allow local rights-of-way, utility easements, railroad rights-of-way, or like entities to be annexed in a corridor fashion to gain contiguity; and when any provision or provisions of special law or laws prohibit the annexation of territory that is separated from the annexing municipality by a body of water or watercourse, then that law shall prevent annexation under this act. 
(g)  "Compact" means concentration of a piece of property in a single area and precludes any action which would create permanent enclaves, pockets, or finger areas in serpentine patterns. Any annexation proceeding in any county in the state shall be designed in such a manner as to ensure that the area will be reasonably compact. 
(h)  "Enclave" means: 
(1)  Any unincorporated improved or developed area that is enclosed within and bounded on all sides by a single municipality; or 
(2)  Any unincorporated improved or developed area that is enclosed within and bounded by a single municipality and a natural or manmade obstacle that allows the passage of vehicular traffic to that unincorporated area only through the municipality.

Based on evidence and standards, the city council may approve, approve with conditions or deny the annexation ordinance. 
(f)  Upon approval of the annexation, the applicant shall automatically incur an obligation to indicate a proposed future land use designation and zoning classification if this has not been done simultaneously with the annexation. 
(g)  If an application for annexation of property into the city includes a definite plan of development, the city may agree to reduce impact fees to not less than the total impact fee, including water and sewer hook-up or connection fees applicable in the county, that would have been charged if the development had occurred in the unincorporated area.

(2)  Issuance of building permits on unrecorded plat: Two building permits for single-family model homes, one building permit for a multiple-family building, and one permit for a commercial/industrial building may be issued by the building official prior to final plat approval in a proposed subdivision if: 
a.  A preliminary plat has been approved; 
b.  Construction plans have been approved; 
c.  The portion of the unrecorded plat on which the building is to be located must meet all requirements of City Code, including meeting the definition of a "lot" as set forth in section 8.4; 
d.  Improvements have been completed which provide fire service and fire access including a stabilized road and water service to the area where the models will be located; and 
e.  Any other improvement that the city building official or city engineer deem necessary for safety. No certificate of occupancy (CO) or certificate of completion shall be issued, nor shall any additional permits for construction of residential, commercial or industrial units be issued, unless and until: i) a final plat is recorded by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Brevard County for the section of the project in which the CO is requested; and ii) all subdivision improvements and related requirements have been completed and approved by the city engineer for the section of the project where the CO is requested. 
(3)  Final plat approval procedure. The procedure for obtaining final plat approval is as follows: 
a.  The subdivider shall submit to the community development director an original Mylar, one reproducible copy and 12 black or blueline prints of the final plat. 
Failure to commence construction of site improvements or to file an application for final plat approval within one year of the preliminary plat approval or any extension granted by the city council upon written request by the subdivider, shall result in the preliminary plat approval expiring and being automatically terminated. 
b.  At the time of submission of the final plat, the subdivider shall pay to the city, a fee as prescribed from time to time by resolution of the city council. The final plat shall be properly signed and executed by the subdivider and his surveyor and joined in and consented to by all lienholders, all in the form as required for recording by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Brevard County.

Where the required improvements have not been completed prior to the submission of the final plat, the approval of the plat shall be subject to the subdivider, guaranteeing the installation of said improvements by filing a performance and payment bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the State by the Florida Insurance Commissioner; tri-party agreement; or a letter of credit issued by a Florida bank or savings and loan association, located in the state and licensed by the federal government or the State of Florida Comptroller to do business in Florida as a bank or savings and loan association in the amount of 110 percent of the construction cost, including fill dirt, as determined by the city engineer. The bond instrument may provide that portions of the security may be partially released, proportionate to the work completed, to the subdivider, from time to time, as work progresses; but the amount to be released shall be determined by the city engineer in accordance with the foregoing. All instruments shall be in form and substance satisfactory to and approved by the city attorney. 
c.  Every plat of a subdivision submitted to the approving agency of the city must be accompanied by a title opinion by an attorney-at-law licensed to practice in the state or a certification by an abstractor or a title insurance company, authorized to do business as such by the Florida Insurance Commissioner, confirming that record title to the land as described and shown on the plat is in the name of the person, corporation, or legal entity executing the dedication, if any, as it is shown on the plat and, if the plat does not contain a dedication, that the subdivider has record title to the land. The title opinion or certification shall also show all mortgages or other liens not satisfied nor otherwise terminated by law on the land to be platted and all other encumbrances or easements. The title opinion shall be certified to and in favor of the City of Melbourne and the Brevard County Clerk of the Circuit Court. Said opinion shall be in form and substance acceptable to the city attorney. No title opinion shall be more than 90 days old as of the date of recording of the final plat. As of the date of recording of the final plat, the subdivider shall certify under oath to and for reliance by the city and the clerk of the circuit court that there have been no changes in the state of title as depicted on the title opinion. 
d.  Any proposed subdivision within a flood hazard area must comply with sections 13.191 through 13.198, appendix D, of this code. If proposed structure elevations are contingent upon a letter of map change as defined in section 13.152, appendix D of the code of ordinances, no certificates of occupancy (CO) shall be issued for a structure on any platted lot formerly located in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated flood zone A, AE, AO, AH, V, or VE until a map amendment or letter of map revision (LOMR) has been obtained for said lot or structure indicating that such structure has been removed from a special flood hazard area as acknowledged by FEMA as a result of construction improvements. All lots where no change in the status of the special flood hazard area has occurred shall remain eligible for building permits provided that the lowest floor elevation is elevated 1.33 feet above the base flood elevation. All construction must comply with article IX, chapter 13, appendix D, City Code, and no building permit or permit for subdivision improvements will be issued until the construction has been approved by the city's floodplain administrator pursuant to article IX, chapter 13, appendix D, City Code. 
e.

Upon review and approval of the documents, the documents shall be recorded in the Public Records of Brevard County, Florida, simultaneous with the recordation of the final plat: 
1.  Articles of incorporation for a homeowner's, property owner's, or condominium association, if the property to be platted includes more than one parcel of property to be platted. The community development director may waive this requirement at the time of final plat approval, if there are no private improvements serving more than one lot. The articles of incorporation shall satisfy all requirements of either F.S. chs. 607 or 617, relating to corporations. The articles of incorporation shall include a provision stating that the city is not required to take title to or to operate any of the improvements in the subdivision upon dissolution of the association. The provision shall also provide that said provision cannot be amended or terminated without consent of the city. Upon approval of the articles of incorporation, they shall be filed with the State of Florida, Secretary of State at the expense of the subdivider. Prior to recording of the final plat, copies of the corporate charter and articles of incorporation marked "Filed" in the Secretary of State's office shall be submitted to the community development director. It is recommended, although not required by the city, that the original corporate charter and articles of incorporation marked "Filed" in the Secretary of State's office be recorded in the public records of Brevard County, Florida, simultaneous with the recordation of the final plat; 
2.  Declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions for the subdivision, if the property to be platted includes more than one parcel of property to be platted. This document shall include provisions providing: that the covenants shall be covenants running with the land; that the common areas are subject to the jurisdiction of the association incorporated above in sub-paragraph f.1; that the association shall be responsible for maintenance of the common areas; that the association shall have the power to assess the various lots in the subdivision for funds to maintain the common areas, and that upon failure to pay said assessments, the association may place a lien against said lots; restrictions on use of portions of the property to be subdivided; and for a method by which the covenants and restrictions may be enforced. The covenants and restrictions shall continue in force for so long as the subdivision may exist. The common areas shall include entry areas for landscaping and display of subdivision related signage, stormwater retention/detention facilities, drainage easements, recreational areas, and other subdivision related facilities, and may include conservation areas; 
3.  Deed conveying parcels of the common areas to the association incorporated above in subparagraph f.1. The deed shall be a statutory warranty deed; 
4.  Easements to the city for water, sewer, drainage, conservation, or other purposes, whether on- or off-site. No easement shall be conveyed unless requested by the city. All easements shall warrant title, that the grantor holds title to the property and has the power to convey title, and that the grantor will defend the city against all claims against the title; 
5.  Stormwater maintenance agreement substantially conforming to the form approved by the city; 
6.  Water or sewer agreements required as a condition of construction plan approval;

The instruments set forth in subparagraphs f.1.-5. shall be joined in and consented to by mortgagees and lienholders of record at the time of recording of the final plat. All documents must be in form and substance acceptable to the city manager and city attorney. All costs for recording, documentary stamp taxes, and other applicable taxes and fees shall be paid by the subdivider. 
g.  Installation of permanent reference monument and permanent reference points. Upon approval of the final plat by the city council, but prior to the recording of the final plat the subdivider shall cause a registered surveyor to install permanent reference monument (P.R.M.) points. Permanent reference monument points shall be placed in accordance with the following requirements: 
1.  Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker, such as a U.S. government marker, section corner or quarter-section corner. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some pertinent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure. 
2.  Permanent reference monuments. Permanent reference monuments shall be placed at each corner or change in direction on the boundary of the lands being platted; however, "P.R.M.s" need not be set closer than 310 feet, but shall not be more than 1,400 feet apart. In all cases, there shall be a minimum of four "P.R.M.s" placed on the boundary of the lands being platted. Additional "P.R.M.s" shall be placed by the subdivider where required by the city engineer. Where such corners are in an inaccessible place, "P.R.M.s" shall be set on a nearby offset with the boundary of the plat, and such offset shall be noted on the plat. Where corners are found to coincide with a previously set "P.R.M.," the number on the previously set "P.R.M." shall be shown on the new plat or, if unnumbered, shall so state. Permanent reference monuments shall be set before the recording of the plat, and this will be so stated in the surveyor's certificate on the plat. Such "P.R.M." shall be shown on the plat by an appropriate designation. 
3.  Permanent control points. "P.C.P.s" shall be set at the intersection of the centerline of the right-of-way at the intersection of all streets, at "P.C.s," "P.T.s," "P.R.C.s" and "P.C.C.s" and no more than 1,000 feet apart, on a tangent, between changes of direction, or along the street right-of-way or block lines at each change in direction, no more than 1,000 feet apart. Such "P.C.P.s" shall be shown on the plat by an appropriate designation. "P.C.P.s" shall be set prior to the expiration of the bond or other surety or guarantee insuring the installation of subdivision improvements. It is the land surveyor's responsibility to furnish the city engineer with said surveyor's certificate that the "P.C.P.s" have been set and the dates the "P.C.P.s" were set. 
4.  Accuracy. The angular error of closure for surveys shall not exceed 25 seconds times the square root of the number of angles turned. The total error shall be no greater than 40 seconds. The linear error of closure for surveys shall not exceed one foot per 7,500 feet measured on the perimeter (1:7500). 
h.  Recording of the final plat. Within 90 days after the final plat has been approved by the city council, it shall be recorded with the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Brevard County by the applicant unless such recording within 90 days is prevented by some legal regulation or requirement of the clerk of the circuit court, in which case, the recording shall be accomplished as soon as the subdivider has satisfied such regulation or requirement. If the subdivider fails to satisfy all requirements of approval which are a condition precedent to recording the final plat and fails to record the plat within 90 days following city council approval, the final plat approval shall automatically terminate, unless the foregoing time is extended by the city council for good cause. Filing of a lawsuit or other administrative action within said 90 day period shall automatically stay the aforesaid time period. 
(Ord. No. 2004-74, § 1, 10-12-2004; Ord. No. 2006-79, § 12, 8-8-2006; Ord. No. 2009-31, § 13, 8-25-2009; Ord. No. 2013-02, § 80(8.5), 1-22-2013; Ord. No. 2016-19, § 1, 4-12-2016) 
Sec. 8.6. - Required improvements. 
(a)  Minimum standards of design; plans and drawings. The design of the preliminary plat and final construction drawings, shall comply with the requirements herein. Approval of the final plat shall be subject to the subdivider's having installed the improvements hereinafter designated or having guaranteed, with bond or other surety as aforesaid, the installation of the improvements. The city engineer shall be responsible for approving all plans and specifications, for the required improvements, assuring adequate inspection of construction for compliance with the approved plans and specifications and for issuing a certificate of completion upon the acceptable completion of the work and installation of the improvements, subject to the required maintenance period. All plans shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer sealed by said engineer, and certified to and in favor of the City of Melbourne. All improvements shall be constructed by the applicants and inspected by the city engineering division. All construction and inspection shall comply with the requirements of the city and state and federal agencies including, but not limited to, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Florida Department of Transportation, and the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Upon completion of the streets, stormwater systems, water, sewer, and reclaimed water systems, electric, gas, telephone utilities, and traffic control devices, acceptable to the city engineer, the city engineer may issue a certificate of substantial completion. This certificate does not certify completion of all improvements in the subdivision and is considered as a conditional certificate of completion. After completion of construction of all improvements and preliminary acceptance by the city engineer, the subdivider shall provide reproducible as-built drawings to the city for the purpose of maintaining a permanent record. Said drawings shall be prepared by State of Florida land surveyor and certified by a State of Florida professional engineer, under seal, certified to and in favor of the city. The certificate of completion shall not be issued until the drawings are delivered to and approved by the city engineer. The certificate of completion shall also signify acceptance of the city of all dedicated improvements. 
(b)  Street improvements. The following requirements shall apply to all streets within the subdivision. 
(1)  General requirements. 
a.  The location and width of all proposed streets and bridges shall be in conformity with official plans and maps of the city, the comprehensive plan, and this code. 
b.  The proposed street layout of subdivisions with public streets shall be integrated with the street system of the surrounding area. Existing streets shall be extended to provide a connection with adjacent compatible developments where platted rights-of-way or other streets abut the parcel being considered for subdivision approval. Parcels being developed for subdivision approval adjacent to other vacant parcels shall provide street rights-of-way and street improvements to the boundary of the adjacent parcel providing a future connection to the non-platted parcel if the land use and/or zoning of the adjacent parcel is compatible with the proposed plat. Connections shall be provided as required in section 8.6(b)(4)m. Subdivisions constructed with private streets shall be required to provide street connections to adjacent development or stub streets to vacant parcels except that a temporary fence, wall, gate, landscaped barrier, or other acceptable barrier may be permitted between the private street of a subdivision and the public street of subdivision or parcel. Pedestrian ways may be permitted, if desired, to provide a connection between the subdivision. 
c.  Where it is possible to provide for street access to an adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended, by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround shall be required, unless waived by the city due to public safety or for environmental protection. An easement for the turnaround shall be conveyed to the city in form and substance acceptable to the city manager and city attorney. The easement property shall be free of liens or security interests or consented to and joined in by all lienholders. 
d.  There shall be no private streets or tracts platted in any subdivision, except where their control is dedicated or conveyed by warranty deed to the homeowners association with rights of use and right of reversion granted to the city under conditions set forth on the deed and stipulated on the final plat. The property shall be free of liens and security interests or the deed shall be consented to and joined in by all lienholders. The warranty deed shall be in form and substance required by the city manager and city attorney. All private streets shall conform with city standards for design and construction. 
e.  Auxiliary lanes. Auxiliary lanes refer to acceleration, deceleration, and storage lanes. Developments that generate a.m. or p.m. peak hour traffic that exceeds the following thresholds shall provide the following site related acceleration, deceleration, and storage lanes: 
1)  If more than 20 left turning vehicles per hour on a two-lane arterial or collector roadway, then left-turn lanes are warranted. 
2)  If more than 50 right turning vehicles per hour on a two-lane arterial or collector roadway, then right-turn lanes are warranted. 
3)  If more than 80 right turning vehicles per hour on a four-lane arterial or collector roadway, then a right-turn lane is warranted. 
4)  If more than 100 right turning vehicles per hour on a six-lane arterial or collector roadway, then a right-turn lane is warranted. 
5)  If an applicant for a development objects to the requirement for a turn lane, then a traffic analysis shall be submitted per the requirements outlined in the latest edition of the Transportation Technical Manual. 
6)  A left-turn lane is recommended for any intersection that exceeds 30 vehicles per hour on multi-lane roadways. Exclusive left-turn lanes are identified as a required base on Highway Capacity Manual level of service analysis for multi-lane collector roadways. Two-way continuous left-turn lanes shall be designed as per the FDOT guidelines. 
Notwithstanding the above-referenced thresholds, the city engineer will make the final determination whether to require an auxiliary lane in the interest of public safety. Special consideration will be given to urban, downtown areas containing substantial pedestrian traffic, as well as roadways that are maintained by other governmental agencies. 
There may be cases where it will be desirable to provide room for right-turn deceleration, but an entirely separate deceleration lane is either too difficult to install due to design constraints, or is not reasonable. In these cases, a right-turn curb taper shall be provided in accordance with FDOT standards. 
Right-turn acceleration lanes shall not be provided. 
f.  The proposed street layout of subdivisions with residential public streets shall be reviewed for conditions which would promote or result in operating speeds greater than the posted speed or unreasonably attract traffic volumes beyond the immediate street or area streets within or in close proximity to the subdivision. The traffic engineer may require the redesign of the road pattern to address traffic safety issues including the construction of traffic calming measures. 
(2)  Street names. Proposed streets that are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, and the fact that the name is sought to be distinguished only by employing a different designation of the type of public way, such as street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court and the like, shall not suffice. Street names shall require the approval of the city engineer and the county 911 emergency system. Street name and other regulatory signs including pavement markings and signal systems shall be provided within the subdivision by the subdivider. All traffic control devices shall be in accordance with the most recent edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). 
(3)  Grading. All streets should be graded to their full right-of-way width. All areas required for roadways, drainage, or utilities shall be cleared. The applicant shall attempt to save trees by creating landscape tracts or realigning the roadway where possible. Finished grade, cross section, and profile shall be approved by the city engineer consistent with this code.

2.  Widths. Blocks shall have sufficient width to allow two tiers of lots of at least minimum depth as required by the zoning ordinance for the particular district classification. Blocks may consist of single tier lots where such are required to separate residential development from through vehicular traffic, nonresidential uses, the outer edge of the subdivision, or when abutting wetlands, tracts, or other non-platted parcels. 
3.  Nonresidential blocks. Such blocks shall require a length sufficient to serve the intended use without adversely affecting traffic circulation of existing or proposed surrounding streets. The width shall be sufficient to provide adequate service areas and parking without requiring excessive points of ingress and egress on abutting streets, and without requiring vehicular maneuvering on public right-of-way. Lots within such blocks shall require a common vehicular access easement dedicated to the use, maintenance and benefit of all lots within the block, or a marginal access street shall be provided, to prevent points of ingress and egress from each lot to the abutting street. 
n.  Traffic calming measures required. When in the opinion of the traffic engineer the design of the street system within a subdivision could likely create the potential for excessive speeds or excessive traffic volumes due to restrictive or hindered design options available to develop a subdivision, the traffic engineer is authorized to require the construction of traffic calming measures within the street system of the subdivision as a condition of preliminary plat review and approval and subdivision construction plan review and approval. 
(5)  Bridges. Bridges shall be designed by a registered professional engineer and constructed only at locations in accordance with the official plans of the city. When bridges are required, they shall be provided by the subdivider across all canals and waterways within the subdivision to provide adequate ingress and egress to all areas. The design of such bridges shall be subject to approval by the city engineer and where applicable to U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. 
(6)  Right-of-way landscaping. All unpaved areas, and above ground utility facility locations within street rights-of-way shall be properly treated with top soil, sprigged, landscaped and maintained until growth is relatively permanent. The plan for such landscaping shall be in conformance with currently approved standards of the city and the design for landscaping at intersections adopted by FDOT, Roadway and Traffic Design Standards, Index No. 546. Landscaped islands or medians may be permitted within the right-of-way of all subdivisions including entrances. These islands shall be designated on the plat and in the subdivision covenants, conditions, and restrictions or stormwater maintenance agreement, as separate tracts to be maintained by an incorporated homeowners' or property owners' association having an enforceable right of assessment for maintenance purposes. The tracts shall at the time of recordation of the final plat in the public records be conveyed by warranty deed to the homeowners' or property owners' association. The islands shall meet the landscaping requirements of appendix D, chapter 9, article XV, City Code. Subdivision identification signs may be constructed consistent with the requirements of appendix D, chapter 11, and appendix D, chapter 9, article XV, section 9.273(d)(4), City Code.

Such structures shall be provided and constructed in platted tracts. 
(7)  Sidewalks. As a condition of the issuance of a building permit for any construction project, the city shall require the developer to construct a sidewalk along the developer's street frontage at the time of development, unless the developer is eligible to make a cash payment to the city in lieu of constructing the sidewalk along the street frontage pursuant to appendix D, chapter 9, article VII. 
a.  All development, including subdivisions, shall provide sidewalks adjacent to the roadway on which the subdivision or development fronts. Sidewalks shall also be provided on both sides of all arterials, collectors, local streets, and marginal access streets located within a subdivision, or on streets abutting the subdivision, unless otherwise provided in this code or in the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan. 
b.  All sidewalks shall be placed within a right-of-way. Whenever this is not possible, sidewalks shall be provided through the creation of access easements. 
c.  Location and width. All sidewalks shall be placed as far from the roadway as practical and shall be free of all obstructions. The location criteria established in the "FDOT Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction and Maintenance for Streets and Highways" should be followed. If a sidewalk must be placed immediately adjacent to the curb, a wider sidewalk shall be required. 
Sidewalks along arterial and collector streets shall be a minimum of five feet in width. Sidewalks no less than four feet in width shall be required along both sides of local residential streets. 
d.  The owner/subdivider shall be responsible for constructing sidewalks in common areas, including tracts, and such sidewalks shall be installed prior to the final inspection of the subdivision improvements for the issuance of a certificate of completion. Each sidewalk shall extend to a curb cut at all street intersections which provides access connections to the sidewalk from the street. All access connections shall provide ADA handicapped accessible ramps consistent with requirements to implement the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 USC 12101 et seq.

Sec. 9.22. - Standards for solid waste disposal receptacles and solid waste recycling receptacles. 
(a)  The receptacles may not be located in a front yard or along a public or private street or thoroughfare. Receptacles may be located in a side or rear yard provided it is not closer than 10 feet to the property line. 
(b)  Receptacles may not encroach upon any parking area and must be clearly accessible to sanitation vehicles. Curbing in front of an access area is not permitted. 
(c)  Residential receptacles will be located no closer than 20 feet and no further than 250 feet away from any residential building within the project. All receptacles shall be located a minimum of 20 feet from any abutting residential property line, or adjacent residential zoning district. Receptacles shall be designed for frontal pickup only with maneuverability considerations for 41.5-foot long sanitation vehicles. 
(d)  Every receptacle pad shall be provided with a ten foot wide by 25 foot long clear zone measured from the rear of the receptacle pad extending away from the receptacle pad. The clear zone shall also extend to a height of 21 feet. Within this area there shall be no obstructions that would prohibit or hinder collection vehicles from having access to disposal or recycling receptacles. 
(e)  All commercial receptacles shall be placed on a 12 foot long by ten foot wide by six inch thick reinforced concrete pad. If more than one receptacle is required, pads may be joined together. All receptacles for multiple-family sites shall be on a 12 foot wide by 18 foot long by six inch thick reinforced concrete pad. The additional area shall include four, 96 gallon toters to be used for recycling materials. 
(f)  All receptacle sites shall be effectively screened to a minimum height of six feet or at least one foot above the height of the enclosed receptacle, whichever is greater. The screen shall be placed on both sides and to the rear of the receptacle, and include a gate. The gate to the enclosure should not block access to any parking space when open. If receptacle sites are joined together no screen will be required between the disposal receptacles. The screen shall abut the receptacle pad. There are no restrictions on the type of material employed in the construction of the container site screening with the following exceptions: 
(1)  Chain link fences with slats shall be prohibited. 
(2)  Bermed areas shall be at a slope no steeper than three feet vertical to one foot horizontal and shall provide drainage inlets to catch stormwater runoff from sloped sides. 
(3)  If open areas are proposed for the bottom of the screen, they shall be no greater than eight inches high. If no open areas are provided in the bottom of the screen, drainage holes shall be provided to allow the pad to be washed and water to drain from the pad. Screens must provide inside clearance of ten feet wide by nine feet deep to allow for receptacle slippage during loading and unloading operations. 
(g)  In addition to the screening requirements, receptacle pads must be effectively buffered along the perimeter of the screen by planting a continuous hedge. The continuous hedge shall immediately abut the exterior of the screen required above, be located along the rear and both sides, and shall meet the landscaping requirements of chapter 9 of this land development code. This shall not be required for those receptacles located at the rear of a property where other buffering blocks the screened pad from view from public rights-of-way and/or adjoining properties. 
(h)  Disposal receptacles equipped with side loading doors must be provided with outward opening doors that provide user access to the side doors. 
(i)  A barrier must be constructed at the rear of the pad to allow for receptacle pickup without damaging the screen. The barrier must, at a minimum, including two concrete filled pipes per receptacle, eight feet in length, buried four feet deep and four feet high. The barrier pipes shall be at least six (6) inches in diameter spaced 48 inches apart and parallel to one another. Galvanized steel pipe is required and should be placed a minimum of one foot from the rear edge of the pad.

Sec. 9.25. - Variances. 
    Variances to the standards of this article, excepting sections 9.22(g) and 9.24, may be granted by the public works and utilities director, upon application by the owner. The public works and utilities director may grant a variance upon finding that: 
(1)  Visibility of the disposal receptacle shall be minimal from roads, thoroughfares, and existing or future adjacent development projects; 
(2)  The site layout creates a practical difficulty necessitating placement of the disposal receptacle adjacent to a road thoroughfare or in the manner proposed; 
(3)  The safety of disposal receptacle pickup vehicles will not be significantly compromised; 
(4)  Disposal receptacle pickup vehicles will be able to easily pick up and return the disposal receptacle; 
(5)  The construction of the disposal receptacle pad, barrier at the rear of the pad, or alternative construction allowing drainage is equal to or better than the quality, strength, and rigidity of construction required by this article; 
(6)  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the development, land, structure, buildings, or amount of solid waste generated or to be generated by the proposed development, justifying the variance; and 
(7)  Denial of the variance would impose a practical difficulty on the owner/developer of the property. 
Within 30 days of the rendition of a determination by the public works and utilities director with regard to a variance provision under this subsection, an aggrieved party may appeal a determination to the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment may affirm, reverse, or modify the public works and utilities director's determination. The board of adjustment shall consider whether the public works and utilities director has accurately considered the requirements of this code and whether there is substantial competent evidence to support the decision of the public works and utilities director.

Sec. 9.73. - Procedure for calculating the required number of spaces. 
(a)  Methodology. This section provides the methodology for calculating parking spaces. This section shall be used in conjunction with section 9.72. 
(1)  Any fractional portion shall be counted as one additional required space. The fractional proportion shall be based on increments of square footage, based on the number of whole increments of 1,000 square feet of gross floor area, except where provided below, a pro-rated amount for the fractional portion of any square foot increment. 
(2)  When subtracting out storage area, the maximum allowable area shall be limited to ten percent. 
(3)  If a parking lot serves two or more uses where the operating hours of the uses do not overlap, the total required number of parking spaces may be reduced. In no case, however, shall the number of spaces required be less than the sum of the largest number of spaces required plus one-half of the required spaces for each additional use. (Reference off-site, off-street parking for standards regarding off-site parking). The community development director shall determine the conditions of overlapping requirements and the amount of reduction in the required number of spaces permitted in accordance with this subsection. Appeals shall be made in writing to the board of adjustment. 
(4)  Parking spaces that are covered or are located within parking structures, garages, or shelters shall be considered as regular parking spaces for purposes of determining the total number of parking spaces. If ten-foot spaces are provided for employees or assigned to residents, support columns for the garage structure may not encroach into the ten-foot parking space. Support columns may encroach into eleven-foot spaces by a maximum of six inches along no more than three feet of the length of the parking space. 
(5)  The sum of parking provided for each individual use listed in section 9.72(a) shall be the total amount of parking required except as provided for as listed above. 
(b)  Parking uses not listed. The following standard shall apply when no specific parking space standards or similar requirements pertaining to parking is available concerning the use of property/building: 
(1)  Where a specific use is not listed, the parking requirements of a similar use shall apply. The city engineer shall determine the required parking upon submittal of a development plan indicating the proposed use(s). Appeals shall be made in writing to the board of adjustment who shall make the final determination. 
(2)  Where there is no use of a similar nature as determined by the community development director, the city engineer shall determine the required parking necessary, after considering all the parking generating factors involved. Appeals shall be made in writing to the board of adjustment who shall make the final determination. 
(c)  Appeals. Appeals to the board of adjustment shall be filed within 30 days of the date of rendition of the decision by the city engineer. Appeals shall state the grounds for appeal. Appeals shall be filed with both the city engineer and the secretary to the board of adjustment. 
(Ord. No. 95-51, § 6, 11-29-1995; Ord. No. 2005-81, § 2, 9-13-2005) 
Sec. 9.74. - Minimum standards for the design of off-street parking areas. 
    This section provides minimum standards for the required design of certain accessory areas including parking lots, drive aisles, setbacks, and yard areas and other off-street and vehicular use areas. Parking or additional parking required as a result of new construction, a change in use of an existing structure, or modification of a non-conforming site requires that code complying landscaping improvements be shown on site plans for all uses at both the time of the site plan approval as well as the time of the building permit issuance in accordance with the Preservation and Landscape Design Code (appendix D, article XV). See section 9.72(a)(57) for parking requirements and design standards specific to the CB-OZ, which is comprised of the Melbourne Downtown Redevelopment Area and the Olde Eau Gallie Riverfront Community Redevelopment Area. 
(a)  Intent. The intent and purpose of this section is: 
(1)  To improve the appearance of required setbacks and yard areas as well as parking lots and other vehicular use areas which will help to protect and preserve the appearance, character and value of the surrounding area and thereby promote the general welfare and aesthetic qualities of the city; 
(2)  To create buffer areas between properties of different zoning classifications and to reduce nuisances of incompatibilities between abutting land uses; and 
(3)  To establish minimum criteria for off-street parking areas by providing for the safety and general welfare. 
(b)  Enforcement. Parking standards on and off-street shall be enforced as provided for in chapter 56, City Code. This section provides minimum standards. More stringent conditions already contained in the Code of Ordinances or hereafter adopted by the city council shall take precedence over the provisions of this chapter and be controlling. 
(c)  Required parking outside CB-OZ. Parking spaces for all dwellings located outside the CB-OZ shall be constructed on the same property with the main building to be served where feasible, unless otherwise permitted in this section, except that one-half the total number of required spaces for multiple-family dwellings, townhouses, and mobile homes may be located in a common parking facility not more than 200 feet distant from the nearest boundary of the site. The owners of off-site parking area property and the property to be served by said off-site parking area shall file with the city a binding lot agreement as required in section 9.75(c). Required parking for residential development projects in the CB-OZ may be entirely located off-site. 
(d)  Minimum spaces required and use areas. Except as provided in section 9.74(r), required off-street parking areas for three or more vehicles serving non-single-family or two-family uses shall have individual spaces marked, and shall be so designed, maintained, and regulated in such a manner that no parking or maneuvering incidental to parking shall be on any area, public street, sidewalk, or alley, and so that any vehicle may be parked and unparked without moving another. 
(e)  Plan required. A plan showing off-street parking, to be developed with or without building improvements, shall be submitted and approved by the engineering division and community development department of the City of Melbourne before a permit is issued for the construction of, or use of the building, structure or accessory, or separate parking facility being considered. This plan shall show the location, and accurately designate the number of required spaces, their size, access aisles, driveways, and their relation to the plan and required landscaping. 
(f)  Access and accessibility. Except as provided in section 9.74(r), each parking space shall be directly accessible from an aisle or driveway leading to a street or alley. Access aisles and/or driveways shall be of sufficient size to permit convenient ingress and egress. Each parking space, with the exception of parking spaces for one- and two-family units, shall be accessible without driving over or through any other parking space. No parking space or loading space shall be located in such manner as to block entry or exit to a building, or ramped curb for handicapped access, and in this respect a clearance shall be provided adjacent to an entrance or exit door equal to the width of the door or three feet, whichever is the greater. No parking space shall be permitted which would require backing into the right-of-way except from single-family and two-family driveways. 
(g)  Paved parking required. All parking areas and vehicular access to parking areas shall be paved with an asphalt, concrete or other surfacing approved by the city engineer, afford adequate drainage, and meet engineering specifications (also see section 9.74(q)). Based on length of driveway and acreage of the affected parcel of land, exceptions can be made in AEU and REU by the city engineer. 
(h)  Parking prohibitions. Required parking areas shall be used for motor vehicle parking only, with no sales display, dead storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing of any kind. 
(i)  Landscaping provisions. All parking areas shall be provided with landscaped areas at the end of each row and meet the landscape requirements specified in City Code, appendix D, chapter 9, article XV. 
(j)  Parking lot lighting. If lighting is provided, it shall be positioned to reflect away from residential areas and from any public street or highway and meet the standards of chapter 26, article III, City Code. 
(k)  Code compliance. All off-street parking spaces shall comply with the off-street parking standards as set forth in this article. 
(l)  Parking space size. 
(1)  Applicability. For the purpose of this article, the term "off-street parking space" shall apply to non-single-family or two-family units. 
(2)  Parking dimensions. 
(a)  Parking shall consist of a minimum rectangular parking area, exclusive of access drives and aisles. 
(b)  Parking dimensions are measured as follows: 
Minimum Width Minimum Length Minimum Length with 2-foot overhang Regular spaces 11 20 18 Parallel spaces 10 25 N/A Non-single family/two family assigned spaces 10 20 18 Employee-assigned spaces, generally 10 20 18 Employee only spaces for the following low turnover uses:       Heavy industrial       Manufacturing       Warehousing       Industrial park       Light industrial 9 20 18       Mini storage       Research and development       Single tenant office building, = 30,000 gsf       Hospital       Nursing home Motorcycle spaces 5 20 N/A  
(c)  Multi-family assigned parking limitations. Any assigned multi-family residential space shall be provided either in an enclosed garage, a gated parking lot or an approved parking lot or with signage on each parking space, or group of spaces, designating that the space is for assigned residential parking only. Minimum width does not apply to a one- or two-car garage. 
(d)  Employee assigned parking limitations. Employee spaces shall be provided for use solely by employees either with an employee only gated area that is designated as "employee only," or in a separate, approved parking lot with signage on each parking space, or group of spaces, designating that the space is for employee parking only. The number of employee parking spaces must be reasonably based on the business proposed in the development and cannot exceed the number of employees on the largest working shift. 
Low-turnover businesses that propose to reduce or eliminate the number of required regular-sized spaces (as set forth in section 9.72) shall submit such request in writing to the community development director and the city engineer. 
(e)  Landscaping bonus for nine-foot-wide spaces. Also, for each nine-foot space provided, an additional 20 square feet of landscaped area must be provided within the parking area. 
(f)  Retrofitting parking spaces. In all cases, a permit to retrofit shall be submitted to code compliance, along with a striping plan and a landscaping plan, to scale, identifying the existing and proposed parking layout. Consideration of Americans with Disabilities Act requirements shall be made and the installation and maintenance of the minimum required landscaping that was approved at the original time of development shall be reviewed. 
(g)  Motorcycle parking spaces. Motorcycle parking spaces may be provided; however, motorcycle parking may not be calculated as required parking spaces. 
(3)  Bicycle parking spaces. Bicycle parking spaces shall consist of a minimum rectangular parking area measuring two feet wide by seven feet in length and with a rack for securing each bicycle. Bicycle lockers may substitute for the rack and space requirement. All bicycle parking areas shall be located in a well-lighted area in close proximity to the building away from the general motor vehicular parking area in order to discourage theft and possible damage. 
(m)  Curbing requirements. Perimeter and interior landscaped areas and sidewalks shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by the use of curbing. When curbing is used as a wheel stop for head-in parking, the 20 foot dimension of the parking space requirement (11 feet by 20 feet) may be reduced to 18 feet. Curbing dimensions for the landscaped area shall conform to the standard (not the Miami-type curb) curb specifications established by the city. Because of safety reasons, individual wheel stops protruding from the pavement are prohibited. Where curb parking abuts a sidewalk the sidewalk width shall be increased by two feet. 
(n)  Aisle widths. Off-street parking areas shall be designed so that there is an unrestricted flow and circulation of traffic within the parking lot as well as at the site ingress/egress points. One-way traffic lanes shall be clearly marked on the paved surface to show the flow of traffic. All areas shall be designed for "head-in" parking only. "Pull through" parking design shall be permitted when necessary to serve special type vehicles such as truck trailers, boat trailers and similar vehicles. The following table shall govern the minimum width of traffic lanes within the parking area: 
Minimum Width 
of Lane(s) Angle of Parking One-way 
(feet) Two-way 
(feet) 0° (parallel to curb) 16 24 45° 16 Not permitted 60° 16 Not permitted 90° (perpendicular to curb) 24 24 No parking allowed 16 24  
(o)  Special parking lot design considerations and restrictions. 
(1)  Whenever an off-street parking area is designed to provide parking of vehicles in six rows or more, interior landscaped curbed areas shall be provided the length of the parking rows to prevent cross traffic flow and traffic hazards. Such planted landscaping between rows shall be not less than eight feet in width measured back of curb to back of curb. Parking rows shall be limited to 300 feet in length. (Also see appendix D, chapter 9, article XV, section 9.273(b)(1)c.5.) 
(2)  Parking may be located in a required front, rear or side yard for single-family and two-family dwellings but may not cover more than 20 percent of the lot or parcel. 
(3)  In the C-P zoning district, required off-street parking spaces may be located in the front yard in accordance with the requirements of appendix D, chapter 9, article XV, section 9.273b.1. In the C-P zoning district, required off-street parking spaces may be located in the side yard, except that no parking space shall be permitted within 15 feet of the side lot line. 
(4)  In the C-1, C-1A, C-2, C-3, M-1, M-2, R-2, R-3 and R-P zoning districts, required off-street parking spaces may be located in the front yard in accordance with the requirements of appendix D, chapter 9, article XV, section 9.273b.1. 
(5)  In all districts requiring rear yard setbacks, required off-street parking spaces may be located in the rear yard, except that no parking space shall be permitted within ten feet of the rear lot line. 
(6)  Other than as listed above in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), no required yard shall be used for any parking space, drive or back-out area, except that access drives may cross the required yard. 
(7)  When parking structures/parking garages are built in any district, whether as an accessory structure or a part of the principal structure, the garage building setback shall comply with the setback requirements of the applicable zoning district, except when abutting a zoning district with a more restrictive setback. In such cases the more restrictive setback of the adjacent zoning district shall apply. In the C-3 zoning district, the parking garage setback shall be no less than five feet. 
(8)  When an area is posted with a sign stating that nonresidential parking is prohibited, only vehicles which are in the area due to an association with a residence may park on either the paved or the unpaved public right-of-way. This shall include the family and guests at a residence, and delivery, service or utility vehicles which are providing materials or services to the residence or to the residential neighborhood. All vehicles shall park in conformance with all other applicable laws and ordinances. 
(9)  Parking lot setbacks are determined by the landscaping regulations outlined in appendix D, chapter 9, article XV, section 9.73. 
(p)  Parking, storage, or use of recreational equipment and recreational vehicles. No recreational equipment or recreational vehicles shall be parked or stored on any lot in a residential district except in a carport, enclosed building, or to the rear of the front building line. 
1.  As it relates to this paragraph, the "front building line" shall be construed as the contour of the building located adjacent to the front yard right-of-way and shall extend parallel to the rights-of-way to the side property lines that intersect the right-of-way. 
2.  All recreational equipment and recreational vehicles may be parked in a side corner yard if located behind a six-foot opaque fence, or parked behind the required side corner setback. 
3.  Recreational equipment and recreational vehicles may be parked anywhere on residential premises during loading/unloading or maintenance for a period not to exceed 48 consecutive hours within a seven-day period. 
4.  Guests with recreational vehicles visiting the residence are allowed to park a recreational vehicle on a designated driveway for up to two weeks per calendar year. No portion of the recreational equipment or recreational vehicles shall extend over any portion of the sidewalk. 
5.  Recreational equipment and recreational vehicles shall not be parked in any right-of-way. 
6.  All recreational equipment and recreational vehicles shall be properly tagged (if applicable) and in operable condition. 
7.  No such recreational equipment or recreational vehicles shall be used for living, sleeping, or housekeeping purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot, or in any location, except as permitted above. No trailer shall be parked on any lot for living purposes other than in established trailer parks. 
For Agriculture Estate Use (AEU) zoning districts, refer to appendix B, article V, section 2(E)(2)(f). 
For Rural Estate Use (REU) zoning districts, refer to appendix B, article V, section 2(F)(2)(e). 
(q)  Vehicular use areas. All areas within commercial, and industrial districts and for residential developments of four or more attached units used for the display or parking of any and all types of motor vehicles, boats, or heavy construction equipment, and all land upon which vehicles traverse the property as a function of the primary use, including but not limited to drives, parking, service and display areas, shall be paved according to the city's engineering specifications. 
(r)  Vehicular use areas for residential developments. 
(1)  Vehicular use areas for single-family, two- and three-family dwellings. All one-, two- and three-family units shall provide a paved drive a minimum of ten feet wide to an enclosed garage. The garage floor shall be made of cement or any material approved by the building official. This requirement shall be applicable to single-, two- or three-family dwellings in any district where such uses are permitted. 
(2)  Vehicular use areas for multiple-family developments utilizing attached one-car garages. Projects where individual units have an attached one-car garage may utilize a paved drive measuring a minimum of ten feet wide by 20 feet long to an enclosed single car garage as a required parking space if noted on the site plan that such a space is assigned to that unit. The garage floor shall be made of cement or any material approved by the building official. 
(s)  Parking for disabled persons. 
(1)  Location: Accessible parking spaces for the physically disabled shall be located on the shortest possible accessible route of travel from adjacent parking to an accessible entrance of a building. In buildings with multiple accessible entrances with adjacent parking, accessible parking spaces for the physically disabled shall be dispersed and located closest to the accessible entrances. Parking spaces shall not be located as to require the disabled person to wheel behind parked vehicles. Parallel parking spaces for the physically disabled shall be located either at the beginning or end of a block or adjacent to alley entrances. Curbs adjacent to such spaces shall be of a height which will not interfere with the opening and closing of motor vehicle doors. 
(2)  Design: Diagonal and perpendicular accessible parking spaces for the physically disabled shall be 12 feet wide, shall have an adjacent five-foot wide access aisle and shall not be located so as to require the handicapped to cross behind another parking space, drive aisle, or other unsafe act in order to obtain access to a building.

1.  Height of the proposed communication tower. 
2.  Proximity of the communication tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries. 
3.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties. 
4.  Surrounding topography. 
5.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage. 
6.  Design of the communication tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness. 
7.  Proposed ingress and egress. 
8.  Availability of suitable existing communication towers and other structures. No new communication tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the City of Melbourne that no existing communication tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing communication tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
a)  No existing communication towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
b)  Existing communication towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
c)  Existing communication towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
d)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing communication towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing communication towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
e)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing communication tower or structure or to adapt an existing communication tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new communication tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
f)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing communication towers and structures unsuitable.

(2)  The site plan development modification will not create any threat to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(b)  In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (a) of this section, in the following cases the applicant must also demonstrate with written evidence the following: 
(1)  In the case of a requested modification to the setback requirement, that the size of plot upon which the tower is proposed to be located makes compliance impossible, and the only alternative for the person is to locate the tower at another site which poses a greater threat to the public health, safety or welfare or is closer in proximity to residentially zoned land. 
(2)  In the case of a request for modification to the separation requirements of section 9.89 that the proposed site is zoned "M-1" or "M-2" and the proposed site is at least double the minimum standard for separation from residentially zoned lands. 
(3)  In the case of a request for modification of the separation requirements of section 9.89, if the person provides written technical evidence from an engineer(s) that the proposed tower and telecommunications facilities must be located at the proposed site in order to meet the coverage needs of the applicant's wireless communications system and if the person is willing to create approved landscaping and other buffers to minimize the visibility to the residential area. 
(4)  In the case of a request for modification of the maximum height limit for towers and telecommunications facilities, that the modification is necessary to (i) facilitate collocation of telecommunications facilities in order to avoid construction of a new tower; or (ii) to meet the coverage requirements of the applicant's wireless communications system, which requirements must be documented with written, technical evidence from an engineer(s) that demonstrates that the height of the proposed tower is the minimum height required to function satisfactorily.

Sec. 9.120. - Repair or replacement of defective sidewalks. 
(a)  Defective sidewalks declared nuisance. It is hereby declared that sidewalks that are broken, cracked, or otherwise in such condition as not to present a smooth, continuous surface are a nuisance; it is further declared to be the duty of the owner or owners of property upon which the sidewalks are located or abutting upon defective sidewalks to remedy such defective condition. All repairs and corrections shall be made in accordance with specifications furnished by the city. 
(b)  Procedure upon failure of owner to repair, generally. Upon the failure of the owner or owners of the premises upon which the sidewalks are located or abutting upon defective sidewalks to remedy the conditions existing in violation of the requirements hereof within 30 days after service of notice so to do as provided herein, then the city manager shall proceed as prescribed below to have such condition remedied and the cost thereof shall be a lien against the abutting property to the same extent and character as are the liens for special assessments or improvements and with the same penalties and with the same rights of collection, foreclosure, sale, and forfeiture as prevail in the case of liens for special improvements as provided for in F.S. ch. 170. 
(c)  Notice of defect. The streets management division shall institute the procedure for the enforcement of the requirements of this division and the removal and correction of conditions in violation of the provisions hereof by making a finding and determining that certain sidewalks are in such condition as to be in violation of this division. The finding may include any number of lots, parcels or tracts of land whose abutting sidewalks are in defective condition. Upon making such a finding, the streets management division shall serve notice upon the owner or owners thereof to comply with the requirements of this division within 30 days after the service of such notice, and for such owner or owners to proceed to have the condition of such sidewalk remedied; and should such condition not be remedied within 30 days, the city manager is authorized to proceed to remedy such condition. The notice shall be given by registered mail addressed to the owner or owners of the property described, as their names and addresses are shown upon the records of the tax assessor of this city and shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. Such notice shall be in substantially the following form: 
Name of owner  _____ Address of owner  _____ (Describe property briefly)  
An inspection of the sidewalk abutting this property discloses, and the City of Melbourne has found and determined, that it is in such condition as to be in violation of appendix D, chapter 9, City Code, because such sidewalk is broken, cracked and otherwise so defective as not to present a smooth, continuous surface and the existence of this condition constitutes a nuisance which must be abated. 
This said code provides that it shall be unlawful for you to permit this condition to continue, and you are hereby notified that unless the condition is remedied in accordance with city specifications so as to bring it into compliance with the code within 30 days from the date of service of this notice, the City of Melbourne will proceed to remedy the defective condition and the cost of such work will be imposed as alien against this property. Our estimate of the probable cost is $_______. 
(d)  City manager authorized to proceed upon failure of owner to correct. Upon the failure of the owner or owners of such lots, parcels or tracts of land to remedy the condition of such sidewalks found to be in violation of this division within such 30 days, then the city manager is hereby authorized to have the condition remedied either by contract or direct labor or by a combination of both; provided, however, that the cost thereof chargeable to the owner does not exceed the amount of the cost estimated for the work in the initial notice. 
(e)  Entry in sidewalk lien book. Upon completion of the required work by the city to repair the sidewalk abutting certain described lots, tracts or parcels of land found to be in such condition as to be in violation of the requirements of this division, the financial services department shall enter into a book, designated as "Sidewalk Lien Book" which shall be kept for that purpose and which shall be kept open for public inspection, the legal description of the lots or parcels of land involved, the name of the owner or owners thereof as shown on the records of the tax assessor of the city, the date of the initial notice and the date repairs were completed, and the actual cost of repairing the sidewalk. 
(f)  Period for petition for correction of defective lien. The cost of repairing the defective sidewalk condition shall be and become a lien against the abutting property to the same extent and character as is the lien for special assessments or special improvements provided in F.S. ch. 170, as of the date of completion of work by the city; provided that any person owning all or any interest in the property shall have the right at any time within 30 days after the completion of the work to present to the city manager a petition setting forth his interest in the property and alleging that in the opinion of the petitioner the cost of the work as entered in the sidewalk lien book exceeds the actual cost thereof or is otherwise erroneous. The city manager shall consider the same, and make due inquiry into the questions involved, and if it shall appear to the satisfaction of the city manager that the cost as entered is erroneous or unfair, then the city manager shall have the entry in the sidewalk lien book corrected, and shall fix and confirm the amount to be charged against such lot, parcel, or tract of land as he shall find just and proper, and the amount so fixed shall stand as the amount of the lien, effective as of the date of completion of the work aforesaid; or the city manager may confirm the lien in the amount as originally entered in the sidewalk lien book. 
(g)  When lien payable; interest rate. The lien for the cost of repairing such sidewalk or sidewalks found to be violative of this division shall become due and payable 30 days after completion of such work, excepting only those cases in which a petition is filed as set forth in the preceding section where, upon consideration thereof, the city council has changed and corrected the amount of the lien as entered in the sidewalk lien book; in such case the lien shall become due and payable after the final action. After the respective dates above-fixed, all unpaid liens shall become delinquent and shall thereafter bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum until paid in full. 
(h)  Installment payment procedure. The lien for the cost of repairing any sidewalks under the provision hereof, if the same is in excess of $25.00, may be paid in two equal installments due, respectively, on the first day of November following the due date prescribed above and on the first day of November of the year following, provided that the owner or owners of the lot, parcel, or tract of land abutting such sidewalk shall file with the financial services department on or before the due date, a written request assenting to the correctness of the lien, and waiving right of contest thereof. Such deferred installments shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum from and after the due date of the lien, but any such lien or installment thereof may be paid at any time when accompanied by the payment of the interest due upon the entire unpaid balance of the lien to date of payment. Failure to pay any such installment when the same shall become due shall, without notice or other proceeding, cause the entire unpaid balance of the lien to become due and payable forthwith. Further, if before the lien is sold at an annual tax sale the amount of such delinquency and all interest upon the entire unpaid balance is paid, then the further installment or installments shall again be due and payable at the time set forth in the written undertaking.

(d)  Criteria for issuance of permits. Tree permits shall be issued in accordance with this section when the code compliance division has been satisfied that the application meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  The subject tree is located within the area where any building, roadway, pavement, retention pond or other improvement is proposed to be constructed, or where a grade change necessary to proposed development of the site will be made which is too severe for the tree to survive, and cannot be reasonably accommodated with tree wells as determined by the code compliance division, and such proposed improvements or grade change cannot be relocated upon the site so as to further maximize the preservation of the existing trees upon the site while not unreasonably restricting the permitted use of the property. 
(2)  It is in the welfare of the general public that the tree be removed for a reason other than set forth above. 
(3)  Appropriate arrangements for disposal of trees, and tree parts have been provided. Commercially viable grade trees shall be salvaged and used for commercial resources including lumber or mulch materials when such vegetation is of sufficient size, of a healthy condition, and economically viable to do so. Canopy trees removed shall be made available for use as commercial wood products. No vegetative debris, including limbs, trunks, roots, leaves, or mulched vegetative materials shall be used for fill material except for landscaped ground cover. 
(e)  Relocation or replacement. 
(1)  As a condition to the granting of a tree removal permit under this section the applicant may be required, where practical, to: 
a.  Relocate those trees which would otherwise be destroyed, to another location upon the site; or 
b.  Replace those trees which will be destroyed with suitable replacement trees elsewhere within the site. Such replacement trees shall be of a variety listed in section 9.273(c)(2)(a), or of any other variety approved by the code compliance division. No less than 80 percent of replacement trees shall be of the species classified as being drought tolerant. 
(2)  In determining the required relocation or replacement of trees, the code compliance division or agency shall consider the needs of the intended use of the property, including all lands dedicated to public use, together with an evaluation of the following: 
a.  Existing tree coverage on the site and in the immediate surrounding area. 
b.  Number of trees to be removed on the entire site. 
c.  The type, size and condition of the trees to be removed. 
d.  The feasibility of relocating the particular trees, including relocating such trees to public lands or rights-of-way. 
e.  Topography and drainage of the site. 
f.  The extent to which the trees contribute to the aesthetic, economic and environmental integrity of the surrounding area. 
(f)  Procedure for permitting tree removal. 
(1)  Upon receipt of a completed application containing all the information as required by this article, the code compliance division shall review said application. The review procedure shall determine the adequacy and accuracy of content and determine whether the application meets the requirements of this section and whether the applicant has taken all necessary and reasonable steps and considered design alternatives to preserve existing trees and to otherwise enhance the aesthetic appearance of the proposed development by the incorporation of existing trees into the design process. 
(2)  Following approval of the application, the code compliance division shall issue the appropriate permits and indicate compliance with the provisions herein. 
(3)  Upon the issuance of a tree removal permit under this section, a copy of said permit shall be prominently displayed on the site prior to the removal, relocation or replacement of any trees. Tree removal permits shall be included with all other permit cards and shall be displayed alongside them on the site. 
(4)  No final certificate of occupancy shall be issued nor electrical power connection authorization given until any relocation or replacement of trees required by the tree removal permit has been completed and final tree inspection approval has been given by the code compliance division. Trees relocated from one portion of the site to another which do not survive transplantation for at least one year shall be replaced by the owner of the site with a suitable replacement tree listed in section 9.273(c)(2)(a). 
(g)  Protection of trees not approved for removal, relocation or destruction. It shall be unlawful for any person to place, or cause to place, materials, machinery or temporary soil deposits within the drip line of any tree protected by this chapter and not permitted for removal or destruction; to fail to erect and maintain barriers until certificate of occupancy, necessary to protect such tree or to attach anything other than protective wires, braces or other similar, non-injurious materials to such tree. Furthermore, no structure or impervious paving shall be located within a five foot radius of the trunk perimeter of any such tree. A tree of 1.5 feet or more in diameter shall require additional space as may be determined by the code compliance division. 
(h)  Penalty for removal or destruction of any tree not approved for removal or relocation. 
(1)  When a tree removal permit is required, any time that a tree is removed without a permit, the building official or code compliance division may cite the owner or developer of the property from which the tree was removed, and the person removing the tree, for a violation of this section 9.272(h)(1), City Code, illegal tree removal. Each day that the property is not in compliance with this code provision shall be deemed to be a separate offense and violation hereof, and destruction of a tree without a required permit shall be considered to be an irreversible and irreparable violation of this code. Alleged violators may be prosecuted before the code enforcement board, or as otherwise provided in this code or by law. 
(2)  Regardless of any action that may be taken by the code enforcement board, the property owner on whose property the tree was removed shall provide replacement trees of the same type and size as the one destroyed. If it is not possible to replace the tree with those of exact size and variety, the following replacement requirements shall apply: 
a.  A canopy tree must be replaced with a canopy tree. 
b.  An accent may be replaced with an accent or a canopy. 
c.  Each illegally removed tree must be replaced with a containerized (not field grown) tree of a cumulative trunk diameter equal to or greater than the sum in inches for each inch of tree removed and no tree may be used as a replacement tree that has less than six inch caliper measured one foot above grade when feasible. 
d.  Replacement trees may be no less than 12 feet high. 
(3)  Until the illegally destroyed or removed trees are replaced on the site, no certificate of occupancy or completion, if applicable, shall be issued by the city. 
(4)  Replacement trees under subsection (h) shall not be counted toward satisfying the minimum landscaping requirements for development.

CHAPTER 10. - IMPACT FEES[12] 
Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
State Law reference- Impact fees, F.S. § 163.31801. 

ARTICLE I. - TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEES 

Sec. 10.01. - Short title and intent. 
(a)  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Transportation Impact Fee Code." 
(b)  The city council has determined and recognized through adoption of the City of Melbourne Comprehensive Plan and the annual Capital Improvement Element updates, as well as the Space Coast Transportation Planning Organization Transportation Improvement Program, that new growth and development which the city will experience will necessitate extensive improvements to the major road network system. In order to finance the necessary new capital improvements, several combined methods of financing shall be employed, one of which will impose a regulatory impact fee on new growth and development which does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated costs of the major road network system expansion and improvements. 
(c)  Implementing a regulatory scheme that requires new development to pay a transportation impact fee that does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new roads and multimodal improvements needed to serve new growth and development is a responsibility of the city in order to carry out the future land use, transportation, and capital improvement elements of the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan, as amended and adopted pursuant to F.S. § 163.3161 et seq., and is in the best interest of the health, safety, economic order, aesthetics, and welfare of the citizens of Melbourne and the region. 
(d)  The purpose of the transportation impact fee code is to enable the city to allow growth and development to proceed in the city in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan, and to regulate growth and development so as to require growth and development to share in the burden of growth by paying its pro rata share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of the major road network system improvements. Additionally, the city through this code seeks to provide on an equitable, fair share basis for new and expanded roadway and transportation systems concurrent with the impacts and need generated by new development. 
(e)  It is not the purpose of this transportation impact fee code to collect fees from growth and development in excess of the cost of the reasonably anticipated improvements to the major road network system needed to serve the new growth and development. The city council hereby finds that this ordinance has approached the problem of determining the road impact fee in a conservative and reasonable manner. By virtue of this transportation impact fee code and other ordinances of the city, existing residents also will pay a fair share of the cost of needed improvements to the major road network system. 
(f)  Within a mobility district, a developer, or property owner, has the option to provide a payment in lieu of providing required mobility improvements. If this option is chosen, 50 percent of the required amount will be deposited into the transportation impact fee trust fund and 50 percent will be deposited into the trust fund for the mobility district in which the development project is located. Within a mobility district, if the developer, or property owner, of a development chooses to provide the mobility improvements required pursuant to section 3.102, appendix D of this code, transportation impact fees will not be collected by the city. 
A developer or property owner has the option to provide a combination of mobility improvements and payment in lieu of construction. This option allows a property owner/developer to construct a specific number of mobility improvements while providing a payment in lieu of construction for the remaining improvements required by section 3.102(c)(1). This option must be approved in advance by the community development director in consultation with the city engineer. 
If a developer chooses to exclusively provide mobility improvements, and the construction value of the provided mobility improvements does not exceed the total amount of impact fees that would be required pursuant to section 10.04, appendix D of this code, the developer or property owner will pay an amount equal to the difference between the total cost of the mobility improvements and the amount of required impact fees. Property owners or developers will not receive a credit if the cost of providing mobility improvements exceeds the total amount of impact fees that would be required pursuant to section 10.04. For nonresidential projects, the difference will be due upon the issuance of a building permit. For residential developments, the payment must be made in conjunction with subdivision infrastructure or upon the issuance of a certificate of completion for the project. 
(g)  All construction costs for mobility improvements must be validated by the engineering department. The developer or property owner must provide notarized affidavits under penalty of perjury regarding the construction costs to the engineering department. 
(h)  Where the required mobility improvements have not been completed prior to the submission of a final plat or by issuance of a certificate of occupancy or completion for the first habitable structure within the development, the approval of the plat or certificate of occupancy will be subject to the developer or property owner, guaranteeing the installation of said mobility improvements by filing a performance and payment bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the state by the Florida Insurance Commissioner; tri-party agreement; or a letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, located and doing business in the state and licensed by the federal government or the State of Florida Comptroller to do business in Florida as a bank or savings and loan association, in the amount of 110 percent of the construction cost, including fill dirt, as determined by the city engineer.

(b)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use for which the building permit is proposed is not within the above categories or fits within a different category from that determined by the building department, the building official shall render a determination as to the appropriate land use designation. 
(c)  In the event that the fee amount is calculated based on a use category that requires assessment of the fee based on increments of square footage, the building official shall calculate the fee based on the number of whole increments of 1,000 square feet of gross floor area plus a pro rated amount for the fractional portion of any square footage increment. For example, t a manufacturing building with 3,100 square feet of gross floor area would be calculated as follows: 
(1)  3,100 (the gross floor area) divided by 1,000 (the unit increment) = 3.1 units. 
(2)  3.1 (total units) x 1,198 (the fee per unit) = $3,713.80. 
(d)  The building official is hereby delegated the authority to compute the impact fee due and payable pursuant to this section 10.04. In computing a fee, the building official shall consider all credit or determinations made by the city engineer. 
(e)  Upon rendition of any determination made pursuant to this section, an appeal may be made to the planning and zoning board pursuant to section 10.10. 
(Ord. No. 95-42, § 1, 9-12-1995; Ord. No. 2005-75, § 2, 6-28-2005; Ord. No. 2006-101, § 3, 10-24-2006; Ord. No. 2012-23, § 1, att., 6-26-2012; Ord. No. 2013-36, § 6(10.04), 5-28-2013; Ord. No. 2015-45, § 12, 9-8-2015) 
Sec. 10.05. - Alternative impact fee calculation authorized. 
(a)  Generally. In the event an applicant believes that the cost of off-site improvements needed to serve said applicant's proposed development is less than the fee established in section 10.04, the applicant may submit an alternative fee calculation to the city engineer pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the city engineer finds that the data, information and assumptions used by the applicant to calculate the alternative impact fee satisfy the requirements of this section, the alternative impact fee shall be deemed the impact fee due and owing for the proposed development. 
(b)  Alternative impact fee calculation. The alternative impact fee shall be calculated by use of the following formula: 
(1)  New travel = Trips per day per unit × trip length × percent new travel. 
(2)  New road capacity = New travel/2/lane capacity. 
(3)  Total cost = New road capacity × cost per lane mile. 
(4)  Credits = (Dollar per gallon × (annual travel) / (miles per gallon)) × present value factor. 
(5)  Net cost = Total cost - credits. 
(6)  Impact fee = Net cost. 
(c)  Data, information and assumption requirements. The alternative impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this article or independent sources, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is an accepted standard source of transportation engineering or planning data or information. 
(2)  The independent source is a local study carried out by a qualified traffic planner or engineer pursuant to an accepted methodology of transportation planning or engineering. The city engineer shall review the qualifications of the traffic planner or engineer to determine whether said individual is a "qualified" traffic planner or engineer. A "qualified" traffic planner or engineer should at a minimum have a demonstrated record of experience and competency in traffic planning or engineering. 
(3)  If a previously approved development submitted, during the approval process, a traffic impact study substantially consistent with the criteria required by this section 10.05, and if that study is determined to still be valid, the traffic impacts of the approved development shall be presumed to be as described in such prior study. In such circumstances, the transportation impact fee payable for such development under this article shall be revised accordingly to reflect the presumed traffic impact of such development. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a traffic impact study conducted more than five years (one year = 365 days) earlier is invalid. 
(d)  Diversion and capture factor. The diversion and capture factor used in the alternative impact fee calculations shall be based on actual surveys conducted in the city. For the purposes of the alternative impact fee calculation, the diversion and capture figure shall be the percentage of average daily trips that a proposed use will generate that constitute new or additional trips added to the city's major road network system. Those trips that do not represent additional trip ends shall not be counted as new or additional trips. 
(e)  Appeals to the planning and zoning board. A determination by the city engineer that the alternative calculation does not satisfy the requirements of this section or otherwise disapproving of the same, may upon rendition be appealed to the planning and zoning board pursuant to section 10.10. 
(Ord. No. 95-42, § 1, 9-12-1995; Ord. No. 2005-75, § 3, 6-28-2005; Ord. No. 2006-101, § 4, 10-24-2006; Ord. No. 2015-45, § 12, 9-8-2015) 
Sec. 10.06. - Credits. 
(a)  An applicant may be entitled to a credit against any transportation impact fee assessed pursuant to this article in an amount equal to the cost of off-site improvements or contributions of land, money or services for off-site improvements contributed or paid for by the applicant as a condition of a city issued development order related to the development project subject to a transportation impact fee. No credit given to the applicant shall exceed the assessed transportation impact fee for the project. Transportation impact fee credits shall be based on the following criteria: 
(1)  The actual cost or estimated cost of improvements based on recent bid sheet information of the city. 
(2)  A pro rata share of the appraised land value of the parent parcel as determined by an appraiser who is a member of the Appraisal Institute (M.A.I.) selected and paid for by the applicant. Any appraisal must be certified to and in favor of the city for reliance purposes. In the event the city engineer disagrees with the appraised value, he may engage another appraiser, and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals. 
(b)  Appeals to the planning and zoning board. The credit determination shall be made by the city engineer. A determination by the city engineer relating to a credit determination pursuant to this section may be appealed to the planning and zoning board upon rendition pursuant to section 10.10. 
(Ord. No. 95-42, § 1, 9-12-1995; Ord. No. 2005-75, § 4, 6-28-2005; Ord. No. 2006-101, § 5, 10-24-2006; Ord. No. 2015-45, § 12, 9-8-2015) 
Sec. 10.07. - Funds collected. 
(a)  Creation of trust funds. 
(1)  The impact fees collected by the city pursuant to this transportation impact fee code will be kept separate from other revenue of the city. There will be one fund established for the three benefit zones. The zones are defined as follows: 
Zone 1: All of the incorporated area, present and by any future annexation, west of the Indian River Lagoon and north of the northern section line of Section 33, Township 27, Range 37 and its east-west extensions. 
Zone 2: All of the incorporated area, present and by any future annexation, west of the Indian River Lagoon and south of the northern section line of Section 33, Township 27, Range 37 and its east-west extensions. 
Zone 3: All of the incorporated area, present and by any future annexations, east of the Indian River Lagoon. 
(2)  Within each zone, impact fees shall be accounted for separately according to eligible use for improvements to city and county or state roads. 50 percent of the funds shall be earmarked for improvements to streets operated and maintained by and under the city's jurisdiction. 50 percent of the funds shall be earmarked for improvements to the roads within the city that are operated and maintained by and under the jurisdiction of Brevard County or the Florida Department of Transportation. 
(b)  Limitation on expenditure of funds collected. No impact fees may be expended on a particular capital improvement pursuant to this transportation impact fee code, unless or until the city council programs and identifies the source of funds for right-of-way acquisition and construction of improvements needed to overcome existing service deficiencies for the same particular capital improvement which deficiency is not attributable to new growth and development. 
(1)  The funds collected by reason of the establishment of the transportation impact fee in accordance with this transportation impact fee code will be used solely for the purpose of acquisition, expansion and development of the roads, streets, highways, bridges, bicycle lanes, transit facilities, and sidewalks determined to be needed to serve new development, including but not limited to: 
(A)  Design and construction plan preparation; 
(B)  Right-of-way acquisition; 
(C)  Construction of new through lanes; 
(D)  Construction of new turn lanes; 
(E)  Construction of new bridges; 
(F)  Construction of new drainage facilities in conjunction with new roadway construction; 
(G)  Purchase and installation of traffic signalization; and 
(H)  Construction of new curbs, medians, shoulders, sidewalks, transit facility improvements and bikeways. 
(2)  All funds shall be used exclusively within the benefit areas from which they were collected and in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in Contractors & Builders Association v. City of Dunedin, 329 So.2d 314 (Fla. 1976); Hollywood, Inc. v. Broward County, 431 So.2d 606 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983), rev. denied, 440 So.2d 352 (Fla. 1983); Home Builders and Contractors Association of Palm Beach County, Inc. v. Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County, 446 So.2d 140 (Fla. 4th DCA 984), rev. denied, 451 So.2d 848 (Fla. 1984); St. Johns County v. N.E. Florida Builders, 583 So.2d 635 (Fla. 1991), and otherwise consistent with all requirements of the Constitution of the United States, the Florida Constitution of 1968, and all applicable laws. Said funds shall not be used to maintain or repair any roads. 
(c)  Disbursal of funds. Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used solely in accordance with the provisions of this section. The disbursal of such funds shall require the approval of the city council. 
(d)  Interest on funds. Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in interest-bearing accounts. All income derived shall be deposited in the applicable trust account. 
(e)  Return of funds. The fees collected pursuant to this transportation impact fee code shall be returned to the then present owner of the development if the fees have not been encumbered or spent by the end of the six-year period from the date the fees were received in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  The then present owner must petition the city manager for the refund within 90 days following the end of the six years from the date on which the fee was received. 
(2)  The petition must be submitted to the city manager and must contain: 
(A)  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the current owner of the property from which the impact fee was assessed; 
(B)  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the fee; 
(C)  A certified copy of the latest recorded deed showing ownership of the property from which the impact fee was assessed; and 
(D)  A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill for the property from which the impact fee was assessed. 
(3)  Within 60 days from the date of receipt of the petition for refund, the city manager shall make a rendition of a determination whether a refund shall be made, advising the petitioner of the determination. For the purposes of determining whether fees have been spent or encumbered, the first money placed in a trust fund account shall be deemed to be the first money taken out of that account when withdrawals have been made in accordance with this subsection. 
(4)  When the money requested is still in the trust fund account and has not been spent or encumbered by the end of the six years from the date the fees were paid, the money shall be returned with interest at the rate of interest earned by the city during the six year period. 
(Ord. No. 95-42, § 1, 9-12-1995; Ord. No. 2005-75, § 5, 6-28-2005; Ord. No. 2006-101, § 6, 10-24-2006; Ord. No. 2012-23, § 2, 6-26-2012; Ord. No. 2013-36, § 6(10.07), 5-28-2013) 
Sec. 10.08. - Exemptions. 
(a)  The following shall be exempted from payment of impact fees pursuant to this Transportation Impact Fee Code: 
(1)  Any building or structure owned by any federal, state, county, or local governmental entity and intended to be utilized for governmental purposes. Governmentally owned property leased for non-governmental purposes shall not be included within this exemption. 
(2)  Alterations of an existing structure with no increase in GFA. 
(3)  The construction of an accessory use or accessory structures. 
(4)  The replacement or enlargement of a building, not to exceed an increase of 50 percent of the GFA of the existing building if it is located in a community redevelopment area, and provided that the land use remains unchanged. If the land use of the replacement or enlargement building is different from the land use of the existing building, then the exemption is equal to an amount calculated by using the impact fee rate in the transportation impact fee schedule set forth in section 10.04 herein for the land use type of the existing building and multiplying it by the number of land use units of not to exceed 150 percent of the land use units in the existing building. The exemption shall be subtracted from the calculation of the impact fee for the replacement or enlargement building based on the impact fee rate for its land use type multiplied by the number of its land use units to determine the net amount of impact fees payable. 
(5)  The replacement of a building, not to exceed the GFA of the existing building if it is not located in a community redevelopment area, and provided that the land use remains unchanged. If the land use type of the replacement building is different from the land use type of the existing building, then the exemption is equal to an amount calculated by using the impact fee rate in the transportation impact fee schedule set forth in section 10.04 herein for the land use type of the existing building and multiplying it by the number of land use units in the existing building. The exemption shall be subtracted from the calculation of the impact fee for the replacement building, which is based on the impact fee rate for its land use type and the number of land use units in the replacement building, to determine the net amount of impact fees payable. 
(b)  The amount of the exemption shall not exceed the impact fee amount applicable to the enlargement or replacement building. The exemption can only be applied to a replacement or enlargement building located on the same lot as the existing building. The exemption shall only be applicable to a replacement building if its building permit is issued within five years of the issuance of the demolition permit for the original building. Exemptions for enlargement of a building pursuant to this subsection shall be limited to buildings which received a certificate of occupancy at least five years prior to expansion and shall not include phased projects; separate principal buildings on the same parcel of land; or additional buildings which were part of a unified site plan. 
(Ord. No. 95-42, § 1, 9-12-1995; Ord. No. 2000-13, § 1, 1-25-2000; Ord. No. 2011-26, § 1, 7-12-2011) 
Sec. 10.09. - Impact fee agreements and security requirements. 
(a)  Impact fee agreement. 
(1)  In lieu of the payment of fees as calculated in section 10.04 or 10.05, any applicant may propose to enter into an impact fee agreement with the city designed to establish just and equitable fees or their equivalent and standards of service needs appropriate to the circumstances of the specific development proposed. Such an agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which permit the construction of specific transportation improvements in lieu of or with a credit against the transportation impact fee assessable and/or pursuant to a payback schedule, allow the developer to recover the actual cost of such improvements in excess of the amount which would have been assessed pursuant to this transportation impact fee code as subsequent users of such off-site improvements obtain building permits and pay impact fees. 
(2)  Any agreement proposed by an applicant pursuant to this subsection shall be presented to and approved by the city council prior to the issuance of a building permit. Any such agreement may provide for execution by mortgagees, lienholders, or contract purchasers in addition to the applicant and landowner, and may permit any party to record said agreement in the public records of Brevard County. The city council shall approve such an agreement only if it finds that the agreement will apportion the burden of expenditure for new facilities in a just and equitable manner, consistent with the principles set forth in the judicial decisions set forth in section 10.07(b)(2). 
(3)  If an application for annexation of property into the city includes a definite plan of development, the city may agree to reduce impact fees to not less than the total impact fee, including water and sewer hook-up or connection fees applicable in the county, that would have been charged if the development had occurred in the unincorporated area. In no case shall the water and/or sewer connection charges be less than the regular charge in the city at the time of development. 
(b)  Deferred contracts. In order to partially or completely mitigate for potentially adverse effects on the production of affordable housing that may be due to the imposition of the transportation impact fee, the city shall, upon approval of an application from any eligible new homebuyer, execute a contract to defer payment of a percentage of the transportation impact fee according to the provisions described herein. 
(1)  Moderate-income. For the purchase of a newly constructed principal residence, the sales price or value of which does not exceed the maximum eligible sales price, the city shall defer payment of 25 percent of the transportation impact fee imposed by this code for any homebuyer that qualifies as a moderate-income person or moderate-income household. The homebuyer shall pay the remaining 75 percent of the transportation facilities impact fee prior to the receipt of a building permit in accordance with the provisions of the contract for deferral and this ordinance. Payment of the deferred portion of the transportation impact fee shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the contract for deferral and paragraph (5) below. 
(2)  Low-income. For the purchase of a newly constructed principal residence, the sales price or value of which does not exceed the maximum eligible sales price, the city shall defer payment of 50 percent of the transportation impact fee imposed by this code for any homebuyer that qualifies as a low-income person or low-income household. The homebuyer shall pay the remaining 50 percent of the transportation facilities impact fee prior to the receipt of a building permit in accordance with the provisions of the contract for deferral and this code. Payment of the deferred portion of the transportation impact fee shall be due in accordance with the provisions of the contract for deferral and paragraph (5) below. 
(3)  Very low-income. For the purchase of a newly constructed principal residence, the sales price or value of which does not exceed the maximum eligible sales price, the city shall defer payment of 100 percent of the transportation impact fee imposed by this code for any homebuyer that qualifies as a very-low-income person or a very-low-income household. Payment of the deferred portion of the transpiration impact fee shall be due in accordance with the provisions of the contract for deferral and paragraph (5) below. 
(4)  A developer of an affordable housing project comprised of rental housing affordable to very-low, low and moderate income persons or households may apply for deferral of transportation impact fees. For every rental unit that is limited to occupancy by a moderate-income person or moderate-income household, the city shall defer 25 percent of the transportation impact fee imposed by this code. For every rental unit that is limited to occupancy by a low-income person or low-income household, the city shall defer 50 percent of the transportation impact fee imposed by this code. For every rental unit that is limited to occupancy by a very low-income person or very low-income household, the city shall defer 100 percent of the transportation impact fee imposed by this code. Payment of the deferred portion of the transportation impact fee shall be due in accordance with the provisions of the contract for deferral and paragraph (5) below. 
(5)  A new moderate-income, low-income, or very low-income homebuyer or a builder/developer of an affordable housing project that wishes to defer payment of a percentage of the transportation impact fees assessed on a residential property shall submit an application together with the necessary supporting documentation to the housing and community development department to initiate an eligibility review. If the housing and community development department determines based on the eligibility review that the application qualifies as an affordable housing project and the city engineer or designee approves the applicant is eligible for deferral of transportation impact fees, the housing and community development department will prepare a contract for deferral. The contract for deferral shall include provisions for the new homebuyer to execute a mortgage or a builder/developer of an affordable housing project to execute a land use and deed restriction affordability agreement (LURA); consistent with the written policies and procedures established by city council. The contract for deferral shall set forth the terms for payment of the balance of the transportation impact fee that remains unpaid and to notify the city of the date of the closing on the eligible property. The mortgage shall also indicate that the unpaid balance is due and payable upon the subsequent sale of the property by the homebuyer. 
    The LURA with the builder/developer of an affordable housing project shall expressly state conditions when the unpaid balance is due. The mortgage or LURA shall be in legal and recordable form acceptable to the city attorney and shall authorize the city to record the mortgage or LURA in the official records of the county. Upon execution, the mortgage shall constitute a lien on the property for the balance of the transportation facilities impact fee that is due under the terms and conditions of this subsection. If a LURA is executed in lieu of a mortgage, then the LURA shall provide for the timetable of the balance due, plus payment of penalties and interest in the event of a breach of the terms of the LURA. 
    The record for monitoring the progress and ultimate compliance with the LURA will be kept by the housing and community development department. The mortgage shall provide a due-on sales clause similar to that found in standard FHA or FNMA form mortgages in use in Brevard County and require payment upon conveyance. The mortgage or LURA shall provide for collection of attorneys' fee in the enforcement of the mortgage or LURA, and require that property insurance be posted with the city designated as "loss payee" in at least the value of the physical improvements to the property.

Sec. 10.10. - Interpretation of transportation impact fee code; appeals to the planning and zoning board. 
(a)  Interpretation of transportation impact fee code. All questions of interpretation of this transportation impact fee code shall be first presented to the city engineer. In interpreting this code, the city engineer shall be first guided by the plain meaning of the words and terms in this code and second by the intent expressed herein. The city engineer shall make interpretations by interpreting the code as a whole and not by taking specific words or clauses in isolation. Any interpretation shall be subject to rendition in a written, dated form. Thereafter, the planning and zoning board shall decide appeals from the city engineer's interpretation where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the city engineer in interpreting this code. 
(b)  Decisions that may be appealed. Appeals to the planning and zoning board may be taken by the city council, the city manager, or any person aggrieved by any decision of the following: 
(1)  Interpretation by the city engineer of the meaning of wording in this transportation impact fee code made pursuant to section 10.10(a); 
(2)  Interpretation by the city engineer of the use classification of a particular development project pursuant to section 10.04;

Footnotes: 
--- (13) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2005-75, § 7, adopted June 28, 2005, amended the title of art. II to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, art. II was entitled, "Recreational Impact Fee for New Development." See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 10.20. - Fee required. 
    The payment of a fee to the city to be used for the acquisition expansion, construction and provision of city recreational facilities shall be required in the following circumstances: 
(1)  As a condition of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any newly constructed single-family home. A new single-family home shall be one which was constructed on a vacant lot or parcel or the reconstruction or renovation of a building that was not previously occupied as a dwelling unit of any kind. 
(2)  As a condition for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for duplex dwelling units, multifamily dwelling units, townhouse development, planned residential development for mobile home parks, or planned unit developments where two or more residential dwelling units are to be constructed on one lot, parcel or tract of property whether under a common ownership or common beneficial interest or whether one building permit or more than one building permit is applied. 
When additional dwelling units are added to a lot, parcel, tract of property, thereby increasing the total number of dwelling units to two or more, the requirements and conditions of this article shall be imposed for all dwelling units. 
(Ord. No. 97-50, § 3, 10-14-1997) 
Sec. 10.21. - Calculation of fees. 
    The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the fee required to be paid. That density shall be determined by multiplying the maximum number of units shown on the proposed plat or site plan times the population per unit. The population per unit shall be determined as follows: 
Type of unit Population per unit Single-family 2.4 Multifamily 2.0  
The fee to be paid shall be calculated by multiplying the sum of $225.00 by the total number of population in the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 97-50, § 3, 10-14-1997; Ord. No. 2005-75, § 8, 6-28-2005) 
Sec. 10.22. - Credit for private recreation areas. 
    When a subdivider or developer provides certain facilities and improvements suitable for active recreation use of the residents of a proposed development, the demand for certain local public recreational facilities is reduced. Where a subdivider or developer provides improvements or facilities as listed in section 10.23, the developer or subdivider shall receive a credit to be applied against the cost of providing that particular facility. However, no credit shall be provided for the athletic center. The credit shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  The subdivider or developer shall provide the parks and recreation director with detailed plans and specifications of the improvements and facilities to be constructed, whereupon, the parks and recreation director shall determine whether the proposed facilities will reduce the need for additional public recreation facilities. 
(2)  The amount of credit per facility shall be calculated by use of the following formula: 
Cost of facility per person (listed in section 10.23) × persons per unit × number of units = amount of dollars credited against impact fee. 
(3)  The credit provided for herein shall only be given if the subdivider or developer guarantees that: 
a.  The improvements or facilities to be provided are listed in the chart below and are suitable for the active recreational use of the residents of the proposed development. 
b.  By written agreement, recorded covenant or restriction, the continued recreational use of the improvements or facilities is guaranteed. 
(4)  Recreation impact fees credited to a developer, for improvements eligible for impact fee credits, shall be provided on a lot-by-lot basis. The impact fee amount shall be reduced equally for each lot or in the case of multifamily residential projects each dwelling unit, within the development by assessing the total impact fee per lot or unit minus the proportionate share of the credit applied to each lot. Should a subdivider or developer desire, a recreation impact fee payment agreement may be provided to ensure payment of fees. Such agreement shall be acceptable to the city attorney and city manager and shall be recorded with the final plat or prior to a certificate of occupancy for multifamily developments.

credit Tennis court 3.50 Baseball/softball fields 3.33 Basketball courts 2.60 Multi-purpose/soccer fields 4.00 Swimming pools 26.00 Playgrounds 2.50 Shuffleboard courts 1.39 Handball/racquetball 1.65 Volleyball 0.50 Physical exercise (trail) 0.67 Multi-use court 4.29  
(2)  Calculation of a credit toward the payment of the recreation impact fee shall be the amount of credit per person times the persons per unit as described in section 10.21 times the number of dwelling units. This amount may be subtracted from the required fee if, in the opinion of the parks and recreation director, the proposed facilities reduce the need for public facilities. 
(Ord. No. 97-50, § 3, 10-14-1997; Ord. No. 2005-75, § 9, 6-28-2005; Ord. No. 2014-69, 11-25-2014) 
Sec. 10.24. - Credit for the dedication of land for active recreation uses. 
    Upon the dedication of two or more acres of land to the city as hereinafter set forth, a subdivider or developer shall receive a credit against the fee otherwise required to be paid pursuant to this article. The credit shall be applied as follows: 
(1)  The credit shall be calculated by the following formula: 
Fair market value of land dedicated/Fee required to be paid = % of credit 
The fee required to be paid pursuant to this article shall be reduced by the percentage of credit determined by the above formula. If the percentage of credit is 100 percent or more, no fee shall be required to be paid. 
(2)  The credit shall become effective upon city council acceptance of the dedication of the land. Said land shall not be accepted by the city council unless it finds the land to be suitable for active recreation purposes. In determining the suitability of the land for active recreation purposes, the city council may consider all factors and variables affecting such suitability, including, but not limited to:

b.  Size. 
c.  Fair market value. 
d.  Physical characteristics and qualities. 
e.  Proximity of the land to other recreation facilities.

The city shall maintain records of monies collected adequate to determine the amount contributed to the fund from each particular development. The funds collected from any development shall be used only to acquire, construct or provide recreational improvements or facilities needed or anticipated to be needed by the residents of the particular development. The city shall maintain records of all funds expended and the purposes for which they were expended.

ARTICLE III. - PUBLIC FACILITIES IMPACT FEES 

Sec. 10.41. - Short title and intent. 
(a)  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "public facilities impact fee code." 
(b)  Implementing a regulatory plan that requires new development to pay a "public facilities impact fee" that does not exceed a pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new major police, fire, and general administrative facilities (the "public facilities") needed to serve new growth and development is a responsibility of the city in order to carry out the future land use and capital improvement elements of the Melbourne Comprehensive Plan, as amended and adopted pursuant to F.S. § 163.3161 et seq., and is in the best interest of the health, safety, economic order, aesthetics, and welfare of the citizens of Melbourne and the region. 
(c)  The purpose of the public facilities impact fee code is to enable the city to allow growth and development to proceed in the city in compliance with the comprehensive plan, and to regulate growth and development so as to require growth and development to share in the burden of growth by paying its pro rata share for the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of the major police, fire, and general administrative facilities. The city through this code seeks to provide an equitable, fair share basis for new and expanded public facilities commensurate with the impacts and need generated by new development. 
(d)  It is not the purpose of this public facilities impact fee code to collect fees from growth and development in excess of the cost of the reasonably anticipated improvements to the public facilities needed to serve the new growth and development. Existing residents shall also pay a fair share of the cost of needed public facilities improvements. The city council hereby finds that the public facilities impact fee has been determined in a conservative and reasonable manner. 
(Ord. No. 2005-75, § 13, 6-28-2005) 
Sec. 10.42. - Fee required. 
(a)  All new development or an expansion or enlargement of existing development shall pay a public facilities impact fee to the city to be used to provide additional capacity improvements needed to police, fire, and general administrative facilities based on increased demand for services due to growth. Such impact fee shall be paid at the rate set forth below. 
Land 
Use 
Category Unit of 
Measure Impact Fee 
Per Unit Residential Single-family Dwelling unit $250.00 Multifamily Dwelling unit $223.00 Nonresidential General Retail 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $668.00 Service Stations 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $292.00 Eating and drinking 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $1,593.00 Office 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $187.00 Financial/Insurance 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $248.00 Hotel/Motel 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $687.00 Motor vehicle sales 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $206.00 Industrial 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $76.00 Warehousing 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $37.00 Institutional 1,000 s.f. (GFA) $531.00  
(b)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use for which the building permit is proposed is not within the above categories or fits within a different category from that determined by the building department, the building official shall render a determination as to the appropriate land use designation. 
(c)  In the event that the fee amount is calculated based on a use category that requires assessment of the fee based on increments of square footage, the building official shall calculate the fee based on the number of whole increments of 1,000 square feet of gross floor area plus a pro rated amount for the fractional portion of any square footage increment. For example, the amount shall be calculated as follows for an office building with 3,100 square feet of gross floor area: The fee is assessed at $187.00 per increment of 1,000 square feet of gross floor area. Since there are 3,100 square feet, the fee amount to be paid shall be calculated based on three increments of 1,000 square feet plus one-tenth of a 1,000 square foot increment. The calculation is three increments of 1,000 square feet GFA x $187.00 per increment, plus the one-tenth x $187.00. 
(d)  The building official is hereby delegated the authority to compute the impact fee due and payable pursuant to this section 10.42. 
(e)  Upon rendition of any determination made pursuant to this section, an appeal may be made to the planning and zoning board pursuant to section 10.46.

    The fees paid pursuant to this article shall be segregated and held in trust by the city in its public facilities impact fee fund.

The funds collected shall be used only to acquire, construct, or provide police, fire, or general administrative facilities needed or anticipated as a result of the new development.

Editor's note- Section 13 of Ord. No. 2015-45, adopted Sept. 8, 2015, changed the title of art. VIII from "Building Board of Adjustment and Appeals" to read as herein set out. 

Sec. 13.143. - Appeals. 
    Consistent with section 2-329 of this Code, the planning and zoning board shall have the authority to hear appeals of decisions and interpretations of the building official and consider variances of the technical codes as specifically authorized in Code. 
(a)  Appeals of decisions of the building official. 
(1)  Appeal. The owner of a building, structure or service system, or his duly authorized agent, may appeal a decision of the building official to the planning and zoning board whenever any of the following conditions exist: 
a.  The building official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system. 
b.  The provisions of this chapter do not apply to the specific case. 
c.  An equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific case. 
d.  The true intent or meaning of this chapter or any of the regulations thereunder have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted. 
(2)  Variance. The planning and zoning board, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of this chapter to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this or the technical codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
b.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant. 
c.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other buildings, structures, or service systems. 
d.  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system. 
e.  That granting the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(3)  Conditions of the variance. In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this code. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of the code. 
(4)  Method of appeal. Any person who desires to appeal a final decision made by the building official may file a written notice of appeal within 30 days after the decision is rendered by the building official to the building official and the secretary to the planning and zoning board. Such appeal must specify the grounds for the appeal. Immediately following receipt of an appeal, the building official shall immediately transmit to the secretary to the planning and zoning board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The secretary to the planning and zoning board after receipt of the record shall fix a time for hearing of the appeal. The planning and zoning board shall make a determination on the appeal within 60 days of such application for appeal. The term rendered shall mean the date on which a signed, written decision of the building official is filed in his records. 
Any person who desires to appeal a final decision made by the planning and zoning board must follow the process in section 2-331 of this Code. 
(5)  Unsafe or dangerous buildings or service systems. In the case of a building, structure or service system which, in the opinion of the building official, is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building official may, in his order, limit the time for such appeals to a shorter period. 
(b)  Limitations on authority. An application for appeal shall be based on a claim that the true intent of the Florida Building Code or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been incorrectly interpreted, the provisions of the Florida Building Code do not fully apply, or an equally good or better form of construction is proposed. The planning and zoning board shall have no authority to waive the requirements of the Florida Building Code.

ARTICLE IX. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT CODE 

Sec. 13.150. - Administration - general. 
(a)  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Code of the City of Melbourne. 
(b)  Scope. The provisions of this floodplain management code will apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(c)  Intent. The purposes of this floodplain management code and the flood load and flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(d)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. the flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance. 
(f)  Disclaimer of liability. This floodplain management code shall not create liability on the part of the city council of the city or by any officer or employee thereof, in their official or individual/personal capacities, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2013-02, § 11(13.150), 1-22-2013) 
Sec. 13.151. - Applicability. 
(a)  General. In this article where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
(b)  Areas to which this floodplain management code applies. This floodplain management code will apply to all flood hazard areas within the city, as established in subsection 13.151(c), appendix D, of this floodplain management code. 
(c)  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance Study for Brevard County, Florida and Incorporated Areas dated November 19, 1997, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this code and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the office of the city building official. 
(d)  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to section 105 of this ordinance the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
(1)  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this floodplain management code and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(2)  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(e)  Other laws. The provisions of this floodplain management code will not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
(f)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This floodplain management code supersedes any code in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing code including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning code provisions, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this floodplain management code and any other code provisions , the more restrictive shall govern. This floodplain management code shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this ordinance. 
(g)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this code, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

    That the Grantor shall in no way be liable or responsible for any accident, personal injury, property damage or any claim or damage that may occur in the construction, installation, operation, removal, repair, relocation, or maintenance by the Grantee, its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, sublessees or licensees of any of the Grantee's facilities or operations, or that may occur as the result of any omission to do any of the foregoing by the Grantee, its employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, sublessees or licensees, in connection with or relation to its facilities hereunder. The acceptance of the franchise granted pursuant to this New Franchise Agreement by the Grantee shall be deemed an agreement on the part of the Grantee to indemnify the Grantor, its officials, employees, and agents, and hold it harmless against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense which may accrue to the Grantor by reason of the negligence, default or misconduct of the Grantee or other third party arising from the construction, installation, operation, removal, repair, or maintenance of its facilities hereunder. The Grantor agrees that neither it nor its officers, employees, or agents, all in their official capacity, shall be indemnified to the percentage of its or their fault in an accident or other occurrence that Grantor or its officers, employees, agents, or volunteers, all in their official capacity, is responsible for in any incident for damages or injuries (including but not limited to injury or death) arising from the gross negligence and wanton, willful, and intentional misconduct of the Grantor or its officers, employees, agent, or volunteers. For an additional Ten Dollars ($10.00) paid to the Grantee, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by the Grantee, the Grantee agrees that it has received sufficient consideration for its agreement to indemnify the Grantor as set forth above. 
SECTION 4. -   
    Notice to Grantor of Proposed Changes in Rules or Rates. That except as otherwise provided by this Franchise Agreement, all rates and rules and regulations established by the Grantee from time to time shall be subject to such regulation as may be provided by law. 
SECTION 5(a). - Consideration for Franchise. 
    That as a consideration for this franchise, the Grantee shall pay to the Grantor, commencing 90 days after the effective date hereof, and each month thereafter for the remainder of the term of this Franchise Agreement, an amount which, when added to the amount of all licenses, excises, fees, charges and other impositions of any kind whatsoever (except ad valorem property taxes and non-ad valorem tax assessments on property) levied or imposed by the Grantor against the Grantee's property, business or operations and those of its subsidiaries during the Grantee's monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment will equal to 5.9% of the Grantee's billed revenues, less actual write-offs, from sales of electrical energy within the incorporated areas of the Grantor for the monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment, and in no event shall payment for the rights and privileges granted herein exceed 5.9% of such revenues for any monthly billing period of the Grantee. 
    The Grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in the preceding paragraph are limited, as in the existing franchise Ordinance No. 72-28, amended by Ordinance No. 78-07, to the precise revenues described therein, and that such revenues do not include, by way of example and not limitation: (a) revenues from the sale of electrical energy for public Street and Highway Lighting (service for lighting public ways and areas); (b) revenues from Other Sales to Public Authorities (service with eligibility restricted to governmental entities); (c) revenues from Sales to Railroads and railways (service supplied for propulsion of electric transit vehicles); (d) revenues from Sales for Resale (service to other utilities for resale purposes); (e) franchise fees; (f) Late Payment Charges; (g) Field Collection Charges; (h) other service charges. 
SECTION 5(b). -   
    That if during the term of this franchise the Grantee enters into a franchise agreement with any other municipality located in Brevard County, Florida or within any contiguous county to Brevard County, where the number of Grantee's active electrical customers is 50,000 or less than the number of Grantee's active electrical customers within the incorporated area of the Grantor, the terms of which provide for the payment of franchise fees by the Grantee at a rate greater than 5.9% of the Grantee's residential, commercial and industrial revenues (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff), under the same terms and conditions as specified in Section 5(a) hereof, the Grantee, upon written request of the Grantor, shall negotiate and enter into a new franchise agreement with the Grantor in which the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments under Section 5(a) hereof shall be equal to that percentage which the Grantee has agreed to use as a basis for the calculation of payments to such other municipality described above, provided, however, that such new franchise agreement shall include additional benefits to the Grantee, in addition to all benefits provided herein, equal to those provided by its franchise agreement with such other municipality described above. Subject to all limitations, terms and conditions specified in the preceding sentence, the Grantor shall have the sole discretion to determine the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments, and the Grantee shall have the sole discretion to determine those benefits to which it would be entitled, under any such new Franchise Agreement. 
SECTION 6. - Consideration; Non-Competition by City in the Provision of Electric Service. 
    That as a further consideration, during the term of this Franchise Agreement or any extension thereof, the Grantor agrees: (a) not to engage in the distribution and/or sale, in competition with the Grantee, of electric capacity and/or electric energy to any ultimate consumer of electric utility service (herein called a "retail customer") or to any electrical distribution system established solely to serve any retail customer formerly served by the Grantee, (b) not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement, the purpose or terms of which would be to obligate the Grantee to transmit and/or distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third party(ies) to any other retail customer's facility(ies); and (c) not to seek to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute electric capacity and/or electric energy generated by or on behalf of the Grantor at one location to the Grantor's facility(ies) at any other location(s). Nothing specified herein shall prohibit the Grantor from engaging with other utilities or persons in wholesale transactions which are subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act. 
    Nothing herein shall prohibit the Grantor, if permitted by law, (i) from purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, or (ii) from seeking to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute to any facility(ies) of the Grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased by the Grantor from any other person; provided, however, that before the Grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee. Such notice shall include a summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by the other person and identify the Grantor's facilities to be served under the offer. The Grantee shall thereafter have 90 days to evaluate the offer and, if the Grantee offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the other person, the Grantor shall be obligated to continue to purchase from the Grantee electric capacity and/or electric energy on such equal or better terms to serve the previously-identified facilities of the Grantor for a term no shorter than that offered by the other person. If the Grantee does not agree to rates, terms and conditions which equal or better the other person's offer, then Grantor may proceed with the other person's offered sale and purchase arrangement and all of the terms and conditions of this Franchise Agreement shall remain in effect except as otherwise provided herein. 
SECTION 7. - Grantor's Approval of Competing Electric Service. 
    That if the Grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person or otherwise enables any other such person to construct, operate or maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve or compete on terms and conditions which the Grantee reasonably determines are more favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, the Grantee may at any time thereafter terminate this Franchise Agreement if such terms and conditions are not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least 150 days advance written notice, of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of such terms and conditions that it considers more favorable and the objective basis or bases of the claimed competitive disadvantage. The Grantor shall then have 150 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the terms and conditions complained of by the Grantee. If the Grantee reasonably determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this Franchise Agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall be effective on the date of delivery of such notice. 
SECTION 8. - Legal or Regulatory Change Authorizing Retail Competition in the Sale of Electricity. 
    That if as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory or other action by the United States of America or the State of Florida (or any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the incorporated areas of the Grantor to a customer then being served by the Grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve, and the Grantee reasonably determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting from this Franchise Agreement in respect to rates and service, place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the Grantee may, at any time after the taking of such action, terminate this Franchise Agreement if such competitive disadvantage is, in the reasonable determination of the Grantee, not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least 150 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of the specific consequences of such action which resulted in the competitive disadvantage, and the objective basis or bases of the competitive disadvantage. The Grantor shall then have 150 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the competitive disadvantage. If such competitive disadvantage is, in the reasonable determination of the Grantee, not remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this Franchise Agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall take effect on the date of delivery of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon written request of the Grantor within the 150 day period for a face to face meeting between representatives of the Grantor and Grantee, Grantee agrees that it shall meet with Grantor prior to terminating the franchise agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as constraining Grantor's rights to legally challenge FPL's reasonable determination of competitive disadvantage leading to termination under Sections 7 and/or 8. 
SECTION 9. - Default. 
    That failure on the part of the Grantee to comply in any substantial or material respect with any of the provisions of this Franchise Agreement shall be grounds for forfeiture of this franchise, but no such forfeiture of this franchise shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is protested by the Grantee until there is a final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Grantee has failed to comply in a substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the Grantee shall have six months after such final determination to make good the default before a forfeiture shall result with the right of the Grantor at its discretion to grant such additional time to the Grantee for compliance as necessities in the case require. Such final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any final appellate determination or ruling, shall allow Grantor to proceed with its choice of remedies, provided, however, that the Grantor may, in its discretion, grant such additional time to the Grantee for compliance as the Grantor determines are in the best interests of Grantor and Grantor's citizens. Non-substantial or non-material defaults or failures by the Grantee shall be remediable pursuant to any available legal remedies. 
SECTION 10. - Grantee's Remedies in the Event of Defaults by Grantor. 
    That failure on the part of the Grantor to comply in any substantial or material respect with any of the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to: (a) denying the Grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic; (b) imposing conditions for use of public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law or the terms and conditions of this Franchise Agreement; (c) unreasonable delay in issuing the Grantee a right-of-use permit, if any, to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, shall constitute breach of this Franchise Agreement and entitle the Grantee to withhold all or part of the payments provided for in Section 5 hereof until such time as a use permit is issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has reached a final determination in the matter. The Grantor recognizes and agrees that nothing in this Franchise Agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the Grantee's sovereign right of condemnation and that the Grantee, in its sole discretion, may exercise such right. 
SECTION 11. - Termination and Renewal. 
    That the Grantor and Grantee agree that the New Franchise Agreement created by this ordinance and Grantee's acceptance hereof, shall terminate by its own terms at 12:01 a.m. thirty (30) years after the effective date of the Franchise Agreement. 
SECTION 12. - Examination or Audit of Grantee's Records; Waiver of Claims. 
    That the Grantor may, upon reasonable notice and within 90 days after each anniversary date of this Franchise Agreement, at the Grantor's expense, examine the records of the Grantee relating to the calculation of the franchise payment for the year preceding such anniversary date. Such examination shall be during normal business hours at the Grantee's office where such records are maintained; provided that, in all events, Grantee agrees that all said records shall be made available at Grantee's expense to Grantor in Palm Beach County, Dade or Brevard County, Florida. Records not prepared by the Grantee in the ordinary course of business may be provided at the Grantor's expense and as the Grantor and the Grantee may agree in writing. Information identifying the Grantee's customers by name or their electric consumption shall not be taken from the Grantee's premises. Such audit shall be impartial and all audit findings, whether they decrease or increase payment to the Grantor, shall be reported to the Grantee. The Grantor's right to examine the records of the Grantee in accordance with this Section shall not be conducted by any third party employed by the Grantor whose fee, in whole or part, for conducting such audit is contingent on findings of the audit. 
    Grantor may, upon reasonable notice given within one year following the Grantee's acceptance of this New Franchise Agreement, conduct a final audit of the Grantee's records relating to the calculation of the franchise payments that have been made to Grantor pursuant to the Current Franchise Agreement embodied in Ordinances No. 72-28 and No. 78-07. Other than any claims arising from alleged fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, intentional withholding of information, or other similar intentional misconduct by Grantee in relation to the calculation or remittance of the franchise payments under the Current Franchise Agreement, Grantor waives, settles and bars all claims relating to the amounts paid by the Grantee under the Current Franchise Agreement embodied in Ordinances No. 72-28 and No. 78-07. Grantor agrees that this instrument waives, settles and bars any claim by Grantee, its successors or assigns of, and any right of Grantee, its successors or assigns to claim, a breach, material or otherwise, of the franchise by the Grantor embodied in Ordinance Nos. 72-28 and No. 78-07. 
SECTION 13. - Annexation. 
    That upon the Grantor's annexation of any property and appropriate written notice to Grantee, the portion of Grantee's electrical system located within such annexed territory, and in, under, over, and upon the streets, alleys, rights-of-way, or public grounds of such annexed territory, shall be subject to all the terms of this New Franchise Agreement within ninety (90) days of the Grantee's receiving written notice by U.S. certified mail return receipt requested of such annexation from the Grantor, which notice shall include the legal description(s) of the property annexed and the addresses of the individual properties within the annexed property to the extent that information is available to the City. 
SECTION 14. - Severability; Invalidation of Portions of Ordinance. 
    That if any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding in no way affects the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly provided that if any of the provisions of Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 are found or adjudged to be invalid, void or of not effect, the ordinance shall be null and void and of no force and effect. 
SECTION 15. - Repeal of Prior Franchise Ordinances. 
    That Ordinance No. 72-28, passed and adopted September 19, 1972, Ordinance No. 78-07, passed and adopted on January 31, 1978, and all other ordinances and parts of ordinances and all resolutions and parts of resolutions in conflict herewith, are hereby repealed.

    That this New Franchise Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the laws of the United States and of the State of Florida, and venue shall be in Brevard County, Florida.

SECTION 18. - Waiver.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any failure or delay by another party in asserting any of its rights or remedies as to any default shall not operate as a waiver of any default or of any such rights or remedies or deprive such party of its right to institute and maintain any actions or proceedings which it may deem necessary to protect, assert or enforce any such rights or remedies.

    That this ordinance was passed on the first reading at a regular meeting of the City Council on the 28 th day of August, 2007, and adopted on the second/final reading at a regular meeting of the City Council on the 11 th day of September, 2007.

(c)  The Company shall at all times comply with and be subject to any ordinance and all ordinances of the City, now or hereafter in existence, relating to the use of the streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, highways, bridges, easements and other public ways and places, not inconsistent with this Franchise.

Wherever possible, pipe lines shall be installed without cutting the pavement. 
SECTION 6. - Quality of Materials and Corrosion Protection. 
    All construction made under the provision of this Ordinance shall contain quality materials meeting all industry standards, and all piping in the system shall be protected externally from corrosion by approved methods and materials.

SECTION 9. - Service Standards.

SECTION 10. - Obligation of the Company to Extend Service. 
(a)  The Company shall promptly make such reasonable extensions of mains and service pipes as may be ordered by the City Council of the City of Melbourne. Such extensions shall be made at the cost and expense of the Company provided there is an average of one additional consumer to each 200 feet of mains included in such extension. When there is less than one consumer to each 200 feet of proposed extended mains, the Company will not be required to make such extension until the applicant for service along such extension shall have deposited with the Company a sum of money sufficient to cover the cost of any length of the extension in excess of the length in feet of 200 times the number of additional consumers served thereby; the sum to be deposited by the applicant for such extension to be subject to the approval of the City Engineer as to cost. In such cases, the Company shall refund to the applicant the cost of 200 feet of main as each additional consumer on said line is served until the entire amount deposited shall have been refunded. The gas mains and equipment, and all appurtenances included in such extension shall be and remain the property of the Company. 
(b)  As a temporary expedient in the event gas mains cannot be laid as aforesaid, and with the consent of the user thereof and the Company, the Company may install in lieu of mains and pipes lines such fixtures and appurtenances as will serve the householder, business, factory, or otherwise with the gas from tanks placed upon the individual premises and generally known as "bottled gas" assemblies, but such service shall be changed by the Company upon laying of mains as set forth in this Franchise. This consumer so connected shall still constitute an additional customer until connected to the natural gas system of the City for the purpose of this extension section. 
(c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to connect to the facilities of the Company. 
SECTION 11. - Insurance. 
    Prior to the effective date of this Franchise, the Company shall file with the City Clerk and shall keep in full force and effect at all times during the effective period hereof, insurance certificates evidencing a liability insurance policy or policies, the terms and conditions whereof shall be such as to provide for the protection and indemnification of the City with respect to any and all legally valid claims of any persons suffering injury, loss, or damage to person or property by reason of the construction or operation of a gas distribution system within the territorial limits of the City. 
    Such insurance policy(ies) shall be subject to the acceptance of and approval by the City Manager. Each such policy shall be issued by a company licensed to conduct insurance business in the State of Florida and having a financial rating in Best's Insurance Guide of AAA or better. Any excess policy used must be issued by underwriters acceptable to the City. Such policy(ies) shall aggregate, as a minimum, the sum of $5,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury, or death, and/or property damage resulting from any one accident or occurrence, and such aggregate minimum sums shall remain in full force and shall be undiminished during the effective period of this Franchise. 
    Every such insurance policy shall contain a provision whereby every company executing the same shall obligate itself to notify the City Manager in writing, at least thirty (30) days before any material alteration or modification, or before cancellation of such policy is to become effective.
