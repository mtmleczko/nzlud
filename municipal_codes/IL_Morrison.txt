PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Morrison, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through March 22, 2009, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Ricardo Lewis, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit property into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.

(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may:

(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ through _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted in the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-10. - Effect of repeal of ordinances. 
(a)  When any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or provision shall be itself repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive such former ordinance, clause or provision unless it shall be in the ordinance so expressly provided. 
(b)  The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed or cause of action arising under the ordinance repealed. 
State Law reference- Similar provision, 5 ILCS 70/3. 
Sec. 1-11. - Effective date of ordinances. 
(a)  All ordinances of the council required to be published shall take effect ten days after the publication thereof, and all other ordinances, resolutions, and orders shall take effect and be in force from and after their passage unless otherwise therein provided. 
(b)  The ordinances of the city, when published in book form by authority of the council, shall be deposited in the office of the city clerk. He shall deliver one copy thereof to each officer of the city, and to such other persons as the mayor or council shall direct. The mayor, city attorney, or city clerk shall have power to extend to or reciprocate courtesies of other cities, by presenting to them a copy of the ordinances in such manner as may seem suitable. 
State Law reference- Effective date of statutes, 5 ILCS 75/0.01 et seq.; effective date of ordinances, 65 ILCS 5/1-2-4. 
Sec. 1-12. - Publication of penal ordinances.

(a)  The purpose of this article is to comply with 16 CFR 681.2 in order to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft by identifying and detecting identity theft red flags and by responding to such red flags in a manner that will prevent identity theft. Pursuant to 16 CFR 681.1, the purpose of this article is also to establish a process by which the city will be able to form a reasonable belief that a consumer report relates to the consumer about whom it has requested a consumer credit report when the city has received a notice of address discrepancy. 
(b)  This article may be referred to as the city's identity theft prevention program or ITTP. 
Sec. 2-669. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Covered account means: 
(1)  An account that a creditor offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions, such as a credit card account, mortgage loan, automobile loan, margin account, cell phone account, utility account, checking account, or savings account; and 
(2)  Any other account that the creditor offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or litigation risks. 
    Credit means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debts and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and defer payment therefor. 
    Creditor means any person or entity who regularly extends, renews, or continues credit; any person who regularly arranges for the extension, renewal, or continuation of credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the decision to extend, renew, or continue credit and includes utility companies and telecommunications companies. For the purposes of this article, the city is a creditor. 
    Customer means a person that has a covered account with a creditor. 
    Department head means any department head who works at the discretion of the city council, any elected official, and any individual appointed to manage a department on a permanent or temporary basis.

Sec. 2-670. - Findings.

(2)  The processes of opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account, making payments on such accounts, and making payments for property taxes and other services have been identified as potential processes in which identity theft could occur. 
(3)  The city limits access to personal identifying information to those employees responsible for or otherwise involved in opening or restoring covered accounts or accepting payment for use of covered accounts. 
(4)  The city determines that there is a low risk of identity theft occurring in the following ways, (if any): 
a.  Use by an applicant of another person's personal identifying information to establish a new covered account; 
b.  Use of a previous customer's personal identifying information by another person in an effort to have service restored in the previous customer's name; 
c.  Use of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment by a customer to pay such customer's covered account; and 
d.  Use by a customer desiring to restore such customer's covered account of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment. 
Sec. 2-671. - Process of establishing a covered account.

The applicant shall also provide any other information necessary for the department providing the service for which the covered account is created. The information shall be entered directly into the city's records system and held in a secure storage area with access limited to those city personnel with the need to know. 
(b)  For each customer account for which the city may now or hereafter provide individual customer access to the customer's account information, such account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account.

Sec. 2-672. - Password required for access to covered account information. 
    Access to any customer account that includes personal identifying information shall be password protected and shall be limited to authorized city personnel. Passwords shall be changed by the head of the department providing the service for which the covered account is created, or by such other city employee authorized to carry out the provisions of this article, on a regular basis.

ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION CONTROL 

Sec. 18-1. - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to diminish threats to public health, safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and river resources. The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land and as such this article regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts. This article is adopted to accomplish the following objectives: 
(1)  To assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(2)  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff; 
(3)  To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed basis; 
(4)  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development; 
(5)  To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
(6)  To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats; 
(7)  To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development.

    The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse water quality impacts downstream and on the property itself. Retention and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants. 
    The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-6. - Design criteria, standards, and methods. 
(a)  Release rates. The drainage system for a property shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for a two-year and 100-year event of durations producing the maximum peak stormwater discharge to levels which will not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. The peak discharge from events less than or equal to the two-year event shall not be greater than 0.25 cfs per acre of property drained. The peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than 0.80 cfs of property drained. 
    In the event the downstream drainage systems are inadequate to receive the release rate herein above provided, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the receiving downstream sewers, streams, and channels; this means that additional detention may be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers, streams, and channels. 
    In no case shall the peak discharge of any storm event of the developed site exceed the same event peak discharge of the pre-developed site. 
(b)  Storage facility outlet design. Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet. 
(c)  Benchmark. A permanent reference elevation benchmark shall be established in the vicinity of the stormwater drainage facility. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-6.5. - Site runoff storage requirements. 
    The design maximum storage to be provided in a site runoff storage facility shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour event and reservoir routing (also called level pool) or equal. Site runoff storage shall be computed using hydrograph methods as described in this article. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-7. - Drainage system design and evaluation. 
    The criteria specified in sections 18-7.1 through 18-7.9 following shall be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity to pass the ten-year peak flow in the minor drainage system and an overland flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-7.1. - Design methodologies. 
    Major and minor conveyance systems for areas up to ten acres may be designed using the rational formula. The rational formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites. Runoff hydrograph methods as described in section 18-7.2 must be used for major drainage system design for all systems with greater than ten acres of drainage area and for the design of all site runoff storage facilities, where required by the director of public works. 
(1)  Positive drainage. Whenever practicable, all areas of the property must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the minor drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street ponding and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-7.2. - Methods for generating runoff hydrograph. 
    Acceptable event hydrograph methods are HEC-HMS, HEC-1 (SCS runoff method), TR-20, or TR-55. A runoff hydrograph shall be developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and antecedent moisture. 
(1)  Rainfall. All design runoff calculations shall utilize the Illinois State Water Survey's Bulletin 71 rainfall amounts for given storm frequencies. All design runoff calculations, except TR-55, shall utilize Bulletin 71 median time distributions for given storm frequencies. If TR-55 is used, the SCS Type II time distribution shall be used. The SCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff distributions. 
(2)  Antecedent moisture. Computations of runoff hydrographs shall assume a normal Antecedent Moisture Condition (AMC=2) as defined by Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Technical Release 55 as a minimum. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-7.3. - Wet detention basin design. 
    Wet detention basins shall be designed to be safe, aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for recreational use. 
(1)  Wet basin depths. Wet basins shall be at least five feet deep, excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25 percent of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out. 
(2)  Wet basin shoreline slopes. The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than four to one (4:1) (horizontal to vertical). 
(3)  Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the two-year event. 
(4)  Inlet and outlet orientation. To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-7.4. - Dry detention basin design. 
    In addition to the other requirements of this article, dry basins shall be designed to be safe and aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses. 
(1)  Dry basin drainage. Dry basins shall be designed so that 80 percent of their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Under drains directed to the outlet control shall be used, if necessary, to accomplish this requirement. Dry basins shall have a minimum ground slope of one percent. 
(2)  Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants. 
(3)  Inlet and outlet orientation. To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
(4)  Low flow discharge. Dry bottom basins shall provide for a low-flow, by-pass system to accommodate low intensity storms. The low-flow, by-pass system or systems shall be constructed of suitable pipe with an inside diameter equal, in aggregate, to the carrying capacity of the outlet pipe but not less than six inches. Cleanouts, manholes, or catch basins shall be appropriately placed in the low-flow by-pass system and all changes in direction or slope to facilitate cleaning. Under drains installed under the bottom of a detention area shall be perforated and covered on all sides with a minimum of six inches of porous granular material, CA18 in accordance with the Illinois Standard Specification for Road and Bridge Construction. Whenever detention or retention basins are also intended for public acceptance, under drainage systems shall be installed. 
(5)  Minimum detention outlet size. Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of four inches. If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater than those specified in this section, and regional detention is not a practical alternative, alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which incorporate self-cleaning flow restrictions. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-7.5. - Detention in floodplain. 
    The placement of detention basins within the floodplain are discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention requirements of this article may be fulfilled if the following provisions are met. 
(1)  Detention in flood fringe areas. The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for one and two-tenths times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all streamflow and floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. 
(2)  Detention in floodways. Detention basins shall be placed in the floodway only in accordance with subsection 18-7.5(3). 
(3)  On-stream detention. On-stream detention basins are discouraged but allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this article with respect to water quality and control of the two-year and 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are presented in section 18-7.7 of this article. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger than one square mile, the applicant shall perform hydrologic modeling and demonstrate that the design will not increase high water elevation for any properties upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention: 
a.  Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
b.  Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat; 
c.  Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands; 
d.  Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge; and 
e.  Shall comply with Part 92 of the Illinois Administrative Code Parts 702, and chapter 18, article II, floodplain area development, and chapter 18, article III, flood hazard area regulations of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013)

    To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement shall be located on soils in hydrologic soil groups "A" or "B" as designated by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to recharge groundwater shall not be located within 75 feet of a water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over 80 percent of a dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet above seasonally high groundwater and bedrock. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-7.8. - Safety considerations. 
    All drainage system components, especially detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events. 
(1)  Side slopes. The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than four to one (4:1) (horizontal to vertical). 
(2)  Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least four feet in width at a level not less than two and one-half to three feet below the normal water depth.

(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-10. - Early completion of detention facilities. 
    Where detention, or retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of the facilities. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-11. - Fee in lieu of on-site detention. 
(a)  The city may require, or the applicant may request, the payment of a fee-in-lieu of on-site detention to fulfill all or part of the on-site detention requirements for a development. The city will request a fee-in-lieu of on-site detention or will reject its use within 30 days of the pre-application meeting unless additional engineering studies are required. 
(b)  The city may reject any request to use a fee-in-lieu of on-site detention by the applicant which the city determines does not benefit the drainage system. 
(c)  Fee-in-lieu of on-site detention shall be the estimated cost as verified by the city of the applicant's proposed and approved on-site detention, including land costs had the city allowed its construction. 
(d)  A fund will be maintained for the purpose of identifying and controlling all revenues and expenses derived from stormwater drainage services resulting from fee-in-lieu of on-site detention exemptions. All fees-in-lieu of on-site detention received from each watershed shall be deposited in this fund. Disbursements for cost to mitigate stormwater impacts of developments shall be made from this fund. 
(e)  Criteria. The following requirements must be met before a fee-in-lieu of on-site detention will be utilized: 
(1)  The downstream drainage system has adequate stormwater capacity; 
(2)  The elimination of on-site detention facilities is consistent with an approved stormwater master plan or the city determines that such an exemption will not result in negative impacts to the drainage system. 
(Ord. No. 13-31, § 2, 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 18-12. - Maintenance responsibility. 
(a)  Maintenance of facilities. Maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner(s) of that property. Before a building permit is obtained from the city the applicant shall execute a maintenance agreement with the city guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its stormwater drainage system. The maintenance agreement shall also specifically authorize representatives of the city to enter onto the property for the purpose of inspections and maintenance of the drainage system. Such agreement shall be recorded with the recorder of deeds of Whiteside County. The maintenance agreement shall include an operation and maintenance plan providing for the maintenance of each aspect of the property's stormwater drainage system and shall provide for access to the system for inspection by authorized personnel of the city. The maintenance agreement shall also stipulate that if the appropriate authorized personnel of the city notify the property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner shall make such corrections within 30 calendar days of such notification. If the corrections are not made within this time period, the city may take legal action against the owner(s) or have the necessary work completed and assess the cost to the property owner(s), to include court costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the city with respect to any such legal action to enforce the maintenance agreement and/or to recover the cost of the completion of the necessary work. 
(b)  Operation and maintenance plan. An operation and maintenance plan shall be filed with the director of public works. As a minimum, the operation and maintenance plan must address the following activities: 
(1)  Structural repairs; 
(2)  Dredging operations;

    The standards applied by the commission for a certificate of appropriateness shall be: 
(1)  For demolition, addition, alteration, maintenance, rehabilitation, renovation or repair, the federal secretary of the interior's "Standards for Rehabilitation" as follows: 
a.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site environment; 
b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided; 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken; 
d.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved; 
e.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity; 
f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities, and, where possible materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence; 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of the structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible; 
h.  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken; 
i.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment; 
j.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(2)  For demolition due to an assertion of an imminent threat to life, health, or property: 
a.  That the property's present condition poses an immediate and impending peril to the safety of people or property within a zone of danger; 
b.  That all reasonable efforts have been made to discern the best available costs of repair, rehabilitation, restoration or movement; and 
c.  That the financial burdens of repair, rehabilitation, restoration or movement presented, when weighed against the inherent worth of perpetuation and the longer term economics of preservation, clearly and convincingly favor demolition. 
(3)  For reconstruction due to partial or complete natural destruction of a site or structure within a historic district or of a landmark, although exact duplication of the previous structure may not be required, the exterior design of the property shall be in harmony with the exterior design of the structure prior to damage, and, if applicable, the character of the historic district.

    Within the meaning and intent of this article, each of the following which is supplied with service by the combined waterworks and sewage system of the city, either both water and sewerage service or either of them, is designated as a separate user: every separate professional or business office, store, place of business, manufacturing establishment, lodge, club, hotel, hospital, public building, private dwelling home, private apartment, boardinghouse, roominghouse or church contained in any building or situated or located upon any lot, piece or parcel of ground within the corporate limits of the city. 
(Code 1977, § 13.32.010; Ord. No. 88-1, 1988) 
Sec. 56-291. - Basis of use charges. 
    The charges for the use of and for service supplied by the combined waterworks and wastewater system of the city shall consist of the following: a water service charge, water use charge, an electrical surcharge, a wastewater debt service charge, and a wastewater service charge. The adequacy of the user charge shall be reviewed annually and shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in operation, maintenance and/or replacement costs. 
(1)  Water service charge. The water service charge shall be a minimum charge assessed against each user connected to the municipal waterworks system by a separate service line when the water has not been turned off by the city water department. 
(2)  Water use charge. The water use charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meter readings and shall be computed by multiplying the water usage exceeding 1,000 gallons per billing period by a water use rate developed as follows: 
a.  Estimate the projected annual revenue, less the projected revenue to be derived from the minimum water service charge, required to operate and maintain the water distribution system facilities including a replacement account and to make debt service payments for outstanding waterworks and sewage bonds; 
b.  Estimate the projected annual billable water volume from past meter reading records; 
c.  Develop a decreasing step rate which will generate the revenue required to operate and maintain the water distribution system including replacement costs and debt service requirements. 
(3)  Surcharges. 
a.  Electrical surcharge. There shall be added to each water use bill an electrical surcharge based upon a base surcharge of 21/2 cents per 1,000 gallons of metered water during a billing period. This surcharge shall increase only upon an increase of the electrical energy charges assessed against the city over the Commonwealth Edison rate in effect October 23, 1985. 
b.  Improvements and extensions. There shall be added to each monthly water use bill a surcharge in an amount of $1.62 for the purpose of providing funds necessary to meet planned improvements and/or extensions to the city's water distribution system. 
(4)  Wastewater debt service charge. The wastewater debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the average annual debt service of all outstanding wastewater bonds by the number of users. Through further divisions, the monthly wastewater debt service charge can be computed. 
(5)  Wastewater service charge. The wastewater service charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or wastewater meter readings and shall consist of a basic wastewater charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement; and, if applicable, a wastewater surcharge. 
a.  Basic wastewater charge. 
1.  The basic wastewater charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal concentrations: 
(i)  A five-day, 20 degree Celsius biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/l; 
(ii)  A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 mg/l; 
2.  It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed by multiplying the water and/or wastewater usage per billing period by a wastewater user rate which is developed as follows: 
(i)  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund; 
(ii)  Estimate the projected annual billable water and/or wastewater volumes from past meter reading records; 
(iii)  Compute the user rate by dividing the annual operation, maintenance and replacement costs by the annual billable water volume. 
b.  Wastewater surcharge. A wastewater surcharge will be levied to all users whose wastewater exceeds the normal concentrations for BOD 5 (200 mg/l) and/or suspended solids (240 mg/l). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or wastewater meters for all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 240 mg/l concentration for BOD 5 and suspended solids respectively. The surcharge will be computed by multiplying the excess quantity of BOD 5 in pounds per billing period and/or the excess quantity of suspended solids in pounds per billing period by the unit treatment costs for BOD 5 and SS which shall be computed as follows: 
1.  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund; 
2.  Proportion annual OM&R costs to major wastewater treatment plant categories; 
3.  Proportion major wastewater treatment plant category costs to volume, BOD 5 and SS; 
4.  Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of BOD 5 and pounds of SS to be treated; 
5.  Compute unit treatment costs for volume (dollar per 1,000 gallons), for BOD 5 (dollars per pound) and for SS (dollar per pound).

DIVISION 3. - WASTEWATER CHARGES 

Sec. 56-365. - Basis, rates and charges for sewerage service. 
(a)  Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of the following: 
(1)  A wastewater service charge per month; 
(2)  A wastewater service charge covers the wastewater debt, and wastewater capital improvement. This fee, which does not vary based on customer type or usage level, covers only those expenses that benefit all customers equally (i.e., fixed costs that do not depend on the amount of water used). Examples of costs that fall into this category are monthly meter reading and billing, customer service, administrative salaries and benefits, insurances and basic costs of keeping the utility offices open. 
(3)  The wastewater use charges are assessed for every 1,000 gallons of water or wastewater per month. These charges recover variable costs that fluctuate based on the level of usage. Some examples of variable costs include electricity, chemicals, fuels and routine maintenance and repairs. 
(4)  A surcharge in addition to charges set out in subsections (a)(1) through (3) of this section will be levied upon all users whose discharges exceed the average strength sewage BOD 5 of 200 milligrams per liter or whose discharges exceed the average strength sewage concentrations for suspended solids of 240 milligrams per liter. The surcharge shall be based on metered sewage flow for all wastes which exceed those concentrations. The procedure for computation of a surcharge shall be in accordance with this subsection. The unit rates for BOD 5 and SS surcharge calculations shall be determined as follows: 
a.  The estimated annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater treatment facilities, including capital improvement and replacement shall be proportioned; 
b.  The costs for major plant categories relative to BOD 5 and SS shall be proportioned; 
c.  The total wastewater volume, pounds of BOD 5 and pounds of SS shall be estimated; and 
d.  The unit cost per pound of BOD 5 and SS shall be computed. 
Each user of the wastewater treatment facilities, by taking service and discharging waste into the wastewater treatment system of the city, shall be deemed to have consented for the city, from time to time and as frequently as determined necessary in the discretion of the superintendent of wastewater treatment department, to go upon the property of the user and take such samples as are deemed appropriate and necessary in order to determine the levels of BOD 5 and SS as are existent in the waste discharged by the user into the wastewater treatment facilities, for purposes of determining the applicability of the surcharge. 
(5)  The long-term plant replacement rate shall apply to all users, shall be for the purpose of creating a financial reserve from which can be paid a portion of the total cost of replacement of the sewer plant and shall be calculated by estimating the amount needed to create a reserve fund for the specific purpose of replacement of the sewer plant. 
(b)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing user charges shall be metered water consumption rounded to the next high even increment of 1,000 gallons of water. 
(1)  If the user discharging waste into the sanitary sewer system of the city procures any part, or all, of its water from sources other than the public waterworks systems of the city, all or part of which is discharged into the public sanitary sewer, the user shall, if directed by the superintendent, install and maintain, at the user's expense, water meters of a type approved by the superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. 
(2)  A device for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the superintendent if volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. 
(3)  A metering device for determining the volume of waste discharged into the public sanitary sewers shall be installed, owned and maintained by the user, if required by the superintendent. Following approval and installation, such meter may not be removed, unless service is canceled, without the written consent of the superintendent. 
(c)  Wastewater service rates and charges. There are hereby established monthly rates and charges for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater treatment system of the city and included in the fee schedule in chapter 20. (There is no charge for the first 1,000 gallons used.) 
(d)  Surcharge rates and charges. The rates of surcharge for BOD 5 and SS shall be as follows: 
(1)  For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ), $0.16 per pound of BOD 5 ; 
(2)  For suspended solids (SS), $0.14 per pound of SS. The surcharge per user shall be computed by the following formula: 
S = V (0.006238 [A (BOD 5  - 200) 
B (SS - 240)]) 
Where: 
S = Amount of surcharge in dollars 
V = Wastewater volume in 1,000 gallons per billing 
(0.006238) = Unit weight of water X 10 6 per 1,000 gallons cubic feet 
A = Unit charge for BOD 5 per pound, (subsection (d)(1) of this section) 
BOD 5  = Five-day biochemical oxygen demand, milligrams per liter 
200 = Allowable average BOD 5 concentration, milligrams per liter 
B = Unit charge for SS per pound (subsection (d)(2) of this section) 
SS = Suspended solids, milligrams per liter 
240 = Allowable average SS concentration, milligrams per liter 
(e)  Computation of wastewater service charge. Following is the procedure for calculating wastewater service charges for users located within the corporate limits: 
(1)  Metered users. The wastewater service charge for metered users shall be computed by the following formula: 
WC = D + B + (V - 300) R + S 
Where: 
WC = Amount of wastewater service charge per billing period 
D = Debt service for principal and interest in dollars for billing period 
B = Basic user charge for use of 1,000 gallons per billing period 
V = Wastewater volume in per billing rounded to the next highest increment. For wastewater volumes less than this part of the formula shall equal zero 
R = Basic user rate in dollars per 1,000 gallons per billing period 
S = Amount of wastewater surcharge in dollars as computed by the surcharge formulae (this subsection (e)) 
(2)  Nonmetered users. All nonmetered users of the wastewater facilities of the city shall pay a minimum flat rate charge, in lieu of calculation by formula of the debt service, basic user charge and basic user rate. The flat rate charge shall be as set out in subsection (c) of this section. The term "nonmetered user" shall mean a user not connected to the public water supply system and whose water consumption is not measured by an installed water usage recordation device. 
(3)  Multiple user. 
a.  A multiple user is defined as a building or premises with more than one family residential unit or more than one commercial unit located thereon, or a building or premises being serviced through a single water meter or sewer connection with multiple residential units or multiple commercial units located therein. Each multiple user shall be assessed an additional charge for each unit provided with sanitary service and served by the single connection and the additional charge shall be, for each unit in excess of one located in the same premises or building or served through the same connection. 
b.  Each minimum charge per unit shall allow the use of 1,000 gallons per month per unit, and, after determining the total allowance for the minimum charge, calculated by multiplying the number of units in the premises or building times 1,000 gallons per month, any total usage in excess of the total allowance shall be billed at the rate applicable for water or wastewater use charge. No pre-treatment as set forth in this section per 1,000 gallons or part thereof.

However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the city in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75 days after the submission of a completed application. 
The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of: (i) Ninety days after submission of the complete application; or (ii) Ten days after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the city. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the city's denial of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this article. 
(3)  New utility pole or wireless support structure. An application to collocate a small wireless facility that includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the city fails to approve or deny the application within 120 days after the submission of a completed application. 
However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the city in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 105 days after the submission of a completed application. 
The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of: (i) One hundred twenty days after submission of the complete application; or (ii) Ten days after receipt of the deemed approved notice by the city. Receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the city's denial of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this article. 
(4)  Denial of application. The city will deny an application that does not meet the requirements of this article. 
If the city determines that applicable codes, ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or the conditions contained in section 56-405 herein require that the utility pole or wireless support structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of the provider. 
The city shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the city denies an application. 
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without incurring an additional application fee. The city shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees, and recommencement of the city's review period. 
The applicant must notify the city in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with the revised application. 
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application review limitation does not apply if the cure of the deficiency cited in the prior denial requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. 
(5)  Small wireless facilities attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the city and the applicant shall enter into a master small wireless facilities attachment agreement, to be provided by the city, for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole by the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the city and the applicant shall enter into a license supplement of the master small wireless facilities attachment agreement. 
(d)  Application approval. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the city shall determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed complete if the city fails to provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in the city's permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the city. 
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the city sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information. 
(e)  Tolling period. The time period for applications may be further tolled by: 
(1)  An express written agreement by both the applicant and the city; or 
(2)  A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes the delay. 
(f)  Consolidated applications. An applicant shall be allowed to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. 
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the city may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless collocations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The city may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application. 
(g)  Permit duration. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the city makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable city codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this article. 
If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable city code provisions or regulations in effect at the time of renewal.

(1)  routine maintenance; 
(2)  the replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the city at least ten days prior to the planned replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment consistent with this article; or 
(3)  the installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes. 
    Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the city to work within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures. 
(Ord. No. 18-19, § 2, 7-23-2018) 
Sec. 56-405. - Collocation requirements and conditions. 
(a)  Public safety space reservation. The city may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the city's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the city reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate all such uses. 
(b)  Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
(c)  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. A wireless provider's operation of a small wireless facility shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
    Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
    If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
    The city, upon notice by the zoning administrator, may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
(d)  Prohibited areas. The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
    However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the city utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
    For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space," "communication worker safety zone," and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(e)  Compliance with applicable law. The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(f)  Design standards. The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a city ordinance, written policy adopted by the city, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. 
(g)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this section 56-405, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the city may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
    If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(h)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
    New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
(1)  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
(2)  Forty-five feet above ground level. 
(i)  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variance in writing to the zoning administrator as part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this article from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted. A variance request shall be submitted for each proposed small wireless facility that exceeds the above height limitations and shall be reviewed on a separate and independent basis. Any request for variance submitted to the city will be processed in accordance with article XI, chapter 32, section 327 et seq. 
(j)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(k)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. If such code or ordinance does not include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance, then the applicant shall be permitted to apply for a variance under the same conditions and restrictions as set forth in section 56-405(I) herein. 
(l)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or ordinances concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. If such code or ordinance does not include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance, then the applicant shall be permitted to apply for a variance under the same conditions and restrictions as set forth in section 56-405(I) herein. 
(m)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in writing to the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 18-19, § 2, 7-23-2018) 
Sec. 56-406. - Annual fee. 
    A wireless provider shall pay to the city an annual fee to collocate a small wireless facility on a city utility pole according to the following schedule: 
(a)  Located on the right-of-way. If the small wireless facility is collocated on a city utility pole located in the right-of-way, the wireless provider shall be charged an annual fee that equals the greater of (i) $200.00. per year; or (ii) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the city utility pole. 
(b)  Located outside the right-of-way. If the small wireless facility is collocated on a city utility pole located outside the right-of-way, the wireless provider shall be charged an annual fee that equals the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the city utility pole. The amount of the annual fee shall be fixed by resolution of the city council from time to time. 
    If the city has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the fee shall be $200.00 payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter. 
(Ord. No. 18-19, § 2, 7-23-2018) 
Sec. 56-407. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this article authorizes a person to collocate small wireless facilities on: 
(1)  Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by the city or another unit of local government that is not located within rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure without the consent of the property owner; 
(2)  Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or 
(3)  Property owned by a rail carrier registered under Section 18(c)-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility. The provisions of this Article do not apply to an electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of Section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act. 
    For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to that term in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this article shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement (a) to obtain a franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject to this article. 
(b)  Pre-existing agreements. Existing agreements between the city and wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on city utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small wireless facilities collocated on the city's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the city before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this Article. 
    A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the city on the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the city makes available under this article for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the city that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the city's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the city before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph. 
(c)  Abandonment. A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt of written notice from the city notifying the wireless provider of the abandonment. 
    The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the city to the owner at the last known address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days of such notice, the city may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery. 
    A wireless provider with facilities located in rights-of-way or on city owned utility poles shall provide written notice to the city if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the city. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless provider. 
(d)  Dispute resolution. The Circuit Court of Whiteside County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under this article. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the city shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than $200.00 per year per municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute. 
(e)  Indemnification. A wireless provider shall, as part of the written application, agree to indemnify and hold the city harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the city improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this article and the Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the city or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have against the city with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability. 
(f)  Insurance. The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance: 
(1)  Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all risks; 
(2)  Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or 
(3)  Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities on the city improvements or rights-of-way with limits not less than: (a) One million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person; and (b) One million dollars for property damage resulting from any one accident. The wireless provider shall include the city and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents and employees as additional insureds on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation of inclusion of such parties in a commercial general liability policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. 
    A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the city. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the city.

    This chapter's protection standard is the base flood. The best available base flood data are listed in this section. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party shall finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to FEMA and IDNR/OWR for approval prior to any development of the site. 
(1)  The base flood elevation for the SFHA of Rock Creek and French Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of the city prepared by FEMA and dated September 30, 1988. 
(2)  The base flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH zone" or "AO zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the city. 
(3)  The base flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHA's delineated as an "A zone" on the flood insurance rate map of the city shall be according to the best data available from federal, state, or other sources. When no base flood elevation exists, an engineering study must be financed to determine the base flood elevation. 
(4)  The base flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Whiteside County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of the county prepared by FEMA and dated February 19, 1986.

Sec. 62-99. - Development permit. 
    No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(1)  The application for a development permit shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to accurate dimensions showing property line dimensions; existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings when required by the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the zoning administrator shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not located in the SFHA and therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the provisions of this chapter. The zoning administrator shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(3)  The zoning administrator shall inform the applicant of any and all other local, state, and federal permits that may be required for this type of development activity. The zoning administrator shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained. 
(4)  Fees for issuance of development permits shall be in the amount provided in the city fee schedule.

    All work for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the zoning administrator or a duly authorized representative. Fees for inspections shall be as provided in the city fee schedule. It shall be unlawful to refuse to permit the zoning administrator or representative to enter such premises or structure at any reasonable time to make an inspection. It shall be unlawful to interfere with or hinder the zoning administrator or the representative when in the performance of their duties. 
(Code 1977, § 17.20.090; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-104. - Revocation of a permit. 
    The zoning administrator may revoke a permit in case there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application or plans on which the permit was based. The zoning administrator may revoke a permit when work is performed contrary to the provisions of the application or plans on which the permit is based. When a permit is revoked, the zoning administrator shall inform the applicant in writing of the specific steps the applicant must take in order to have the permit reissued. It shall be unlawful to continue any work authorized by a permit after revocation of that permit and until the permit is reissued or until a new permit is issued.

(1)  If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation, in addition to all other applicable penalties for violation of this Code the city may make application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. The city shall record a notice of violation on the title to the property. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. 
(3)  Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person responsible. 
(Code 1977, § 17.20.190; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-113. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    The ordinance from which this chapter is derived repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city council to fulfill the requirements of the NFIP. However, the ordinance from which this chapter is derived does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does the ordinance from which this chapter is derived repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the most stringent restrictions shall prevail.

ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES 

Sec. 62-236. - Purpose. 
    The intent and purpose of this article is to recognize the fact that certain structures or uses were established prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived that would not be permitted by this chapter. This section defines these and sets up regulations as to how these particular situations may be continued, altered, or expanded. The continued existence of certain nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the city's comprehensive plan and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is often desirable. Other nonconformities may continue to exist and afford adaptive reuse opportunities that can contribute to neighborhood character, diversity, and services. 
(Code 1977, § 17.36.010; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-237. - Continuation. 
(a)  Nonconforming use. Any lawfully established use of a building, structure, or land in existence at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or of amendments thereto, that does not conform to the use regulations for the district in which it is located shall be deemed to be a nonconforming use and may be continued except as provided herein. 
(b)  Nonconforming structure. Any lawfully established building or other structure in existence at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or amendments thereto, that does not conform to the height, bulk, area, setback, or other regulations for the district in which it is located shall be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and may continue to be used or occupied, except as otherwise provided herein. 
(c)  Nonconforming projects. Any building or structure for which a permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or of amendments thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans provided construction is started within six months and diligently pursued to completion. Such building, structure, or use shall, thereafter, be a nonconforming use and/or structure may be continued except as otherwise provided herein. 
(d)  Nonconforming signs. Subject to the limitations and termination provisions hereinafter set forth, any lawful existing nonconforming sign may be continued so long as it otherwise remains lawful after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. No nonconforming sign shall be: 
(1)  Changed or altered in any manner which would increase the degree of its nonconformity; 
(2)  Expanded; 
(3)  Changed or altered to prolong its useful life; 
(4)  Moved in whole or in part to any other location where it would remain nonconforming. 
(e)  Exceptions. The following exceptions to the regulations of this section are established: Where joint driveways and joint garages were in existence prior to July 15, 1963, it shall be permissible to repair, reconstruct or enlarge joint garages and it is not necessary to conform to the provisions governing internal lot lines. 
(Code 1977, § 17.36.020; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-238. - Discontinuation. 
(a)  Abandonment of buildings. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building, structure, or part thereof has been discontinued for a period of nine consecutive months or whenever there is evident a clear intent on the part of an owner to abandon a nonconforming use, such use, after being so discontinued or abandoned, shall not be re-established except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(b)  Abandonment of land. Whenever a nonconforming use of land has been discontinued for a period of nine months it shall be considered as an abandoned use and shall not be re-established except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which the land is located. 
(c)  Abandonment of signs. Whenever a nonconforming sign has been discontinued for a period of nine months, regardless of intent to resume or not to abandon such use, shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall not thereafter be re-established. Any period of such discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes, material shortages, or forces of nature, and without any contributing fault by the nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of this section. 
(Code 1977, § 17.36.030; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-239. - Change. 
(a)  Change to same or less restricted use. A nonconforming use of any building, structure, or part thereof may be changed to a use of the same or of a more restricted character but may not be changed to any less restricted use. 
(b)  Reversion to a nonconforming use. Whenever any part of a building, structure, or land occupied by a nonconforming use is changed to, or replaced by, a conforming use, such premises shall not thereafter be used or occupied by any nonconforming use, unless a certificate of nonconformity is obtained in accordance with section 62-244. 
(Code 1977, § 17.36.040; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-240. - Termination and removal.

If a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use or if a nonconforming structure or any nonconforming sign, billboard, or other outdoor advertising structure is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of 50 percent or more of its replacement value at the time, the building or structure may be rebuilt or used thereafter only for a conforming use and only in compliance with all other requirements for the district in which it is located. 
(b)  Repair permitted. If a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use or if a nonconforming structure is damaged by any means to an extent less than 50 percent of its replacement value at that time, it may be repaired and the previous use may be continued. However, no parking, yard, space, or bulk nonconformity shall be created or increased. 
(c)  Prompt repair required. Repair of a damaged building or other structure as permitted in subsection (b) of this section, must be started within a period of one year from the occurrence of the damage and diligently prosecuted to completion. 
(Code 1977, § 17.36.060; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-242. - Additions or enlargement.

ARTICLE IX. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 62-267. - Purpose. 
    The intent and purpose of this article is to require a specified number of adequately sized and located off-street parking and loading spaces for new and/or expanded buildings or uses to prevent congestion and hazards in the public streets. 
(Code 1977, § 17.40.010; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-268. - General provisions for parking and loading. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Floor area , in the case of office, merchandising, or service types of use, means the gross floor area of a building or structure used or intended to be used for service to the public as customer, patrons, clients, patients, or tenants including areas occupied by fixtures and equipment used for display or sale of merchandise. The term "floor area," for the purpose of this section, shall not include any area used for: 
(1)  Storage accessory to the principal use of a building; 
(2)  Incidental repairs; 
(3)  Show windows or offices incidental to the management or maintenance of a store or building; 
(4)  Restrooms; 
(5)  Utilities; 
(6)  Dressing, fitting, or alteration rooms. 
    Ground area means that area of a building site or lot actually occupied by all buildings or structures on the site except for the following: 
(1)  Parking garages; 
(2)  Carports; 
(3)  Covered or enclosed parking or loading areas; 
(4)  Parking structures. 
(b)  Procedure for application. An application for a building permit for a new or enlarged building, structure, or use shall include a plat plan, drawn to accurate dimensions and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(c)  Parking and loading facilities required. 
(1)  All buildings and structures erected or enlarged and uses of land initiated after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall provide accessory off-street parking or loading facilities as required. Parking or loading facilities shall be required for a building or structure for which a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived if construction is begun thereon within six months of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and diligently pursued to completion. 
(2)  A specific number of parking and loading facilities shall not be required for the remodeling, rehabilitations, or putting to use of an existing building or structure provided that the ground area covered by the existing building or structure shall not be increased; any existing parking and/or loading facilities shall be continued and maintained; and any area of the lot suitable for the development of approved off-street parking facilities shall be so developed. Remodeling, rehabilitation, or a use which does increase the ground area covered by such existing structure shall be subject to the same requirements as new construction. 
(d)  Decrease in parking and loading facilities permitted. When a building or structure erected or enlarged prior to or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall undergo a decrease in number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees, or other unit of measurement specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities; and further, when the decrease would result in requirement for fewer total parking or loading spaces through application of the provisions of this chapter thereto, parking and loading facilities may be reduced accordingly provided that existing parking or loading facilities shall be so decreased only when the facilities remaining would at least equal or exceed the parking or loading requirements resulting from application of the provisions of this chapter to the entire building or structure as modified. 
(e)  Increase in parking and loading facilities required. When the ground area covered by an existing building or structure shall be increased; and further, when the increase would result in a requirement for additional total parking or loading spaces through application of the provisions of this chapter thereto, parking and loading facilities shall be increased accordingly, provided that existing parking or loading facilities shall be so increased that the total facilities would at least equal or exceed the parking or loading requirements resulting from application of the provisions of this chapter to the entire building or structure as modified. 
(f)  Excess parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this section shall prevent the establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings or to prevent the establishment of facilities in excess of those required. 
(g)  Damage or destruction. Any building, structure, or use which is in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and which subsequently shall be damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause may be reconstructed, re-established, or repaired if the parking and loading facilities meet or exceed the requirements established in this section. However, it shall not be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new construction. 
(Code 1977, § 17.40.020; Ord. No. 06-04, 2006) 
Sec. 62-269. - Additional provisions for parking. 
(a)  Joint parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different buildings, structures, or uses, or for mixed uses may be provided collectively in any zoning district, and in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, in which separate parking facilities for each constituent use would be permitted provided that the total number of spaces so located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements for each use. The number of off-street parking spaces could be reduced by 15 percent per property if shared parking lots are used. The reduction would only be applied if the peak hours of operation for each use do not overlap. 
(b)  Control and location of off-site facilities. All off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same lot or on a lot adjacent to or across a public street or alley from the building, structure, or use which they are required to serve. When such facilities are provided elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal use served is located, they shall be in the same possession, either by deed or long-term lease, as the property occupied by such principal use. The required number of parking spaces must be maintained during the existence of the principal use. Off-street parking spaces may be located on surface lots, underground, under a building, or in parking structures. 
(c)  Design and maintenance. Standards for the design and maintenance of off-street parking facilities shall be as follows: 
(1)  Parking space description. A required off-street parking space shall be an area of not less than ten feet in width by 19 feet in length exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns, or office and work areas; accessible from streets or alleys or from private driveways or aisles leading to streets or alleys; and to be used for the storage or parking of passenger automobiles or commercial vehicles under 11/2-ton capacity. All parallel parking spaces shall have a stall length of not less than 20 feet and a stall width of not less than ten feet. Each space shall have a vertical clearance of not less than seven feet.

(2)  Accessible parking space description. A required off-street parking space shall be an area of not less than 16 feet in width by 19 feet in length. Each accessible parking space shall be located in close proximity to the most accessible entrance to the principal building. 
(3)  Calculation of space. When determination of the number of required off-street parking spaces results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fraction over one-half shall be interpreted as one parking space. 
(4)  Access. Parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in such a manner as will least interfere with the movement of traffic. No driveway or curb cut in any district shall exceed 30 feet in width. 
(5)  Signs. Signs may be displayed in any nonresidential district if they are not larger than two feet by two feet and located not more than ten feet from any driveway or alley which leads to the parking area. No signs shall be displayed in any parking area within any residential district except such as may be necessary for the orderly use of the parking facilities. 
(6)  Required setbacks. No off-street parking lot or area, other than a residential driveway, established on the same lot with a building shall be located within a required front yard. No parking lot or area nor portion thereof, established on a lot without a building, shall be located closer to any street line than the established building line on adjacent properties nor closer than the front yard setback required for the district in which the parking lot is located. 
(7)  Surfacing and striping. All open off-street parking areas and driveways, except those accessory to single-family dwellings, shall be improved by constructing with either: 
a.  Six inches of compacted gravel base surfaced with two inches of asphaltic concrete; or 
b.  Six inches of concrete laid over a firm base; 
c.  Striping of the surface to define the parking space shall be provided and visible at all times. 
(8)  Screening. Within any district, a five-foot landscaped divider strip shall be placed between all parking areas and sidewalks. Within or adjacent to a residential district, all open off-street parking areas for six or more cars shall be effectively screened by a wall, a solid fence, or a densely planted compact hedge along any side which is adjacent to property in residential use unless that use is across a public street or alley from such parking area. The screening shall be at least ten feet from any driveway opening and shall not interfere with the visibility of vehicles or pedestrians. 
(9)  Landscaping. In addition to the perimeter screening, within any lot containing at least 25 parking spaces, one ornamental or evergreen tree and four shrubs shall be planted for every 100 square feet of all parking spaces to be located on an interior strip of private property at a width of at least ten feet. At least five percent of the interior parking lot shall be landscaped. Trees shall be evenly spaces whenever possible. 
(10)  Lighting. The level of illumination at any point in the parking lot shall not be less than one footcandle or more than three footcandles measured at the pavement. Any lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking area shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining property. 
(11)  Drainage. Proper drainage and grading shall be provided to dispose of all runoff water. For any parking area in excess of five parking spaces, all runoff water shall be disposed of in an approved stormwater sewer or other maintenance system.

Sec. 62-325. - Purpose. 
    When a property owner or his agent shows that a strict application of the terms of this chapter relating to the use, construction, or alteration of buildings or structures or the use of land imposes upon him practical difficulties or particular hardship in that a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter, then the property owner or agent may apply for a variance.
