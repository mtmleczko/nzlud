PREFACE 
    The Revised Ordinances constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Medford, Massachusetts. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Revised Ordinances were the 1974 Revised Ordinances, as supplemented through March 18, 1975, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Revised Ordinances. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of the Revised Ordinances, the reader can locate any section of the Revised Ordinances, 1974, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Revised Ordinances, 1974, have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Revised Ordinances, 1974, together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Revised Ordinances, 1974, is included at the back of this Revised Ordinances, 1974. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in the Revised Ordinances is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Revised Ordinances is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Revised Ordinances, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Revised Ordinances, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of Revised Ordinances, which may or may not appear in these Revised Ordinances at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Robert J. Blumsack, City Solicitor, Mark E. Rumley, Assistent Solicitor, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk, and the City Council Subcommittee on Ordinances for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

ARTICLE III. - UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE ACCOUNTABILITY 

Sec. 26-41. - Definitions,

Sec. 20-42. - Purpose. 
    Many students live within the campuses of their respective universities and colleges. These students receive the benefit of their school's security or campus police services in addition to the city's police services. Because the schools know where their on-campus students live, the schools are better positioned to provide the security and regulation enforcement services necessary to protect students and property in these on-campus regions. 
    Many students, however, live outside the campuses of their respective universities and colleges. When schools do not know where their off-campus students live, it is more difficult to assess and satisfy off-campus security and regulatory enforcement needs. Therefore, it is essential for schools within the city to collect and maintain records of the locally residing off-campus student population to belter assist the city in its provision of security and regulatory enforcement services for residents of the city.

(b)  Each and every school shall collect the required directory information no less than twice each calendar year such that any school on a semester system shall collect and update the required directory information no later than 30 calendar days following the first day of each semester, and any school on a quarterly system shall collect and update the required directory information no later than 30 calendar days following the first day of the first quarter of each academic year, and every alternating quarter of the academic year thereafter. 
(c)  Upon collection, all information collected for the directory shall be organized and maintained by the school in such a way that the required information is easily accessible and understandable to any authorized school official. 
(d)  All schools shall be responsible for publicizing to their students the limitations of the city's zoning ordinance which limits occupancy to not more than three unrelated individuals. 
(Ord. No. 818, 2-28-2017) 
Sec. 26-44. - Report and statistics supplied to the city.

c.  Other private housing; and 
(5)  A complete list of the addresses of all properties currently owned, leased, rented, or operated by the school at which students are housed. 
(b)  Each and every school shall forward with 45 calendar days of the beginning of each semester or quarter that information is gathered the report required by this section to the clerk of the city and the clerk shall forward the report to the mayor of the city and the code enforcement officer. The clerk also shall docket the report and include the docket on the agenda of the next occurring meeting of the city council. The failure or refusal of a school to forward the report shall be deemed an event of non-compliance with the provisions of these sections. 
(Ord. No. 818, 2-28-2017) 
Sec. 26-45. - Violations.

(Ord. No. 498, § 1.1, 5-20-1986) 
Sec. 46-32. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the city engineer's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or VO zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Breakaway walls means any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which are not part of the structural support of the building and which are so designed as to break away, under normal high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study means the official report provided in which the Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the flood hazard boundary-floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Habitable floor means any floor usable for living purposes, which includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used only for storage purposes is not a habitable floor. 
    New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article was derived. 
    Start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure without a basement or poured footings, the start of construction includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above the ground. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article.

(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford relief. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in section 46-77(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(5)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

    No municipal street, sidewalk, public or private right-of-way, or public easement shall be opened, cut, excavated, bored, tunneled under, drilled, or trenched without a street opening permit issued by the department of public works. No municipal street restored or rebuilt within the past five years shall be cut, except in an emergency, or as approved by the commissioner of the department of public works. The permit applicant shall be the person, entity, company, utility, or agency assuming responsibility for compliance with the SPOF Program, including compliance with all requirements set out or referenced here. Where such work involves a grant of location for telecommunications or electric services, or approval required by the city council and the superintendent of wires for location of other utility structures or facilities, the permit applicant shall be required also to obtain approvals from the superintendent of wires before a street opening permit will be effective. Further, the permit applicant shall obtain all necessary permits, including but not limited to those required from the electrical department, water department, police department, and fire department before a street opening permit will be effective. Finally, the permit applicant shall obtain a "Dig Safe" number and shall arrange for disconnection of hazardous utilities prior to any work in or under a municipal street or sidewalk or public right-of-way. 
(1)  In the event of an emergency requiring immediate work in or under any municipal street, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or public easement, the permit applicant shall notify the department of public works or his or her designee as soon as practical. In no event later than the next business day after the emergency work commences, the permit applicant shall file for a street opening permit and all other permits required by city departments. 
(2)  No permit applicant or contractor will be permitted to work in or under any municipal streets, sidewalks, public rights-of-way, or public easements unless the commissioner determines that the permit applicant or contractor has demonstrated competence and experience to restore any and all municipal streets, sidewalks, public rights-of-way, and public easements in accordance with the Medford Department of Public Works standards and Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy Standards (to be employed by public utility operators when restoring streets, lanes, and highways), DTE 98-22 (August 1999), as amended and revised from time to time. Where the department of public works determines that its standards are more substantive or specific, the department of public works standards shall govern. 
(3)  The commissioner shall condition grant of a street opening permit on posting of a performance bond, provided that the commissioner shall have discretion to waive or modify the performance bond. 
(4)  At all times during the course of work in or under any municipal street, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or public easement, the permit holder shall meet all safety requirements of the department of public works, electrical department, water and sewer department, police department, and the fire department. 
(5)  Where work in or under any municipal street or sidewalk or public right-of-way or public easement is to be undertaken by more than one person, entity, company, utility, or agency, the department of public works may require the parties to designate a single permit applicant who shall be responsible for compliance with the SPOF program and who shall act as agent for all of the parties. 
(6)  The commissioner may establish a reasonable time limit for completion of work in or under as well as restoration of any and all municipal streets or sidewalks or public right-of-way or public easement. 
(7)  Administrative fees and SPOF restoration fees paid to the department of public works under the SPOF program are intended solely to reimburse the city for costs incurred for permitting and restoring openings in any and all municipal streets, sidewalks, public rights of way, and public easements. These fees are independent of fees charged by other departments and commissions.

The administrative fee shall be paid at the time of permit application. 
(2)  No work, other than emergency work under subsection 74-151(1) will be permitted prior to full payment of the administrative fee unless determined otherwise by the commissioner. 
(Ord. No. 751, 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 74-143. - Street restoration. 
    After opening and completing work in or under any municipal street, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or public easement, the permit holder shall be responsible for restoration. 
(1)  Prior to restoration of the surface of any municipal street, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or public easement, the permit holder shall certify in writing that it has completed work in the opening and has backfilled, closed, and compacted the opening to a soil density value of 95 percent modified Proctor density as specified in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standard AASHTO T180. 
(2)  In the event the department of public works streets division superintendent determines that the opening has not been backfilled, closed, and compacted to this standard, the department will charge the permit applicant for all costs required to complete backfilling, closing, and compaction to the AASHTO T180 standard. 
(3)  If the permit holder elects to participate in the SPOF restoration program and has paid the SPOF restoration fee calculated under subsection 74-154(2) the permit holder shall restore the opening and surface of the municipal street, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or public easement and maintain it in serviceable condition for 12 months. This includes restoration of surfaces impacted by all holes of any kind made with devices used for leak detection. 
(4)  If the permit holder has declined participation in the SPOF restoration program, it shall restore the opening and surface of the municipal street, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or public easement to the stricter of the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy Standards or the department of public works five-year standards referenced in subsection 74-151(2) and in accordance with a schedule approved by the commissioner. Restoration shall be subject to the performance bond requirement of subsection 74-151(3). 
(Ord. No. 751, 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 74-144. - SPOF restoration program and fees. 
    Election to participate in the SPOF restoration program must be made at the time of application for a street opening permit under section 74-141. Where participation in the SPOF restoration program has been made and where the SPOF restoration fee has been paid, the permit holder will not be obligated to maintain its restoration of a municipal street, sidewalk, public right-of-way, or public easement beyond 12 months from completion of the restoration. 
(1)  The SPOF restoration fee will defer part of the cost for permanent restoration of any and all municipal streets, sidewalks, public right-of-way, or public easement. The fee shall be paid within 30 days after grant of a street opening permit. 
(2)  The SPOF restoration fee shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  For restoration of a municipal street opening of 50 square feet or less, the SPOF fee shall be determined by multiplying the most recent City of Medford contract price for street reconstruction times the total square footage to be restored. 
b.  For restoration of a municipal street opening of more than 50 square feet with a width of four feet or less, the SPOF restoration fee shall be determined by multiplying the most recent City of Medford contract price for street reconstruction times the product of the length of the street to be restored and one-half of the paved width of the street measured from curb to curb. 
c.  For restoration of a longitudinal, municipal street opening of more than 50 square feet with a width of more than four feet, the SPOF restoration fee shall be determined by multiplying the most recent City of Medford contract price for street reconstruction times the product of the length of the street to be restored and the paved width of the street measured from curb to curb. 
d.  For restoration of a public or private right-of-way or public easement, the SPOF fee shall be determined by multiplying the most recent City of Medford contract price for street reconstruction times the total square footage to be restored. In the event, the department of public works determines that proper restoration of the right-of-way requires restoration of more than the work area, the SPOF fee shall be calculated to include the entire area to be restored. 
e.  For restoration of a municipal sidewalk, the SPOF restoration fee shall be determined by multiplying the most recent City of Medford contract price for sidewalk reconstruction for the specific material required times the total square footage to be restored.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 82-93. - Authority of division's provisions; responsibility of water purveyor. 
    As provided in the Federal Drinking Water Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-523) and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Drinking Water Regulations 310 CMR 22.22, the water purveyor has the primary responsibility for preventing water from unapproved sources or any other substances from entering the public potable water system. 
(Ord. No. 568A, § 2.2, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 82-94. - Responsibility for protection of potable water supply; installation of backflow prevention devices. 
    The director of public works, or his designee, shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow or backsiphonage of contaminants or pollutants. If, as a result of a survey of the premises, the director of public works, or his designee, determines that an approved backflow prevention device is required at the city's water service connection or as inplant protection on any customer's premises, the director of public works, or his delegated representative, shall issue a cross connection violation form to the customer to install approved backflow prevention devices. The customer shall, within a time frame determined by the director of public works, install such approved device or devices at his own expense, and failure or refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install such devices within the specified time frame shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such devices have been properly installed. 
(Ord. No. 568A, § 2.3, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 82-95. - Administration of division. 
(a)  The cross connection control coordinator will oversee an active cross connection control program. This program will include the keeping of necessary records, which fulfills the requirements of the state DEQE's cross connection regulations and is approved by the department. 
(b)  The owner shall allow his property to be inspected for possible cross connections and shall follow the provisions of the program and the department's regulations. 
(Ord. No. 568A, § 2.5.2, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 82-96. - Requirements. 
(a)  Director of public works. The director of public works shall be responsible for the following: 
(1)  On new installations, the cross connection control coordinator or his designee will provide onsite evaluations and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of backflow preventer, if any, that will be required, and notify the owner of plan approval requirements by the appropriate reviewing authority. 
(2)  For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the cross connection control coordinator or his designee will perform surveys of the premises and reviews of as-built plans and issue a cross connection violation form to the owner detailing any corrective action required, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made. The time period allowed shall depend upon the degree of hazard involved. 
(3)  The cross connection control coordinator will not allow any cross connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which a permit has been issued and which will be regularly tested to ensure satisfactory operation. 
(4)  If the cross connection control coordinator determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately. 
(5)  The cross connection control coordinator or his designee will begin initial premises inspections to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards, following the approval of this program by this department, during the calendar year of 1991. Initial focus will be on high-hazard industries and commercial premises. 
(6)  The cross connection control coordinator strongly recommends that all new and retrofit installations of reduced pressure preventers and double check valve assemblies include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device. The installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs, water main breaks, fires, periodic cleaning and flushing of mains, etc. These occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers. 
(b)  Owner. The owner shall be responsible for the following: 
(1)  The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross connections on his premises. 
(2)  The owner shall be responsible for applying for and obtaining all necessary approvals and permits for the maintenance of cross connections and installation of backflow prevention devices, and applying annually for the renewal of each permit. 
(3)  The owner shall have any device that fails an inspection or test repaired by a licensed plumber. 
(4)  The owners shall inform the director of public works of any proposed or modified cross connection and also any existing cross connection of which the owner is aware but has not been found by the director of public works or his designated agent. 
(5)  The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the devices must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place. 
(6)  The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by the department and by the director of public works or his designee. 
(7)  The owner shall install only reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check valve assemblies approved by the state DEQE. 
(8)  Any owner of industrial, commercial or institutional premises having a private well or other private water source must have a permit if the well or source is cross connected to the city water system. Permission to cross connect may be denied by the director of public works or his designee. The owner may be required to install a backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained even if it is not cross connected to the city water system. 
(9)  The owner of any residential premises having a private well or other private water source will not be allowed a physical connection with the public water supply system unless approved in writing by the board of health and plumbing inspector. 
(10)  The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for permits, device testings, retestings in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and second reinspections for noncompliance with the director of public works or department requirements. 
(11)  The owner shall be responsible for providing labor on the premises as necessary to allow inspection and testing of devices by the director of public works or his designated agent. 
(12)  The owner shall be responsible for having spare parts and repair tools for the backflow devices on the premises at all times. If the backflow device is not able to be repaired the owner is responsible for supplying a replacement device. 
(Ord. No. 568A, § 2.6, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 82-97. - Degree of hazard. 
    The director of public works recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from cross connections. As such, the director of public works, whereas he is responsible for the quality of the public water supply, may require a containment device on the water service entrance to any customer who, as a result of unprotected cross connections, could contaminate the public water supply system. 
(Ord. No. 568A, § 2.7, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 82-98. - Existing in-use backflow prevention devices. 
    Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the director of public works to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure backflow preventer, or a reduced pressure backflow preventer must be installed in the event that no backflow device was present. 
(Ord. No. 568A, § 2.8, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 82-99. - Periodic testing. 
(a)  Reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check valve assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least semiannually by the director of public works or his delegated agent. 
(b)  Periodic testing shall be performed by the director of public works, certified tester or his delegated representative. 
(c)  The testing shall be conducted during the director of public works regular business hours. Exceptions to this, when at the request of the owner, may require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the director of public works or his delegated agent. 
(d)  Reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check valve assemblies must be tested annually by the owner, independent of the semiannual tests by the water supplier, and such test must be conducted by a certified tester. 
(e)  Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test must be repaired or replaced by a licensed plumber. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair, the device will be retested at the owner's expense to ensure proper operation. High-hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a date of not more than 14 days after the test date will be established. Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service remains during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity. 
(f)  Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified previously in subsection (a) of this section in cases where there is a history of test failures and the director of public works feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Costs of the additional tests will be borne by the owner. 
(Ord. No. 568A, § 2.9.6, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 82-100. - Enforcement of division. 
(a)  The director of public works shall not allow a cross connection to exist with the public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and all appropriate approvals and permits have been issued. 
(b)  After any violations of this division are found, in surveys or otherwise, the supplier must send out a cross connection violation form detailing the violations and a procedure for corrective action. This shall include a requirement for plan submittal and will include the deadline for such submittal and who the reviewing authority will be (either the department, the director of public works, or his designee). A period of 30 days will be granted for plan submittal unless a more appropriate schedule is necessary in the judgment of the director of public works. 
(c)  If the owner of any premises does not initiate corrective actions by the prescribed deadline, the director of public works will then issue a followup letter indicating that the owner remains in violation and under 310 CMR 22.22 section 2(b) of the Drinking Water Regulations of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will have his service terminated unless corrective work is initiated within 15 days. 
(d)  If the owner of any premises remains in noncompliance after the deadline established in this second letter, the property will be posted for shutoff, and the water service will be terminated. The owner will be notified of this in writing. 
(e)  If circumstances arise where a large number of violations are found and it becomes a large financial burden to the owner of the premises, then a creative enforcement strategy will be undertaken whereby corrective work is staggered over a reasonable period of time. However, the public water supply distribution mains must never be at risk, and containment devices will be a priority at any high-hazard facility. 
(f)  If the occasion should arise where termination of the water supply will result in unreasonable risk to the public health of the community, then the department will be notified and other enforcement strategies will be necessary including, but not limited to, the assessment of an administrative penalty to any owner in noncompliance with section 22 of the Drinking Water Regulations of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
(Ord. No. 568A, § 2.10.6, 8-4-1992) 
Sec. 82-101. - Records and reports. 
(a)  Records. The director of public works will initiate and maintain the following: 
(1)  Master files of customer cross connection tests and/or inspections. 
(2)  Master files on approved cross connection installations. 
(3)  Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the state department of environmental quality engineering. 
(b)  Reports. The director of public works will submit the following to the state department of environmental quality engineering: 
(1)  Initial listing of high-hazard cross connections. 
(2)  Initial listing of low-hazard cross connections. 
(3)  Annual update lists of subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. 
(4)  Annual summary of cross connection inspections and surveys.

The charges shall constitute a lien on the real estate using the sewer, and the lien shall continue for two years after such charges and committed to the water department. Demand for the payment of charges shall be made in like manner as demands for the payment of water use charges and sales for the nonpayment of charges and all proceedings connected therewith shall be made upon the same notices thereof, and shall otherwise be conducted in the same manner as sales for nonpayment of water use charges. All proceedings subsequent to such sales, relative to redemption, the purchase and holding of the land by the city, the interest to be paid in case of redemption, and otherwise, shall be the same as when the land is sold for taxes. Such charges may also be collected by an action of contract in the name of the city, brought within two years after the charges have become due and payable.

Chapter 87 - WETLANDS 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 87-1-87-30. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - WETLANDS ORDINANCE 

Sec. 87-31. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to preserve and protect the wetlands, water resources, and adjacent upland areas within the boundaries of the City of Medford by controlling activities deemed by the conservation commission likely to have a significant individual and/or cumulative effect upon resource area values, including but not limited to the following: public or private water supply, groundwater, flood control, erosion and sedimentation control, storm damage prevention, water quality, water pollution control, fisheries, wildlife habitat, rare species habitat including rare plant species, agriculture, aquaculture, aesthetics, recreation values, coastal storm flowage, and shell fisheries deemed important to the community (collectively, the "resource area values protected by this article"). This article is intended to utilize the Home Rule authority of this municipality to protect additional resource areas, for additional values, with additional standards and procedures stricter than those of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40) and Regulations thereunder (310 CMR 10.00-10.99), subject, however, to the rights and benefits accorded to agricultural uses and structures of all kinds under the laws of the Commonwealth. 
(Ord. No. 719, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 87-32. - Jurisdiction. 
    Except as permitted by the conservation commission or as provided in this article, no person shall commence to remove, fill, dredge, build upon, degrade, discharge into, or otherwise alter the following resource areas: any freshwater wetlands; marshes; wet meadows; bogs; swamps; vernal pools; isolated vegetated wetlands; bordering vegetated wetlands; banks; reservoirs; lakes; ponds of any size; rivers; streams; creeks; beaches; lands under water bodies; lands subject to flooding or inundation by groundwater or surface water; coastal wetlands; estuaries; salt marshes; and lands subject to tidal action, coastal storm flowage, or coastal flooding (collectively the "wetland resource areas protected by this article"), and certain adjacent upland areas (collectively the "adjacent upland resource areas protected by this article") as described in section 87-40. Said resource areas shall be protected whether or not they border surface waters. 
(Ord. No. 719, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 87-33. - Exemptions and exceptions. 
    The application and permit required by this article shall not be required for work performed for normal maintenance or improvement of land in agricultural use as defined by the Wetlands Protection Act Regulations at 310 CMR 10.04. 
    The application and permit required by this article shall not be required for maintaining, repairing, or replacing, but not substantially changing or enlarging, an existing and lawfully located structure or facility used in the service of the public to provide electric, gas, water, sewer, drainage, telephone, telegraph, or other telecommunication services, provided that written notice has been given to the conservation commission prior to commencement of work, and provided that the work conforms to any performance standards and design specifications in regulations adopted by the commission. 
    The application and permit required by this article shall not be required for emergency projects necessary for the protection of the health and safety of the public, provided that the work is to be performed by or has been ordered to be performed by an agency of the Commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof; provided that advance notice, oral or written, has been given to the commission prior to commencement of work or within 24 hours after commencement; provided that the commission or its agent certifies the work as an emergency project; provided that the work is performed only for the time and place certified by the commission for the limited purposes necessary to abate the emergency; and provided that within 21 days of commencement of an emergency project a permit application shall be filed with the commission for review as provided by this article. Upon failure to meet these and other requirements of the commission, the commission may, after notice and a public hearing, revoke or modify an emergency project approval and order restoration and mitigation measures. 
    The conversion of lawn to uses accessory to existing single-family houses in existence prior to August 7, 1996, such as decks, sheds, and patios, are grandfathered and/or exempted from the permit requirements in this article provided the activity is located more than 50 feet from the mean annual high-water line from a river or from a vegetated wetland, whichever is farther, and erosion and sedimentation controls are implemented during construction. The conversion of such uses accessory to existing single-family houses to lawn is also allowed. (Mowing of lawns in existence prior to the effective date of this article is not subject to jurisdiction under this article). 
    Other than stated in this section, the exceptions provided in the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00-10.99) shall not apply under this article. 
(Ord. No. 719, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 87-34. - Repeal of ordinances. 
    Upon the acceptance of the foregoing ordinance by the city and the publication as required by law of such thereof as shall be approved by the city solicitor, all ordinances heretofore existing, excepting the zoning ordinances, the rules and regulations of the board of health, ordinances relating to plumbers and plumbing, and building regulations for inspection and construction of buildings, shall be annulled and repealed, provided that this repeal shall not apply to or affect any statute of the Commonwealth, and shall not revive any ordinance in force before or at the time when the ordinance repeal took effect. 
(Ord. No. 719, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 87-35. - Applications and fees. 
    Written application shall be filed with the conservation commission to perform activities affecting resource areas protected by this article. The permit application shall include such information and plans as are deemed necessary by the commission to describe proposed activities and their effects on the resource areas protected by this article. No activities shall commence without receiving and complying with a permit issued pursuant to this article. 
    The commission, in an appropriate case, may accept as the application and plans under this article any application and plans filed under the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00). 
    Any person desiring to know whether or not a proposed activity or an area is subject to this article may file a request for determination of applicability (RDA). Any person desiring a determination of the boundary of one or more wetland resource areas defined in this article may request an approval of delineation of said resource areas by filing an abbreviated notice of resource area (ANRAD). Such RDA or ANRAD shall include information and plans as are deemed necessary by the commission. Any determination of applicability or order of resource area delineation issued by the commission shall be binding for three years, except that the commission may, in any order of conditions issued for the same property within that three-year period, modify an order of resource area delineation based on newly discovered or disclosed information, mutual mistake, or other good cause. No order of resource area delineation shall be considered a final decision subject to appeal until a final order of conditions is issued. 
    At the time of an application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified in the regulations of the commission. The fee is in addition to that required by the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00-10.99). 
    Upon receipt of an application, or at any point during the hearing process, the commission is authorized to require an applicant to pay a fee for the reasonable costs and expenses borne by the commission for specific expert engineering and other consultant services deemed necessary by the commission to come to a final decision on the application. This fee is called the "consultant fee." The specific consultant services may include, but are not limited to, performing or verifying the accuracy of resource area survey and delineation; analyzing resource area functions and values, including wildlife habitat evaluations, hydrogeologic and drainage analysis; review of alternative analyses; and researching environmental or land use law. 
    Subject to the adoption of the regulation as referenced above, fees shall be deposited in a revolving account established under M.G.L.A. c. 44, § 53G for uses set out in the vote which established the fund. This account shall be kept separate from the account established for filing fees paid under the state Wetlands Protection Act. 
    The exercise of discretion by the commission in making its determination to require the payment of a consultant fee shall be based upon its reasonable finding that additional information available only through outside consultants is necessary for the making of an objective decision. Any applicant aggrieved by the imposition of, or size of, the consultant fee, or any act related thereto, may appeal according to the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws. 
    The commission may waive the filing fee, consultant fee, and costs and expenses for a permit or other application or RDA filed by a government agency. 
(Ord. No. 719, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 87-36. - Notice and hearings. 
    Any person filing a permit, ANRAD or other application or RDA with the conservation commission shall at the same time give written notice thereof, by certified mail (return receipt requested) or hand delivery, to all abutters at their mailing addresses shown on the most recent applicable tax list of the assessor, including owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within 200 feet of the property line of the applicant, including any in another municipality or across a body of water. The notice to abutters shall have enclosed a copy of the application or request, with plans, or shall state where copies may be examined and obtained by abutters. An affidavit of the person providing such notice, with a copy of the notice mailed or delivered, shall be filed with the commission. The applicant shall submit to the commission, at or before the public hearing, receipts for such notices or other satisfactory evidence that such notices have been given, and failure to provide such evidence shall be grounds for rescheduling of the hearing, or if intentional or repeated, denial of the requested permit. When a person requesting a determination is other than the owner, the request, the notice of the hearing and the determination itself shall be sent by the commission to the owner as well as to the person making the request. 
    The commission shall conduct a public hearing on any permit application, ANRAD or RDA, with written notice given at the expense of the applicant, at least five business days prior to the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. 
    The commission shall commence the public hearing within 21 days from receipt of a completed permit application, ANRAD or RDA unless an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant or requested at a public hearing. The commission shall have authority to continue the hearing to a specific date announced at the hearing, for reasons stated at the hearing, which may include the need for additional information from the applicant or others deemed necessary by the commission in its discretion, based on comments and recommendations of the boards and officials. 
    The commission shall issue its permit, other order or determination in writing within 21 days of the close of the public hearing thereon unless an extension is authorized in writing by the applicant. 
    The commission, in an appropriate case, may combine its hearing under this article with the hearing conducted under the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00). 
(Ord. No. 719, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 87-37. - Coordination with other boards. 
    At the discretion of the conservation commission, the commission's agent shall notify the mayor, community development board, board of appeals, board of health, city engineer, and building commissioner when an application or request will be heard at a public hearing. Notification shall be provided to the conservation commission of the adjoining municipality, if the application or RDA pertains to property within 200 feet of that municipality. The commission shall not take final action until the boards and officials have had 14 days from receipt of notice to file written comments and recommendations with the commission, which the commission shall take into account but which shall not be binding on the commission. The applicant shall have the right to receive any comments and recommendations, and to respond to them at a hearing of the commission, prior to final action. 
(Ord. No. 719, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 87-38. - Permits and conditions. 
    If the conservation commission, after a public hearing, determines that the activities which are subject to the permit application or the land and water uses which will result there from, are likely to have a significant individual and/or cumulative effect upon the resource area values protected by this article, the commission, within 21 days of the close of the hearing, shall issue or deny a permit for the activities requested. If it issues a permit, the commission shall impose conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to protect those values, and all activities shall be done in accordance with those conditions. The commission shall take into account the cumulative adverse effects of loss, degradation, isolation, and replication of protected resource areas throughout the community and the watershed, resulting from past activities, permitted and exempt, and foreseeable future activities. 
    Where no conditions are adequate to protect those resource values, the commission is empowered to deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements of this article. It may also deny a permit for: failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the commission; for failure to meet the design specifications, performance standards, and other requirements in regulations of the commission; or for failure to avoid or prevent unacceptable significant individual and/or cumulative effects upon the resource area values protected by this article. 
    Lands within 200 feet of rivers and lands within 100 feet of other resource areas, are presumed important to the protection of these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to resource areas have a high likelihood of adverse impact upon the wetland or other resource, either immediately, as a consequence of construction, clearing, or over time, as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities. 
    These adverse impacts from construction and use can include, without limitation, erosion, siltation, loss of groundwater recharge, poor water quality, excessive nitrogen and/or phosphorous loading and loss of wildlife habitat. The commission may therefore establish performance standards for protection of the adjacent upland resource area including without limitation strips of continuous, undisturbed vegetative cover within the adjacent upland resource area, or other form of work limit or setback to buildings, roads, landscaping and other features, unless the applicant convinces the commission that the area or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values protected by this article. The specific size and type of protected area may be established by regulations of the commission. 
    In the review of areas within 200 feet of rivers, no permit issued hereunder shall allow any activities unless the applicant, in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this article, has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects, and that (2) such activities, including proposed mitigation measures, will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or values protected by this article. The commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use, overall project purpose (e.g., residential, institutional, commercial, or industrial purpose), logistics, existing technology, costs of the alternatives, and overall project costs. 
    To prevent wetlands loss, the commission shall require applicants to avoid wetlands alteration wherever feasible; shall minimize wetlands alteration; and, where alteration is unavoidable, shall require full mitigation. The commission may authorize or require replication of wetlands as a form of mitigation, but only with adequate security, professional design, and monitoring to assure success, because of the high likelihood of failure of replication. 
    The commission may require a wildlife habitat study of the project area, to be paid for by the applicant, whenever it deems appropriate, regardless of the type of resource area or the amount or type of alteration proposed. The decision shall be based upon the commission's estimation of the importance of the habitat area considering (but not limited to) such factors as proximity to other areas suitable for wildlife, importance of "wildlife corridors" in the area, or possible presence of rare species in the area. The work shall be performed by an individual who is approved by the conservation commission and at a minimum meets the qualifications set out in the wildlife habitat section of the Wetlands Protection Act Regulations (310 CMR 10.60). 
    The commission shall presume that all areas meeting the criteria of "vernal pools" of this article as defined in the definitions, including its adjacent upland resource area, perform essential habitat functions. This presumption may be overcome only by the presentation of credible evidence, which, in the judgment of the commission, demonstrates that the basin or depression does not provide essential habitat functions. Any formal evaluation should be performed by an individual meeting the qualifications under the wildlife habitat section of the Wetlands Protection Act Regulations (310 CMR 10.60). 
    A permit shall expire three years from the date of issuance. The commission reserves the right to require a conservation restriction on any property or portion thereof that the commission deems appropriate to the interests protected under the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40) and this article. 
    In carrying out its duties under this article, the commission shall take into account the ongoing damage to and impairment of property values resulting from the enclosure of natural watercourses in pipes and culverts that has already occurred in various locations throughout the city, the loss of flood storage area associated with those projects, and the extent to which increased urbanization has increased flows to the city's existing stormwater infrastructure. The commission may require replication of flood storage capacity on a greater than one-to-one basis, reduction of peak flows, or other mitigation where feasible. 
    Notwithstanding the above, the commission in its discretion, may issue a permit expiring five years from the date of issuance for recurring or continuous maintenance and/or restoration work, provided that annual notification of time and location of work is given to the commission. Any permit may be renewed once for an additional one-year period, provided that a request for a renewal is received in writing by the commission 30 days prior to expiration. 
    Notwithstanding the above, a permit may identify conditions which shall be enforceable for a stated number of years, indefinitely, or until permanent protection is in place, and shall apply to all owners of the land. 
    For good cause the commission may revoke any permit, other order, determination or other decision issued under this article after notice to the holder of the permit, the public, abutters, and city boards, and a public hearing. Amendments to permits or determinations shall be handled in the manner set out in the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40) and this article. 
    The commission in an appropriate case may combine the decision issued under this article with the order of conditions, order of resource area delineation (ORAD), determination of applicability or certificate of compliance issued under the Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40) and Regulations (310 CMR 10.00-10.99). 
    No work proposed in any application shall be undertaken until the permit, ORAD, or determination issued by the commission with respect to such work has been recorded in the registry of deeds or, if the land affected is registered land, in the registry section of the land court for the district wherein the land lies, and until the holder of the permit certifies in writing to the commission that the document has been recorded. If the applicant fails to perform, the commission may record the documents itself. 
    If, at any time after a determination of applicability or order of conditions has been issued, there is a change in the proposed activity, the person on whose behalf the work is being done, in the case of a determination, or the applicant, in the case of an order, must notify the commission, in writing or in person, of the proposed changes. No work associated with these changes shall be done on the subject area until the commission has reviewed the changes and issued its decision. 
    The commission shall review these changes and determine either: 
(1)  That the changes represent a substantial departure from the original proposal and that the potential impacts of the new proposal on the interests identified in this article are sufficiently different from those of the original proposal as to require the filing of a new request for determination or notice of intent; 
(2)  That the changes involve a substantial departure from the original proposal in only one or two limited respects, and that the commission will consider amending the original determination or order following submission of information on the proposed changes and their potential impacts on the interests identified in this article and following a public meeting or hearing and notice as required in this article; or 
(3)  That the changes represent an insignificant change in the original proposal and will cause no significant difference in the impact of the activity on the interests identified in this article, in which case the person proposing these changes may proceed in conformance with them. 
    The person making this request shall be notified by the commission of its decision within 21 days of receipt of his request. 
    The commission shall, after receiving a written request for a certificate of compliance, inspect the resource area where any activity governed by a permit issued under this article was carried out and if such activity has been completed in accordance with said permit, the commission shall within 21 days after such request, issue a certificate of compliance evidencing such determination, which may in an appropriate case be combined with a certificate of compliance issued under the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L.A. c. 131, § 40). A certificate of compliance may specify conditions in the permit, which will continue to apply. 
(Ord. No. 719, 5-3-2005) 
Sec. 87-39. - Regulations.

Sec. 94-141. - General provisions. 
(a)  In any district, no building, structure or land shall hereafter be used, occupied, or changed to a use that does not conform to the use regulations for that district, nor shall any use be enlarged or extended, except as herein provided, and as provided in M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 6. 
(b)  In any district, no building or structure shall hereafter be moved, erected, constructed, reconstructed, extended, structurally changed or enlarged except in conformance with all the regulations in this chapter, nor shall any building or structure be altered for a change in use or an enlargement or extension of use, except as herein provided. 
(c)  In any district, no lot devoted to a use shall hereafter be changed in size or shape so that any existing nonconformance with the regulations of this chapter is increased or any violation created, except as herein provided, and as provided in M.G.L.A. c. 40A.

(Rev. Ords. 1974, ch. 29, §§ 4.1-4.6; Ord. No. 701, § 17, 6-3-2003) 
Sec. 94-142. - Buffer provisions. 
    Due to the higher density and mix of commercial, retail and residential uses in the MUZ district, the requirements of this section 94-142 shall not apply to the MUZ district. 
(a)  Height. Except as provided hereinafter there shall be placed and maintained a buffer strip to a height: 
(1)  Not less than six feet above the finished surface of the side or rear lot line, in any district along any side or rear line within the side or rear yard of a lot: 
a.  Which is occupied by an institutional use; or a principal use allowed in a commercial or industrial district, but not allowed in a residential district; and 
b.  Where said side or rear lot line is in common with a lot in residential use in a residential district. 
(2)  Not less than three and one-half feet above the surface of a parking area, in any district between the edge of any parking area and the adjacent lot or street line except at entrance and exit drives: 
a.  Where the parking area contains more than four spaces; and 
b.  Where said lot or street line is in common with or opposite a lot in a residential district. 
(b)  Additional requirements. 
(1)  Where the provisions of subsection 94-142(a)(1) subsection 94-142(a)(2) conflict, requirements of subsection 94-142(a)(1) shall be applied. 
(2)  Where the surface of the abutting street or lot adjacent to the street or lot line is elevated at least the required height of buffer strip above the finished surface of the side or rear line of the lot to which subsection 94-142(a)(1) applies, or the surface of the parking area to which subsection 94-142(a)(2) applies, no landscaped area, wall or fence shall be required. 
(3)  Where a lot subject to the requirements of subsection 94-142(a) is to be occupied by a use the permit for which is subject to the procedures specified in section 94-81, the permit granting authority may specify substitute materials for the buffer strip, and may change its extent and specify minimum and minimum dimensions; increasing the requirement in accordance with the characteristics of the proposed use and its relationship to adjoining streets, and uses, and to the neighborhood, but not decreasing or eliminating the requirement. 
(c)  Screening and buffers between residential and nonresidential uses. On any lot with a nonresidential use, where such a lot adjoins a lot with a residential use, screening and buffers shall apply as follows: A buffer strip shall be at least 15 feet in width and shall contain a screen of plantings of vertical habit located at the border of the lot with the nonresidential use and shall be not less than three feet in width and six feet in height at the time of occupancy of such lot or as early as deemed possible by the building commissioner. Individual shrubs shall be planted not more than 15 feet on center, and shall thereafter be maintained by the owner or occupants so as to maintain a dense screen year round. A permanent irrigation system may be required for such landscaped areas, as required and approved by the building commissioner. At least 50 percent of the plantings shall be evenly spaced. A fence, other than a chain link fence not to exceed six feet in height complemented by suitable plantings and located at the border of the lot with the nonresidential use, may be substituted for such landscaped buffer strip if and as approved by the director of the office of community development. A solid wall may be required to mitigate incompatible land uses, noise, visual and/or other impacts, as required by the director of the office of community development or building commissioner. 
These provisions shall also apply for any lot with a nonresidential use that includes open storage and borders a public way. In such cases, a buffer strip or screen which complies with the above provisions, shall be located at a minimum where the lot borders the public way. Upon the determination of the director of the office of community development, the buffer strip or screen may be required to be extended to other areas to protect the character of adjacent property, views, or significant structures whether such adjacent use is residential or not, from the use of property for open storage. 
(Rev. Ords. 1974, ch. 29, §§ 4.7, 4.8; Ord. No. 561, 3-5-1991; Ord. No. 701, § 15, 6-3-2003) 
Sec. 94-143. - Visibility requirements.

Sec. 94-171. - General dimensional requirements. 
(a)  Generally. Dimensional requirements shall be as specified in the "Table of Dimensional Requirements," subsection 94-171(c), and are a part of this chapter. The letter "H" denotes the height of the building. The letter "L" denotes the horizontal dimension of the side of the building substantially parallel to the lot line or street line that bounds the yard in question. The letters "N/A" in this table denote types of structures to which particular dimensional requirements are not applicable. In addition to the requirement of subsection 94-171(c), all structures shall be subject to the supplementary dimensional requirements of subsection 94-171(b) below. 
(b)  Supplementary dimensional requirements. 
(1)  Minimum gross floor area. Each dwelling unit in a two-family dwelling structure shall contain not less than 768 square feet gross floor area. 
(2)  Maximum setback. No part of any building shall be located more than 300 feet from a street in a residential district, or more than 265 feet from a street in any other district unless all such parts of said building are within the same distance from an operative fire hydrant connected to the public water supply and approved as to clearance and location by the chief of the city fire department. 
(3)  Courts. In any district, inner courts and outer courts shall be permitted only in accordance with the following dimensional requirements: 
a.  Inner courts shall have a width of at least 30 feet but not less than the height, and shall have a length of not less than twice nor more than four times the width. 
b.  Outer courts shall have a width of at least 30 feet but not less than the height. Such a court with one end open shall not have a length more than the width, and with two ends open a length more than three times the width. 
(4)  Minimum distance between structures. In any district, the minimum distance between any point of any structures on the same lot shall be as follows: 
a.  Principal structures shall not be less than the same distance from one another as if they were on separate lots. 
b.  Buildings accessory to single or two-family detached dwellings shall not be less than ten feet from that detached dwelling unless part of and attached to that dwelling, nor less than ten feet from another accessory building. 
c.  Buildings accessory to dwelling structures other than single- or two-family detached dwellings shall not be less than 15 feet from that dwelling structure, nor less than ten feet from another accessory building. 
d.  Buildings accessory to other permitted principal structures shall not be less than the same distance from that principal structure and from any other accessory building as if they were on separate lots.

Sec. 94-172. - Rules for application of dimensional requirements: Special cases. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this section is to provide rules for application of dimensional requirements in special cases, to define special applications of dimensional requirements that may be applied and to further clarify the application of the dimensional requirements within the intent of this chapter. 
(b)  General application of yard requirements. 
(1)  Parking spaces not enclosed in a structure but required for any use may be provided in any required yard subject to the provisions of section 94-191. 
(2)  Loading spaces not enclosed in a structure but required for any use may be provided in a side yard of a commercial or industrial district or rear yard of any district subject to the provisions of section 94-191. 
(c)  Application of front yard requirements. 
(1)  Where, within a distance of 150 feet on each side of a lot on the same side of the same street, front yards of two or more existing buildings have been established to a greater or lesser depth than the required front yard depth, then the average depth of such yards of such existing buildings within such distance shall be the required front yard depth for that lot. 
(2)  Front yard requirements shall not apply to terraces, steps, uncovered porches, or other similar features at or below the elevation of the floor of the first story, nor to fences, hedges, or walls less than four feet above the grade in the required front yard. 
(3)  Balconies, and uncovered porches not over half the length of the front building wall, may project into a required front yard but not more than one-third of its width. Belt courses, fins, columns, leaders, sills, pilasters, lintels and ornamental features may project not more than one foot, and cornices and gutters not more than two feet, over a required front yard. In no case shall any such projection come within eight feet of any front lot line. 
(d)  Application of side yard requirements. 
(1)  Where a side lot line in a commercial district abuts a residential district, the side yard requirements of that residential district shall apply to the abutting yard in the commercial district. 
(2)  On a corner lot, the side yard adjacent to a street shall be at least that distance required for front yards. 
(3)  Where a side yard which is required to be in excess of 15 feet is adjacent to a park, reservation or other permanent public open space, then all but 15 feet of the required yard may be measured from the center of said open space. 
(4)  Bays, balconies, chimneys, flues, and fire escapes, and uncovered porches not over the length of the side building wall may project into a required side yard but not more than one-third of its width. Belt courses, fins, columns, leaders, sills, pilasters, lintels and ornamental features may project not more than one foot, and cornices and gutters not more than two feet, over a required side yard. In no case shall any such projection come within four feet of any side lot line. 
(5)  Side yard requirements shall not apply to terraces, steps or other similar features at or below the elevation of the floor of the first story, nor to fences, hedges, or walls less than four feet above the grade in the required yard within 15 feet of a street line, and not over six feet above the grade in the required yard in all other cases. 
(e)  Application of rear yard requirements. 
(1)  No structure shall be built within the rear yard except for a structure accessory to a one or two-family dwelling which may occupy up to 25 percent of the rear yard area. 
(2)  Where a rear yard which is required to be in excess of 15 feet is adjacent to a park, reservation or other permanent public open space, then all but 15 feet of the required yard may be measured from the center of said open space. 
(3)  Such projections as are permitted by subsection 94-172(d) into side yards are also permitted into rear yards to the same extent. 
(f)  Application of height requirements. 
(1)  The height restriction will be determined in accordance with the definition in section 94-2. 
(2)  Church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers, flag poles, windmills, chimneys, smoke-stacks, silos, derricks, conveyors, masts, aerials, water tanks or other structures normally built above the roof and not devoted to human occupancy may be built to a height not greater than 150 percent of the height of the principal structure. Such structures, however, shall be erected only to such heights as are necessary to accomplish the purpose they are normally intended to serve. 
(3)  No structure within 100 feet of the boundary of an SF-1, SF-2, GR or APT-1 district shall exceed four stories, or 50 feet, in height. 
(g)  Application of minimum open space requirements. 
(1)  Landscaped open space and usable open space may be included within the front, side, and rear yards, but shall be exclusive of parking and loading areas and access drives. 
(2)  Landscaped open space and usable open space shall be mutually exclusive. 
(3)  The requirement for minimum usable open space shall not apply to nonresidential structures, nor to hotels, or other residential structures intended and designed primarily for transient occupancy. 
(h)  Application of dimensional requirements to certain cases. 
(1)  If two or more permitted principal uses occupy the same structure, then: 
a.  The yard requirements for the entire structure for each use shall be determined, and the greater of the yard requirements of each of the principal uses that occupies each floor shall be applied to that floor; and 
b.  All other dimensional requirements shall be the sum of the dimensional requirements for each of the principal uses computed separately except as provided in subsection 94-191(c)(2). 
(2)  The lot, yard, open space and coverage requirements shall not be applied to a grave site or structure erected thereon. 
(3)  A parcel consisting of an unregistered lot and a contiguous registered lot may be treated as a lot under the provisions of this chapter only on presentation of a single deed referring to the fact that a lot therein is unregistered and another lot therein is registered, and incorporating a description of the entire parcel, which deed has been recorded in both the Middlesex South District Registry of Deeds and the Middlesex South Land Registry District. 
(4)  The minimum total lot area for an institutional use in a residential district shall be 80,000 square feet. 
(Rev. Ords. 1974, ch. 29, §§ 7.1-7.8; Ord. No. 539, Art. I, 4-18-1989; Ord. No. 561, 3-5-1991; Ord. No. 564, 9-10-1991) 
Sec. 94-173. - Height limitations; residential off-street parking requirements; planned development amendments. 
(a)  There shall be a height limitation of 35 feet for multiple dwellings, hotels, and offices. The height limitation shall be effective for a period of two years. At the expiration of the two-year period the height limitations shall expire and the height limitations previously provided for in the zoning ordinance shall be revived. This limitation shall not apply in the Wellington Circle area to those parcels on which construction is proposed by Cabot, Cabot and Forbes. These parcels are set forth as the circled areas on a plan which is on file in the city office. 
(b)  The board of appeals shall have no power to authorize use variances. 
(c)  There shall be an increase in the requirements of residential off-street parking. Such increase shall not become effective until the date that follows by one year the enactment thereof. 
(d)  The city council shall enact no planned development amendment to the zoning ordinance and any such amendment that may have been enacted is repealed. 
Editor's note- This section, which amends the zoning ordinance, was adopted on November 3, 1987, pursuant to an initiative petition and referendum. 
Secs. 94-174-94-190. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 94-191. - General parking and loading requirements. 
(a)  Intent. It is the intent of this division to reduce congestion in the streets and contribute to traffic safety by assuring adequate places for the standing and storing off the street of motor vehicles associated with any use of land and to insure that any use of the land involving the arrival, departure, storage, or entry upon the land of motor vehicles be so designed and operated as to reduce hazard to pedestrians upon the public sidewalks and to protect the use of adjoining property from nuisance caused by the noise, fumes, and glare of headlights which may result from the operation and parking of motor vehicles off the street. 
(b)  Off-street parking requirements. 
(1)  In any district parking spaces shall be provided at a rate specified in section 94-148. The parking requirement for uses 18 and 19 as listed in the table in section 94-148(d) may be applied as follows, if authorized by a special permit from the board of appeals. There may not be less than one parking place for every ten dwelling units provided that the following additional terms and conditions be met: the board finds that the special parking needs for occupants and visitors will be less than the parking facilities otherwise required by this chapter, and that the term and condition be imposed in the granting of the permit that a sufficient area exists and will be retained on the same lot or group of lots for parking as this chapter otherwise requires for multiple dwellings, and the further term and condition be imposed that the special permission shall cease and the special permit expire when the special occupancy of the unit giving rise to the need for the permit has ceased. 
(2)  In residential districts, the number of off-street parking spaces shall not exceed 200 percent of the minimum requirements. 
(3)  Parking spaces not enclosed in a structure may be provided anywhere on the lot except in an inner court, except that no parking may be provided within the required front yards in SF-1, SF-2, and GR district. 
When parking is provided in a front yard, buffer strips at least three feet in width and planted with dense planting material or an opaque fence of uniform appearance, should be provided on the side(s) of the parking area visible from the abutting street(s) and lot(s). 
(4)  Any parking space not located on the same lot as the structure or use to which it is assigned, whether or not in the same ownership, in order to be credited to such structure or use in meeting the requirements of this chapter, must be legally available and be within 200 feet of the structure, measured within street rights-of-way. Proof of legal availability and permanence consistent with subsection 94-191(c)(3) shall be required. Failure to retain the availability of such parking space for the need it is required to serve shall be sufficient cause to deny or revoke an occupancy permit until such space is restored or replaced. 
(5)  Parking spaces shall be designed for occupancy only by passenger cars and commercial vehicles not exceeding 71/2 feet in width or 18 feet in length, unless the parking spaces are specifically identified on a plan accompanying an application for a building permit or occupancy permit with sufficient area and adequate width of aisles for the vehicle intended. Except for vehicles exceeding 71/2 feet in width or 18 feet in length: 
a.  The minimum parking space will include a rectangular area not less than nine feet in width and 19 feet in length for all angle parking, or 22 feet in length for parallel parking and eight feet of clear height. 
For multiple dwellings where the required parking is 20 or more spaces, up to 30 percent of the angle parking spaces may be designated for compact cars, and include a minimum rectangular area of not less than eight feet in width and 17 feet in length per space. 
For nonresidential structures, up to 30 percent of all spaces may be designated for compact cars, and include a minimum rectangular area of not less than 71/2 feet in width by 19 feet in length for parallel spaces and 71/2 feet in width by 17 feet in length for angle spaces. 
b.  The minimum width of aisles providing access to more than two spaces, and designed for two-way traffic shall be at least 24 feet. 
c.  Minimum width of aisles providing access to more than two spaces, and designed for one-way traffic only, depending on the angle of parking shall be: 
Angle of 
Parking Minimum 
Aisle Width Parallel 12 feet 30° 11 feet 45° 13 feet 60° 18 feet 90° 20 feet  
(6)  The width of entrance and exit drives at the street line which provide access to parking areas shall be as follows: 
a.  The minimum width of entrance and exit drives shall be 12 feet for one-way use, or for driveways providing access primarily for overnight parking with only incidental day-use, and 20 feet in all other instances. 
b.  The maximum width of drives at the street line shall be 20 feet in residential districts and 30 feet in all other districts. 
(7)  All outdoor parking areas containing more than four spaces shall be screened from adjacent property in manner and to the extent required by subsection 94-142(a). 
(8)  No part of any outdoor parking area provided for multiple dwellings shall be located closer than six feet from a principal building. The ends and sides of parking spaces adjacent to such buildings shall be defined by a raised curb or berm. 
(c)  General off-street parking and loading requirements. All off-street parking and loading spaces and facilities shall conform to the requirements provided in this subsection. 
(1)  In computing the required number of parking and loading spaces, if the application of the rate results in a fraction of one half or greater, an additional full space shall be required. Each parking and loading space provided shall be exclusive of drives and maneuvering space. 
(2)  Where mixed uses occur, parking and loading spaces required shall be the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses, computed separately except when it can be demonstrated to the building commissioner that such uses are not in operation at the same time and that adequate spaces exist to handle the requirements for each use. 
(3)  All required parking and loading spaces shall be provided and maintained for as long as the use exists for which these spaces were designed and required. No off-street parking or loading area shall be used for any use that interferes with its availability for the need it is required to serve. 
(4)  No parking area containing more than two spaces and no loading area shall be designed or located so as to require or encourage motor vehicles to back or otherwise maneuver on the sidewalk. 
(5)  There shall be easy and ordinarily available access from any off-street parking or loading space to the street. 
(6)  No part of any entrance and exit drives for parking areas containing more than two spaces and loading areas shall be closer than 20 feet to one another, nor located closer than ten feet from a side lot line, measured at the street line. No part of any entrance and exit drive for parking areas and loading areas shall be closer than 20 feet from a street intersection, measured at the street line. 
(7)  All parking and loading spaces and their access shall be graded, surfaced with asphalt or other suitable material and drained to the extent necessary to prevent dust, erosion, or excessive water flow injurious to the use of surrounding property. 
(8)  Any outdoor lighting of parking or loading area shall be so arranged that no light source shall be visible from any point on surrounding properties. 
(9)  No part of any parking or loading area shall be located closer than five feet from a lot line if the provisions of subsection 94-142(a) apply, or three feet from a lot line in all other instances. The ends and sides of parking and loading spaces adjacent to a lot line shall be defined by a raised curb or berm. 
(d)  Off-street loading requirements. 
(1)  In any district, loading spaces shall be provided at the rate specified in section 94-148 and as follows:

(2)  Where retail sales, consumer service business or other uses are designed or constructed as a group or as a unified building, and while common loading facilities are shared, the aggregate of individual uses may be treated as one building for the purpose of calculating off-street loading requirements. 
(3)  Loading spaces not enclosed in a structure may be provided in a side or rear yard, but not in a front yard or court. However, loading spaces serving enclosed retail malls, where individual stores front inward onto a mall-type pedestrian area, may be located in a front yard provided that said spaces are adequately screened and protected. 
(4)  All loading spaces shall be provided entirely on the lot with the principal use served. 
(5)  The minimum loading space shall include a rectangular area not less than 12 feet in width, 30 feet in length, and 14 feet of clear height directly accessible to aisles of adequate width. 
(6)  The minimum width of entrance and exit drives which provide access to loading spaces shall be 20 feet and the maximum width shall be 30 feet, measured at the street line. 
(7)  Loading spaces may be enclosed in a structure and must be so enclosed if located in or within 50 feet of a residential district where the use involves regular night operation. 
(8)  Loading spaces provided in or within 100 feet of a residential district must be adequately screened from adjacent residences.

DIVISION 4. - MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICTS 

Sec. 94-211. - General provisions. 
    Any land contained within the mixed use zoning district shall be subject to all of the provisions of this division, and to all of the other provisions of the this chapter, except where the provisions of this division conflict with other provisions of the this chapter, in which event the provisions of this division shall govern. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of article V, (Signs), shall apply in the mixed use zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.1), 2-2-1988) 
Sec. 94-212. - Height limitations. 
    Any building or structure in an MUZ district shall not exceed 100 feet or seven stories in height (exclusive of mechanical and elevator penthouses), except that: A building principally devoted to hotel or multiple dwelling residential use adjacent to a public open space may have a height which does not exceed the lesser of 130 feet or 12 stories. A building shall be considered to be adjacent to a public open space if it is on a lot which abuts land held for or devoted to recreational use open to the public, such as a park, marina or forest, and there exists no principal structure between such building and such land so held or devoted. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.2), 2-2-1988; Ord. No. 701, § 5, 6-3-2003) 
Sec. 94-213. - Landscaped open space; lot coverage. 
(a)  Any lot in an MUZ district, other than a lot having a principal structure devoted primarily to parking uses, shall have landscaped open space equal to at least ten percent of the lot area. Any lot having a principal structure devoted primarily to parking uses shall contain landscaped open space equal to at least ten percent of the lot area. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, in the MUZ district, landscaped open space shall include, in addition to planted areas, such items as streetscape elements (lights, planters, benches, etc.), outdoor areas devoted to dining, cafe or similar uses, and decorative surface treatments for sidewalks and other hard surfaces (such as pavers, cobblestones or concrete surface treatments designed to resemble pavers or cobblestones). 
(b)  Any lot in an MUZ district, other than a lot having a principal structure devoted primarily to parking uses, shall have lot coverage which does not exceed 45 percent, except that the city council may, by special permit granted pursuant to section 94-220, increase by ten percent (i.e., to 49.5 percent) the maximum lot coverage. Any lot in an MUZ district having a principal structure devoted primarily to parking uses may have lot coverage not in excess of 85 percent, except that the city council may, by special permit granted pursuant to section 94-220, increase by ten percent (i.e., to 93.5 percent) the maximum lot coverage. Lot coverage shall exclude below grade parking. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.3), 2-2-1988; Ord. No. 701, §§ 6, 7, 6-3-2003) 
Sec. 94-214. - Floor area ratio. 
(a)  Floor area ratio ("FAR") shall mean the ratio of gross floor area of a structure or structures on a lot to the area of the lot. For the purposes of calculating floor area ratio, gross floor area (GFA) shall have the meaning set forth in section 94-3; provided however, that no parking garage or underground parking area, whether or not required to meet the minimum parking requirements of this chapter, shall constitute GFA. 
(b)  In an MUZ district, any lot shall not have an FAR in excess of the "FAR base" (as hereinafter defined), except as set forth in subsection (c) below. There shall be no FAR for residential uses in the MUZ district. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in an MUZ district the FAR on a lot may exceed the FAR base if there is a corresponding decrease in GFA and FAR on another lot within the same MUZ district, as hereinafter specified, provided, however, that the FAR on a lot shall not exceed the "FAR Maximum" (as hereinafter defined). The FAR base shall be 2.25, except that the city council may, by special permit granted pursuant to section 94-220, increase by ten percent (i.e., to 2.475) the FAR base, and, the FAR maximum shall be 2.475, except that the city council may, by special permit granted pursuant to section 94-220, increase by ten percent (i.e., to 2.7225) the FAR maximum. FAR shall be increased on a lot or lots (a lot on which such an increase occurs being referred to as a "benefited lot") and correspondingly decreased on another lot or lots (a lot on which such a decrease occurs being referred to as a "burdened lot") as follows: 
(1)  The FAR on a benefited lot shall be increased as follows: the then permitted FAR on the benefited lot (i.e., 2.25, as the same may have been previously increased or decreased by operation of this section 94-214) shall be multiplied by the lot area of the benefited lot; to that product there shall be added the number of square feet of GFA transferred from the burdened lot or lots, and the resulting sum shall be divided by the lot area of the benefited lot to yield the then-permitted FAR for the benefited lot. 
(2)  The FAR on a burdened lot shall be reduced as follows: the then-permitted FAR on the burdened lot (i.e., 2.25, as the same may have been previously increased or decreased by operation of this section 94-214) shall be multiplied by the lot area of the burdened lot; from that product there shall be subtracted the number of square feet of GFA transferred to the benefited lot or lots, and the resulting sum shall be divided by the lot area of the burdened lot to yield the then-permitted FAR for the burdened lot. 
By way of example, if, in an MUZ district, Lot A contained a lot area of 80,000 square feet and Lot B contained a lot area of 100,000 square feet, and neither the FAR base nor the FAR maximum has been increased by special permit, without any transfer of GFA or FAR under this section, the maximum GFA on Lot A would be 180,000 s.f. (80,000 × 2.25) and the maximum GFA on Lot B would be 225,000 s.f. (100,000 × 2.25). The FAR on Lot A could be increased and the FAR on Lot A could be decreased by the transfer from Lot B to Lot A of 10,000 s.f. of GFA. In that event, the FAR of Lot A would be increased to 2.375 and the FAR of Lot B would be decreased to 2.15, determined as set forth in (1) and (2) above, as follows: 
Lot A: 2.25 (then-permitted FAR) times 80,000 (Lot area of Lot A) = 180,000 plus 10,000 (GFA transferred) = 190,000; divided by 80,000 (lot area of Lot A) = 2.375. 
Lot B: 2.25 (then-permitted FAR) times 100,000 (lot area of Lot B) 225,000; minus 10,000 (GFA transferred) = 215,000, divided by 100,000 (Lot area of Lot B) = 2.15. 
Under the foregoing example, because the resulting FAR on Lot A would not exceed 110 percent of the 2.25 FAR (i.e. 2,475), such a transfer is allowed. 
No building permit shall be issued for a building which would result in an FAR in excess of the FAR base on a benefited lot unless (i) the record owner of the burdened lot or lots has executed and recorded at the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds or the Middlesex South Registry district of the land court, as the case may be, an agreement, running with his land and binding on his successors and assigns, agreeing to a decrease in his GFA and FAR pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding paragraphs and (ii) the building inspector has been supplied with copies of such evidence as he deems reasonably necessary to satisfy himself that the person executing such agreement is the true record owner of the burdened lot, and that such agreement has been duly recorded or registered. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.4), 2-2-1988; Ord. No. 701, § 8, 6-3-2003) 
Sec. 94-215. - Setbacks. 
    In an MUZ district there are no side or rear yard setback requirements, so that a building may abut a side or rear lot line or a single building may be located on more than one lot and in so doing may be located over a side or rear lot line; provided that: 
(1)  The front yard setback of 15 feet for property within an MUZ district shall apply only to front yards abutting a municipally owned street, laid out and accepted as a city street pursuant to M.G.L.A. c. 82 as of the date on which such property is placed in an MUZ district; for any other street not so laid out and accepted, there shall be no front yard setback requirement, except as set out in section 94-215(2) below. 
(2)  No principal building or structure shall be located within 40 feet of the street sideline, existing on the date that property is placed in an MUZ district, of any of the numbered state highways, or county streets laid out and accepted as a street pursuant to M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 82 as of the date on which such property is placed in an MUZ district, in or adjacent to the city; in such locations the 40-foot setback shall be maintained as a front yard and loading spaces shall not be permitted within said 40-foot area. 
In addition, that portion of any building or structure which is above the lesser of five stories or 75 feet in height shall not be located within 50 feet of the street sideline, existing on the date that property is placed in an MUZ district, of any of the numbered state highways or said county ways in or adjacent to the city. 
(3)  All freestanding multi-story principal buildings or structures in the same MUZ district shall be located at least 40 feet from each other (unless attached to each other), without regard to the location of lot lines. 
(4)  No principal building or structure shall be located within five feet of property located in a zone other than MUZ. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.5), 2-2-1988; Ord. No. 701, § 9, 6-3-2003) 
Sec. 94-216. - Parking and loading requirements. 
    Certain of the parking and loading requirements of sections 94-148 and 94-191 shall be inapplicable to development in an MUZ district and in lieu thereof the parking and loading requirements set forth in this section 94-216 shall govern as follows (except that section 94-148(f)(4)e. sets forth the parking requirements for multiple dwelling residential in the MUZ district): 
(1)  In an MUZ district, the parking requirements calculated pursuant to section 94-148(d) or section 94-148(f) shall be reduced by five percent for any use, the parking requirements of which may be satisfied in whole or in part by spaces in a structure described in section 94-216(2). Further, whenever a use requires one space per 350 square feet of gross floor area, pursuant to section 91-148(d), and that use is reasonably accessible, by foot or shuttle, to public transportation, the city council may, by special permit granted pursuant to section 94-220, require only one space per 400 square feet of gross floor area. Further, for a structure in an MUZ district which is devoted principally to hotel uses and contains dwelling units and other uses which are accessory to hotel uses (such as restaurants, conference centers, function rooms, health clubs, or retail uses), the parking spaces required shall be one space per guest sleeping room plus 50 percent of the number of parking spaces required for accessory uses within a hotel under the provisions of this division and the other provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Notwithstanding section 94-191(b)(4), any parking space located on the same lot as the structure or use to which is assigned, whether or not in the same ownership, but located in the same MUZ district, in order to be credited to such structure or use in meeting the requirement of this chapter, must be legally available, as evidenced by bond, long term lease, easement or other assurance of permanence, the closest point of which garage or area is within 500 feet of the closest point of such structure, measured within public ways or private driveways, regardless of whether the space itself is within such distance. 
(3)  Notwithstanding subsection 94-191(b)(5)a., in an MUZ district the minimum parking space will include a rectangular area (i) in the case of parking spaces required for all hotel, retail and restaurant uses ("high turnover uses"), not less than 81/2 feet in width and 15 feet in length for all angle parking and nine feet in width and 22 feet in length for parallel parking, and (ii) in the case of parking spaces required for all other uses ("regular uses"), not less than eight feet in width and 18 feet in length for all angle parking and nine feet in width and 22 feet in length for parallel parking, and seven feet of clear height in all events. 
(4)  Notwithstanding subsection 94-191(b)(5)b., in an MUZ district the minimum width of aisles providing access to more than two spaces, and designed for two-way traffic shall be (i) in the cases of that portion of an aisle abutting spaces designed for high turnover uses, as set forth in paragraph (3) above, at least 24 feet, and in the case of any other aisles or portion thereof, at least 22.5 feet. 
(5)  Notwithstanding subsection 94-191(b)(6)b., in an MUZ district there shall be no maximum width of drives. 
(6)  Notwithstanding subsection 94-191(c)(6), in an MUZ district there shall be no minimum distances between two or more entrances and exit drives, and no minimum distances between entrance and exit drives and side lot lines. 
(7)  Notwithstanding subsection 94-191(c)(9), in an MUZ district there shall be no minimum distance between any parking or loading area and a lot line. 
(8)  Notwithstanding subsection 94-191(d)(1), loading spaces shall be provided for uses in an MUZ district at the following rates: 
a.  For any use item for which section 94-148 specifies one loading space per 50,000 square feet of gross floor area (a "type A use"), there shall be provided one loading space per 100,000 square feet of gross floor area; 
b.  For any use item for which section 94-148 specifies one loading space per 15,000 square feet of gross floor area (a "type B use"), there shall be provided one loading space per 50,000 square feet of gross floor area; provided further that, as part of site plan review under section 94-221, there may be restrictions imposed upon the hours of operation of certain on-site parking spaces so that such areas may be used at certain times as loading spaces to meet the requirements of this subsection b; 
c.  For any use item for which section 94-148 specifies no loading space requirement, no loading space shall be required (there shall be no loading space requirement for residential uses in the MUZ district); and 
d.  In any building containing both a type A use or uses and a type B use or uses, the total number of loading spaces required shall be determined by adding A and B, and rounding to the nearest whole number, where A is the product of the number of square feet of a type A use or uses divided by 100,000, and B is the product of the number of square feet of a type B use or uses divided by 30,000. For example, in a building containing 140,000 square feet of type A uses and 40,000 square feet of type B uses, the total number of loading bays required for the building would be three, determined as follows: 
A = 140,000 / 100,000 = 1.40 
B = 40,000 / 30,000 = 1.33 / 2.73 
A + B = 2.73 - rounded to nearest whole number = 3. 
Numbers ending in .50 shall be rounded up. 
(9)  Notwithstanding subsection 94-191(d)(3), in an MUZ district loading spaces may be provided in a front yard or court, subject, however, to the provisions of subsection 94-215(2). 
(10)  Notwithstanding subsection 94-191(d)(6), in an MUZ district there shall be no maximum width of entrance and exit drives which provide access to loading spaces. 
(11)  In an MUZ district, any parking structure shall be either underground or, if at grade or above grade, shall be either (i) located in a building the principal use of which is a parking garage, or (ii) if located in a building the principal use of which is not a parking garage, fully enclosed in a manner approved pursuant to site plan review. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.6), 2-2-1988; Ord. No. 701, §§ 11-13, 6-3-2003)

(3)  Use item 28, (outdoor automobile sales and storage). In no event shall outdoor storage of automobiles, whether or not associated with automobile sales, be permitted in an MUZ district. 
(4)  Use item 35 (manufacturing, including assembly, fabrication and processing and reprocessing of materials) is permitted in an MUZ district only to the extent (i) that such use is light industrial in nature (such as the manufacture, fabrication, processing, assembling and testing of products), (ii) is accessory to a principal use, and (iii) does not exceed 25 percent of the gross floor area of the structure; any manufacturing which is not accessory to a main use or exceeds 25 percent of the gross floor area of a structure shall be permitted only upon the grant of a special permit by the city council pursuant to section 94-220, provided that in any event only manufacturing which is light industrial in nature shall be permitted. 
(5)  Use item 35A (accessory day care center), and day care under Use Item 11, is permitted in an MUZ district only to the extent that there is provided, on the same lot or on another lot in the same MUZ district or in an ROS district, an outdoor play area conforming to size requirements under 102 CMR 7.00 (Commonwealth of Massachusetts Standards for the Licensure or Approval of Group Day Care Centers). To the extent that an outdoor play area which services a day care use in an MUZ district is located in an ROS district, such use of an ROS district for an outdoor play area is permitted, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection 94-148(d) (Table of Uses). 
(6)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in subsection 94-148(d) (Table of Uses), any private way included in a MUZ district may be used for ingress, egress and access to industrial uses in adjacent districts.

Sec. 94-218. - Performance standards in MUZ district. 
    All uses of land in an MUZ district shall comply with the following performance standards; provided, however, that these performance standards shall not be applicable to demolition, construction or rehabilitation work performed pursuant to an applicable demolition or building permit. If the building inspector has reasonable grounds to believe there is a violation of performance standards, such violation shall be subject to the performance standards procedure set forth in section 94-219. 
(1)  Sound. The volume of sound inherently and recurrently generated shall be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to adjacent users. 
(2)  Vibration. An operation which creates intense earthshaking vibration, e.g., heavy drop forges, heavy hydraulic surges, shall not be discernible beyond the property lines of the industry. 
(3)  Radioactivity. No operation shall be permitted which causes radioactivity in violation of Title 10, Chapter I, Part 20, Code of Federal Regulations, "Standards for Protection Against Radiation," dated June 16, 1957, or any subsequent revision or amendments. 
(4)  Odor. No emission of odorous gas or other odorous matter in such quantity as to be readily detectable at any point along lot lines without use of instruments shall be permitted.

(6)  Dust and fly ash. No solid or liquid particles shall be emitted in such quantity as to be readily detectable at any point along lot lines or as to produce a public nuisance or hazard beyond lot lines. 
(7)  Smoke. No smoke shall be emitted in such quantity as to become a nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.8), 2-2-1988) 
Sec. 94-219. - Performance standards procedure. 
(a)  Prior to construction and operation. Any application for a building permit for a use which eventually will be subject to performance standards shall be accompanied by a statement by the owner of the subject property that said use will be operated in accordance with the performance standards hereinabove set forth. 
(b)  Continued compliance. Continued compliance with performance standards is required and enforcement of continued compliance with these performance standards shall be enforced by the building inspector, as hereinafter set forth. 
(c)  Determination of violation. The building inspector shall investigate any purported violation of performance standards, and shall notify the office of community development of the occurrence or existence of a probable violation thereof, and, if feasible, shall consult with the owners of the property prior to giving a formal notice of violation to determine whether a violation actually exists and to determine a program for elimination of any such violation. If such consultation is not feasible or does not result in the adoption by the owner of a program for elimination of any violation satisfactory to the building inspector, the building inspector shall give formal notice, by registered or certified mail, to the owner, specifying with particularity the violation of the performance standard and ordering the owner to cure such violation. 
(d)  Termination of violation. The owner(s) shall cause all violations to be terminated within 30 days of the receipt of the formal notice of the building inspector. Any violation not terminated within such period shall be deemed a separate violation for each day following and shall be subject to fines by the building inspector of not more than $100.00 per day. 
(e)  Appeal of determination. If an owner of property is aggrieved by any action of the building inspector under the performance standards procedure, he shall be entitled to an appeal thereof pursuant to M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 8. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.9), 2-2-1988) 
Sec. 94-220. - Special permit. 
    Whenever the grant of a special permit is authorized pursuant to this division, the following procedures and standards shall govern. 
(1)  In each instance in which the grant of a special permit is authorized pursuant to this division, the city council shall decide such questions as are involved in determining whether special permits should be granted, hear applications for special permits, and grant a special permit when all necessary conditions are met or deny that special permit when all necessary conditions are not met, or when the matter which requires a special permit is, in their judgment, not in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. Special permits shall only be issued following public hearings held as provided for in M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 9. This subsection shall not apply to petitions submitted under section 94-148 requesting a special permit to operate a body art establishment. 
(2)  The city council shall act within 90 days following a public hearing for which notice has been given by publication and posting as provided in M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 11 and by mailing to all parties in interest. This subsection shall not apply to petitions submitted under section 94-148 requesting a special permit to operate a body art establishment. 
(3)  The city council, upon receipt of an application for a special permit, shall: 
a.  Forward such application to the community development board. 
b.  The community development board shall, within 45 days, review said application and make recommendations as it deems appropriate and send copies thereof to the city council and to the applicant. Failure of the board to make recommendations within 45 days of receipt by said board of the petition shall be deemed lack of opposition thereto. 
(4)  A special permit granted under this section shall lapse within two years, and including such time required to pursue or await the determination of an appeal referred to in M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 17, from the grant thereof, if a substantial use thereof has not sooner commenced except for good cause or, in the case of permit for construction, if construction has not begun by such date except for good cause. 
(5)  Applications for special permits shall not be approved unless the following standards are met and the city council so finds: 
a.  That the use of the structures is permitted as of right or by special permit. 
b.  That the use and structures are so designed, located and proposed to be operated that the public health, safety, welfare and convenience will be protected. 
c.  That the use and structures will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood where it is to be located. 
d.  That the use and structures will be compatible with adjoining development and the proposed character of the zone district where it is to be located. 
e.  That adequate landscaping and screening is provided as required herein so as to minimize the impact of the proposed use or structure and any incidental effects thereof. 
f.  That adequate off-street parking and loading is provided and ingress and egress is so designed as to cause minimum interference with traffic on abutting streets. 
g.  That the use conforms with all applicable regulations governing the district where located. 
h.  That such other requirements under M.G.L.A. c. 40A for the grant of a special permit have been satisfied. 
(6)  In granting a special permit, additional specific conditions, safeguards and limitations on time or use as are deemed necessary to insure compliance with the intent of this chapter or to protect the neighborhood may be attached. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 5(10A.10), 2-2-1988; Ord. No. 733, § 1, 6-26-07) 
Sec. 94-221. - Site plan review in an MUZ district. 
(a)  Purpose of site plan review. For the purposes of insuring that there shall be no development in an MUZ district except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, in an MUZ district no structure shall be constructed, reconstructed or used, and no improvements to any lot shall be made, unless such development is in conformity with a site plan which has been reviewed by the community development board (CDB) in accordance with the provisions of subsections 94-221(c) through 94-221(k). 
(b)  Preliminary site plan. When a petition is filed with the city council for a zone change from the text or map of this chapter, an applicant shall submit three black or blue line copies of a preliminary site plan with such application. Additional copies of plans may be requested by the CDB for distribution to other concerned departments or agencies. A preliminary site plan shall consist of: 
(1)  A map or maps prepared to a scale of not less than one inch to 40 feet; and shall set forth: 
a.  Name and address of the owner of the land and name of any proposed developments;

Within the time periods specified in subsection 94-221(d), the community development board shall make a final written approval or disapproval on any site plan submitted to it, which determination shall be in accordance with section 94-220. The vote of a majority of the members of the community development board shall bind the community development board hereunder, and the failure of the community development board to act within the time periods specified herein shall be deemed to constitute a determination that the site plan submitted to the community development board conforms with the criteria set forth in this section. The community development board shall advise the building inspector and the city clerk in writing of their action. 
(e)  Site plan fee. In order to provide funding to the CDB to analyze a site plan, the applicant shall pay a fee as set forth in the fee schedule in appendix A to these Revised Ordinances per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area contained within buildings in the area subject to site plan review, but no more than a maximum per principal building as set forth in the fee schedule in appendix A to these Revised Ordinaces. The fee shall be paid by certified check to the City of Medford upon submission of the plan to the community development board.

(f)  Approved plan prerequisite to issuance of building permit. No building permit shall be issued under this article until a final site plan, or applicable components thereof have been approved or deemed to have been approved by the community development board. 
(g)  Expiration of approval prior to commencement of development. Unless construction of a development which has been approved by the community development board shall have commenced within 18 months from the date of approval of the site plan, the approval shall be deemed to have expired, the building permit shall thereupon be revoked and the building inspector shall forthwith take the necessary steps to enforce this subsection. 
(h)  Modifications to approved site plans. If an owner wishes to modify an approved site plan he may submit a revised site plan to community development board for review and approval, and the same standards and procedures applicable to, the review of the original site plan shall apply to such revised site plan. 
(i)  Standards and criteria for review and final action. In acting under this section, the community development board shall review a site plan to ensure that the public health, safety, and welfare are best served in light of the following criteria: 
(1)  The provisions for vehicular loading and unloading, parking and for vehicular circulation on the site and onto adjacent public streets and ways will promote safety and safe traffic control and flow; 
(2)  The bulk, location, density, setback, and height of proposed buildings and structures and paved areas and the proposed uses thereof are in conformity with the requirements of this chapter and will not be detrimental to development in the neighborhood; 
(3)  The provision for on-site landscaping will provide a visual buffer to neighboring properties; 
(4)  Provisions for pedestrian ways will provide safe and convenient access and egress (i) within the area of site plan review and (ii) to the boundary of such area in light of existing or proposed pedestrian ways beyond such boundary; 
(5)  The site plan will provide for adequate and proper drainage, sewage disposal, and water supply; 
(6)  The provisions for exterior lighting will promote safety to motorists traveling on adjacent public streets; 
(7)  The proposed development will provide adequate access to the site, or to the buildings on the site, for emergency vehicles; 
(8)  Parking structures shall comply with subsection 94-216(11). 
(j)  Finding. All findings of the community development board shall be in writing, and determination with respect to site plans shall either be (a) that the site plan conforms to the criteria set forth in section 94-219 or (b) that the site plan does not so conform and specifying with particularly how it does not conform and how it may be modified to so conform. 
This site plan review procedure is not intended to constitute a special permit procedure, and it is presumed that a site plan submitted to the community development board which complies in all respect with the dimensional, use and other requirements of the chapter (an "as of right plan") will be approved by community development board or will be disapproved with such reasonable and specific suggested modifications specified by the community development board which will cause the site plan to conform with the criteria set forth in section 94-219, and which will not substantially derogate from the marketability or quality of the development under the as of right plan, will not reduce the total amount of gross floor area under the as of right plan except for minor reductions (but in no event greater than five percent) incidental to such suggested modifications, and will not alter the number of parking spaces or any of the other amenities which would have been provided under the as of right plan. 
(k)  Appeal. If an applicant is aggrieved by any action of the community development board under this section 94-221, he shall be entitled to an appeal therefrom pursuant to M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 8, within 30 days from the date of the action which is being appealed.

Sec. 94-241. - Nonconforming single- and two-family residential structure. 
(a)  A single- or two-family residential structure may be altered, reconstructed, extended or structurally changed if said alteration, reconstruction, extension, or structural change does not increase the nonconforming nature of the structure. 
(b)  Any increase in area, frontage, width, yard, or depth requirements shall not apply to a lot for single- or two-family residential use which at the time of recording or endorsement, whichever occurs sooner was not held in common ownership with any adjoining land, conformed to then existing requirements and has less than the proposed requirements but at least 5,000 square feet of area and 50 feet of frontage. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a lot being built upon, if at the time of the building, building upon such lot is not prohibited. 
(Rev. Ords. 1974, ch. 29, § 11.1) 
Sec. 94-242. - Nonconforming structures other than single- and two-family residential structures. 
    Pre-existing nonconforming structures or uses may be extended or altered, provided, that no such extension or alteration shall be permitted unless there is a finding by the board of appeals that such change, extension, or alteration shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood. This section shall not apply to billboards, signs and other advertising devices subject to the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 93, §§ 29 through 33, inclusive, and to M.G.L.A. c. 93D.

Sec. 94-243. - Nonconforming lots. 
(a)  Vacant lots. If a definitive plan, or a preliminary plan followed within seven months by a definitive plan, is submitted to the community development board for approval under the subdivision control law, and written notice of such submission has been given to the city clerk before the effective date of ordinance, the land shown on such plan shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the zoning ordinances, if any, in effect at the time of the first such submission while such plan or plans are being processed under the subdivision control law, and, if such definitive plan or an amendment thereof is finally approved for five years from the date of the endorsement of such approval, except in the case where such plan was submitted or submitted and approved before January 1, 1976, for seven years from the date of the endorsement of such approval. 
When a plan referred to in M.G.L.A. c. 41, § 81P has been submitted to the community development board and written notice of such submission has been given to the city clerk, the use of the land shown on such plan shall be governed by applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of the submission of such plan while such plan is being processed under the subdivision control law including the time required to pursue or await the determination of an appeal referred to in said section, and for a period of three years from the date of endorsement by the community development board that approval under the subdivision control law is not required, or words of similar import. 
Disapproval of a plan shall not serve to terminate any rights which shall have accrued under the provisions of this division, provided an appeal from the decision disapproving said plan is made under applicable provisions of the subdivision control law. Such appeal shall stay, pending an order or decree of a court of final jurisdiction, the applicability to land shown on said plan of the provisions of any zoning ordinance which became effective after the date of submission of the plan first submitted. 
In the event that any lot shown on a plan endorsed by the community development board is the subject matter of any appeal or any litigation, the exemptive provisions of this section shall be extended for a period equal to that from the date of filing of said appeal or the commencement of litigation, whichever is earlier, to the date of final disposition thereof, provided final adjudication is in favor of the owner of said lot. 
The record owner of the land shall have the right, at any time, by an instrument duly recorded in the registry of deeds for the district in which the land lies, to waive the provisions of this division, in which case the provisions then or thereafter in effect shall apply. The submission of an amended plan or of a further subdivision of all or part of the land shall not constitute such a waiver, nor shall it have the effect of further extending the applicability of this chapter that was extended by the original submission but, if accompanied by the waiver described above, shall have the effect of extending, but only to extend aforesaid, the provisions made then applicable by such waiver. 
(b)  Lots already built upon. 
(1)  Any lot that has been built upon which does not conform with the minimum area, frontage, width, depth or yard requirements may be changed in size and shape if no nonconformity to the provisions of this chapter is increased or violation created. 
(2)  Any lot that has been built upon may be changed in size and shape so as to create or increase violations of the provisions of this chapter if such change is due to a public taking of a portion of the lot.

(b)  Nonconforming uses of structured or of structures and land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, lawful use of a structure or of a structure and land in combination exists that is no longer permissible under the term of this chapter as enacted or amended, such nonconforming use may be continued subject to the following provisions:

(3)  Any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land, may be replaced only by a conforming use, except as specified in section 94-148. 
(4)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination in or on which a nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the use regulations for the district in which such structure or structure and land is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(5)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination is discontinued, or abandoned for a period of two years or more, as determined by the building commissioner, then that structure or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the use regulations of the district in which it is located. Nonuse for a period of two years or more shall be prima facie evidence of intent to abandon unless the owner of the land on which such use is situated notifies the building commissioner in writing within this time period that such discontinuance is not an abandonment of the use.

Sec. 94-246. - Rebuilding after catastrophe. 
(a)  If a nonconforming structure devoted to a conforming use is damaged or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe to such an extent that the cost of restoration would equal or exceed 75 percent of the current replacement value of the building as estimated by the building commissioner, or if that structure is declared by the building commissioner to be structurally unsafe for occupancy, then such structure shall not be restored or reconstructed and may be replaced only by a structure which conforms to the restrictions of that district and which is designed for and to be devoted to a conforming use. If the cost of restoration would be less than 75 percent of the current replacement value, then the structure may be rebuilt or restored not in excess of its former dimensions, except as herein provided. 
(b)  If a conforming or a nonconforming structure devoted to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe to such an extent that the cost of restoration would equal or exceed 50 percent of the current replacement value of the structure as estimated by the building commissioner or if that structure is declared by the building commissioner to be structurally unsafe for occupancy, then such structure or use shall not be restored or reconstructed and may be replaced only by a structure designed and to be devoted to a conforming use. If the cost of restoration would be less than 50 percent of the current replacement value, then the structure may be rebuilt or restored, not in excess of its former dimensions, except as hereinafter provided. 
(c)  If a nonconforming portion of a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe to such an extent that the cost of restoration would equal or exceed 50 percent of the current replacement value of that portion as estimated by the building commissioner, then such portion shall not be restored or reconstructed except in conformance with the dimensional requirements of this chapter. If the cost of restoration would be less than 50 percent of the current replacement value, then the portion may be rebuilt or restored not in excess of its former dimensions. 
(d)  If a conforming or a nonconforming residential structure is intended to be replaced, rebuilt or restored in accordance with the provisions of section 94-246 for a conforming use, nonconforming lot size alone shall not be construed as adequate grounds to prevent a replacement, rebuilding or restoration. 
(e)  If rebuilding or restoration of a nonconforming structure is permitted under the preceding paragraphs, then it shall be carried out subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No nonconformity shall be increased beyond its extent prior to the catastrophe.

Sec. 94-506. - Mandatory provision of affordable units. 
    As a condition of approval for a special permit for a covered project, the applicant shall contribute to the local stock of affordable unit in accordance with the following requirements: 
(1)  Ten to 24 lots or units-Ten percent affordable units. 
(2)  Twenty-five to 49 lots or units-Thirteen percent affordable units.

(b)  As a condition for the granting of a special permit for a covered project, all affordable housing units shall be subject to an affordable housing restriction and a regulatory agreement in a form acceptable to the community development board. The regulatory agreement shall be consistent with any applicable guidelines issued by the Department of Housing and Community Development and any other applicable state or federal funding source and shall ensure that affordable units can be counted toward the city's subsidized housing inventory. In the case of a subdivision, no lot or unit shall be sold until an approved regulatory agreement is recorded at the registry of deeds. In the case of a construction project subject to a building permit, no certificate of final occupancy shall be issued until an approved regulatory agreement is recorded at the registry of deeds and the building commissioner is notified by the director of the office of community development or her representative that the project is progressing in a satisfactory manner in fulfilling its affordable housing requirement. 
(c)  All covered projects shall comply with the following: 
(1)  Fractional units-Where the required number of affordable units results in a fraction of a unit, the required number should be rounded up to the nearest whole number; 
(2)  Phasing-Affordable units should not be the last units to be developed or occupied in any covered project; 
(3)  Non-avoidance by phasing or segmentation--A development shall not be phased or segmented in a manner to avoid compliance with this section.

This section shall also be enforceable against purchasers of land previously held in common ownership with land that received, after the date of adoption of this section, approvals or permits for development, to the effect that units developed under such previous development shall be counted toward the calculation of number of units under this section. 
(Ord. No. 836, § 6.0, 2-19-2019) 
Sec. 94-507. - Provisions applicable to affordable housing units. 
    The following criteria shall apply. 
(1)  Siting of affordable units. All affordable units constructed or rehabilitated under this article shall be situated within the development so as not to be in less desirable locations than market-rate units in the development and shall, on average, be no less accessible to public amenities, such as open space, as the market-rate units. 
(2)  Minimum design and construction standards for affordable units. Affordable housing units shall be integrated with the rest of the development and shall be compatible in design, appearance, construction, and quality of materials with other units. Interior features and mechanical systems of affordable units shall conform to the same specifications as apply to market-rate units. 
(3)  Timing of construction or provision of affordable units or lots. Where feasible, affordable housing units shall be provided coincident to the development of market-rate units. 
(4)  Marketing plan for affordable units. Applicants under this article shall submit an affirmative marketing plan to the director of diversity and DHCD, which describes how the affordable units will be marketed to potential home buyers or tenants. This plan shall include a description of the lottery or other process to be used for selecting buyers or tenants.

(b)  The maximum income level is as established by the commonwealth's Department of Housing and Community Development, and as may be revised from time to time. The maximum housing cost for affordable units is as established by the commonwealth's Department of Housing and Community Development, local initiative program or as required by other state or federal programs. If multiple funding sources are used, the units must still be eligible for inclusion on the subsidized housing inventory. 
(Ord. No. 836, § 8.0, 2-19-2019) 
Sec. 94-509. - Preservation of affordability; restrictions on resale. 
    Each affordable unit created in accordance with this ordinance shall have limitations governing its resale through the use of a regulatory agreement The purpose of these limitations is to preserve the long-term affordability of the unit and to ensure its continued availability for affordable income households. The resale controls shall be established through a restriction on the property and shall be in force for perpetuity. 
(1)  Resale price. Sales beyond the initial sale to a qualified affordable income purchaser shall comply with the requirements of the DHCD local initiative program. 
(2)  Right of first refusal to purchase. The purchaser of an affordable housing unit developed as a result of this article shall agree to execute a condition in its deed restriction to be approved by the city and DHCD, granting, among other things, the municipality's and DHCD's right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event that a subsequent qualified purchaser cannot be located. 
(3)  The SPGA shall require, as a condition for special permit under this bylaw, that the applicant comply with the mandatory set-asides and accompanying restrictions on affordability, including the execution of the deed rider. The building commission shall not issue an occupancy permit for any affordable unit without evidence of the recording of the affordable deed restriction. 
(Ord. No. 836, § 8.0, 2-19-2019) 
Sec. 94-510. - Conflict with other ordinances. 
    The provisions of this article shall be considered supplemental of existing zoning ordinances. To the extent that a conflict exists between this article and others, the more restrictive ordinance, or provisions therein, shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 836, § 9.0, 2-19-2019) 
Sec. 94-511. - Severability. 
    If any provision of this article is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the article shall not be affected thereby. The invalidity of any section or sections or parts of any section or sections of this bylaw shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the city's zoning ordinance.
