PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Springdale, Arkansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1973 Code, as supplemented through June 23, 1992, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of David G. Poucher, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mida Neff, City Clerk, Jeff Harper, City Attorney, and Charles N. McKinney, Mayor, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

If the person to whom such notice and order is addressed cannot be found after diligent search, then such notice and order shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of such person; and a copy of such notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises to which it relates. Such mailing and posting shall be deemed adequate service. 
b.  Any owner, agent or person in control of such building or structure who shall fail, neglect or refuse within the stated time to comply with the notice from the building official to repair, rehabilitate or to demolish such building or structure or portion thereof shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalties set out in section 22-7 of the Code of Ordinances. 
c.  In case the owner, agent or person in control cannot be found within the stated time, or, if such owner, agent or person in control shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the notice to repair, rehabilitate or to demolish and remove such building or structure or portion thereof, the building official shall refer the matter of removing the building to the city council. If the city council deems the structure unsafe and that it is in the best interest of the city to proceed with the removal of the unsafe structure, it shall enact an ordinance ordering the property owner to raze and remove the unsafe structure, with work thereon to commence within ten days and be completed within 30 days.

Such bond shall be made payable to the city and for such amount as he prescribes. It shall indemnify the city against any damage caused by the moving of such building to streets, curbs, sidewalks, shade trees, lights and signals, shade trees, highways and any other property, which may be affected, by the moving of a building. Such surety bond shall also be conditioned upon and liable for strict compliance with the terms of said permit, as to route to be taken and limit of time in which to effect such removal and of repair or compensate for the repair and to pay said applicable governing body as liquidated damages an amount not exceeding $50.00 to be prescribed by the building official for each and every day's delay in completing such removal or in repairing any damages to property or public improvement or in clearing all public streets, alleys or highways of all debris occasioned thereby. 
c.  Whenever it shall be necessary to interfere with wires or cables of a public utility in moving a building, the terms of any special or franchise ordinance governing it shall apply and the bond therein specified shall be given in addition to the bond as required by section (b) above. If no such terms apply, then the chief building inspector shall determine the expense of repairing the wires and the bond to be given to cover such expense. 
d.  Upon the issuance of said moving permit, the chief building inspector shall cause notice to be given to the superintendent of fire alarm, chief of fire department, telephone and electric companies, or others whose property may be affected by such removal. The building department shall set forth in all notices the route that will be taken, time started, and approximate time of completion. 
e.  Every building which occupies any portion of public property after sundown shall have sufficient lights continuously burning between sunset and sunrise for the protection of the public. There shall be a minimum of five red lights placed on each street side of the building. Such red lights shall be attached to the building in such a fashion as to indicate extreme width, height and size. In addition to the red lights on the building, flares shall be placed at regular intervals for a distance of 200 feet up the street on each side of the building.

b.  Provide means for the inspector to enter the locked premises to make an inspection requested by the electrical contractor. 
c.  Comply with the provisions of this chapter.

The design of the fire protection loop must be approved by the commission engineering staff prior to the issuance of a building permit or approval of a development. The fire protection loop and easements within which it is located shall be transferred to the commission to maintain and operate.

Sec. 50-26. - Statutory authority. 
    The Legislature of the State of Arkansas has in A.C.A. § 14-268-101 et seq., delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Springdale, Arkansas, does hereby ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 4110, § 1, 9-11-07) 
Sec. 50-27. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified Special Flood Hazard Areas of Springdale in the current scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Benton County, Arkansas and Incorporated Areas" dated June 5, 2012, with an effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM) dated June 5, 2012 and "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Washington County, Arkansas and Incorporated Areas," dated May 16, 2008, with an effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM) dated May 16, 2008. 
(b)  These special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic flooding events that result in loss of life and property, pose health and safety hazards, disrupt commerce and governmental services, and cause extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(c)  These periodic flooding events are exacerbated by the cumulative effect of floodplain developments which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the placement of inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected structures or uses vulnerable to floods into special flood hazard areas. Such structures or uses are inherently hazardous 
(d)  In addition to the FIS and FIRM for Washington County noted in paragraph (a) above, FEMA has approved the conditional letter of map revision cited in Case Number 13-06-3506R which affects the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) for Spring Creek in the area between Johnson Road and Shiloh Street. This conditional letter of map revision is hereby adopted and will be enforced as the regulatory SFHA for this area until such time a new map is issued by FEMA including this revision and adopted by the city in whole. 
(Ord. No. 4110, § 2, 9-11-07; Ord. No. 4579, § 1, 4-10-12; Ord. No. 4763, § 1, 1-28-14) 
Sec. 50-28. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain development activities, and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding events in identified special flood hazard areas. This article advances the stated purpose through provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Protect natural floodplains against unwise development; 
(3)  Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development; 
(4)  Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects; 
(5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events; 
(7)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas; 
(8)  Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base; and 
(9)  Provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a special flood hazard area. 
(Ord. No. 4110, § 3, 9-11-07) 
Sec. 50-29. - Lands to which this article applies. 
    The article shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of Springdale, Arkansas. 
(Ord. No. 4110, § 4, 9-11-07) 
Sec. 50-30. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    This article uses the following methods to accomplish the stated purpose: 
(1)  This article restricts or prohibits structures or uses in special flood hazard areas that adversely impact health, safety or property during flooding events; 
(2)  This article requires protection against flood damage for structures or uses vulnerable to floods at the time of initial construction, or after substantial improvement of the structure, or after substantial damage has occurred; 
(3)  This article controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation and transport of floodwaters; 
(4)  This article controls floodplain development (structural development, placement of manufactured structures, clearing, grading, mining, drilling, dredging, placement of fill, excavating, watercourse alteration, drainage improvements, roadway or bridge construction, individual water or sewer installations and other activities) which may increase flood damage by increasing flood elevations, floodwater velocities, or flood discharge patterns; 
(5)  This article regulates the construction of flood barriers which unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may adversely impact other lands. 
(Ord. No. 4110, § 5, 9-11-07) 
Sec. 50-31. - Flood damage prevention code adopted by reference. 
    There is hereby adopted by reference a "Flood Damage Prevention Code for Springdale, Arkansas," dated September 2007. The code shall include:

(Ord. No. 3306, 3-25-03) 
Sec. 56-31. - Street frontage, interior, and perimeter. 
    Each development is required to address all three areas in the landscaping plan as it pertains to the particular site. The landscaping plan must include plantings and green space along all street right-of-ways, between lots with adjacent parking lots and also within the interior of the parking areas as the requirements apply to the individual site. The text and diagrams below explain the options that the applicant has for the site. Exemptions from these requirements are addressed in section 56-29. 
(1)  Landscaped street frontage buffer. 
a.  The landscaped street buffer serves two primary purposes: when a parking lot is located adjacent to a public right-of-way, a strip of landscaping helps shield projecting headlights that may impair the vision of passing motorist or pedestrians therefore creating a safer environment; it also provides an aesthetically pleasing transition from the public right of way to private property. 
b.  The site plan for any development, other than those exempt in section 56-29 must show a landscaped street buffer along all public rights-of-way. The applicant may choose among five options illustrated below, choosing one or a combination of several to meet the particular site constraints of the development. 

Option 1: A minimum buffer of ten feet in width, planted with a minimum of one shade tree and seven shrubs per 25 linear feet of street frontage. 

Option 2: Earth berms, at least two and one-half feet higher than the finished elevation of the parking lot, planted with a minimum of one shade tree and three shrubs per 25 linear feet of street frontage, with no set dimension. 

Option 3: A six-foot landscaped street buffer with three feet of fall that includes a minimum of one shade tree and three shrubs per 25 linear feet of street frontage. 

Option 4: A three-foot high wall made of brick, stone, or finished concrete along with five-foot buffer area including one shade tree per 25 linear feet along street frontage. 

Option 5: A landscaped buffer area with existing woodlands maintained in 25-foot strip along the street frontage. 
(2)  Interior parking lot landscaping requirements. 
a.  The parking lot landscaping requirement serves several purposes: it provides necessary green space to give relief to expansive parking areas with nothing but asphalt, and the trees provide shade and serve as windbreaks. Planting islands assist with vehicular circulation. 
b.  The site plan for any development, other than those exempt in section 56-29 must show interior parking lot landscaping. A sliding scale to determine the amount of green area per lot has been included in order for the applicant to include these landscaping requirements as an integral part of the site development. 
Total Area of Parking Lot Area % Total Area of Lot for Interior Planting (excluding building and interior planting islands)(including the street frontage buffer, perimeter strip and the travel lanes) 3,000-49,999 sq. ft. 8 50,000-149,000 sq. ft. 10 150,000 sq. ft. or larger 15  
c.  The diagram in subsection (d) illustrates what areas of the vehicle accommodation area are considered when determining the total area of the parking lot. The square footage of all areas within the parking lot's perimeter are counted, including the planting islands required, curbed areas, corner lots, parking spaces and all interior driveways and aisles except those with no parking spaces located on either side. Landscaped areas outside the parking lot may not be used to meet the interior planting requirement. The total amount of green space for the interior lot is determined by figuring eight percent, ten percent, or 15 percent of the total parking lot area as explained above. 
d.  Planting islands are required as a part of the green space percentage in the interior parking lot area. The diagram below illustrates the parking island dimensions. The dimensions of a parking island must be a minimum of nine feet by 19 feet, the same as a parking space, and must be curbed to protect the landscaping and trees. One parking island required for every 15 parking spaces determined for that use group from the minimum parking standard identified in the use unit section of the zoning ordinance. If 13 or more spaces remain, an additional parking island is required. The planting islands must be evenly spaced among the parking spaces in the lot and serve as vehicular delineators whenever possible. In parking lots over 150,000 square feet, the number of parking islands can be reduced but the total square footage of green space must remain according to the requirements. 


e.  Trees are required to be planted in the interior parking area to offer shading from the heat and sun. One tree per planting island is required for the interior parking area with the balance planted in grass or other vegetation. These trees must be planted within the island and a four-foot clearance should be left for car doors to open from adjacent parking spaces. 
f.  Plant materials at vehicular entrances should be located so as to maintain safe sight distances and protect from vehicular lubricants or fuels. 
(3)  Perimeter landscaping other than street frontage. Perimeter landscaping requirements define parking areas and prevent two adjacent lots from becoming one large expanse of paving. When perimeter landscaping is require, the diagram below illustrates this concept. At minimum, a five-foot landscaped strip is required along the side and rear lot lines of a development with one tree per 25 linear feet required along lot lines. 

a.  The perimeter landscaping requirement does not preclude the need for vehicular access to be provided between lots. 
b.  The ten-foot perimeter strip is required for each development regardless if one is already in place from an adjacent, developed lot. 
c.  No pavement may extend within five feet of the property line on any lot unless it is included with an ingress/egress location. 
(Ord. No. 3306, 3-25-03) 
Sec. 56-32. - Landscape installation. 
(a)  Standards have been established for installation of all plant materials within the city. These requirements must be followed in order to receive approval of the site work and final occupancy or approval of the development. The planning and community development director or other person designated by him has the authority to deny the issuance of a final occupancy permit until landscaping is installed according to the requirements of this chapter and to the satisfaction of the site inspector. 
(b)  Temporary occupancy permits may be issued by the building inspector for weather related delays in the completion of a project. The developer shall deposit with the city clerk a surety bond, letter of credit, or cash for 150 percent of the cost of remaining improvements as approved by the director of the planning and community development division. The builder must request a final inspection and make every attempt to finish the project and provide a time frame for completion that both parties must agree upon.

(Ord. No. 3306, 3-25-03) 
Sec. 56-35. - Enforcement and maintenance. 
(a)  The planning and community development director or a person designated by him has the authority to enforce the requirements of this chapter. Final occupancy permits and/or final plats will be held for those who fail to complete landscaping requirements. Once approved, the applicant is required to guarantee the plants for 24 months or they must be replaced by the owner. The property owner will maintain all trees and vegetation. 
(b)  Temporary occupancy permits may be given to tenants from November 1 to March 1 if inclement weather delays completion of project. These requests must be approved by the planning and community development director. 
(Ord. No. 3306, 3-25-03) 
Sec. 56-36. - Alterative methods of compliance.

(3)  Due to a change of use of an existing site, the required buffer yard is larger than can be provided. 
(4)  Safety considerations require a change. 
    The applicant shall describe in a letter to the planning department which of the requirements set forth in the manual will be met with modifications which project conditions justify using alternatives, and how the proposed measures equal or exceed normal compliance. 
(Ord. No. 3306, 3-25-03) 
Sec. 56-37. - List of recommended trees and shrubs. 
    The following lists indicate plantings which will meet the landscaping requirements of this chapter. The lists are by no means comprehensive and are intended merely to suggest the types of flora which would be appropriate for screening and shading purposes. Plants were selected for inclusion on these list according to four principal criteria: 
(1)  General suitability for the climate and soil conditions for this area, 
(2)  Ease of maintenance, 
(3)  Tolerance of city conditions, 
(4)  Availability from area nurseries. 
    When selecting new plantings for a particular site, a developer should first consider the type of plants which are thriving on or near that site. However, if an introduced species has proven highly effective for screening or shading in this area, it too may be proper selection.

(b)  Description of screens. The following three basic types of screen are hereby established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements set forth above: 
(1)  Opaque screen, type A. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least eight feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wood, masonry, or framed metal wall, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. See examples below. Materials not allowed for screening walls include plywood, scrap lumber, wood pallets, chicken wire, concertina wire, fabric (which includes plastic, tarps, vinyl, or other sheeting or similar material), chain link slats, or fiberglass panels. Fence posts and supports must be installed on the side of the screening wall that faces the lot being screened. Concertina wire is not allowed when screening between residential uses. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. 
(2)  Semi-opaque screen, type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants. 
(3)  Broken screen, type C. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet. The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. The screen may contain deciduous plants.

Sec. 56-39. - Variances. 
    The planning commission may approve variances and, thereby, authorize a property owner and/or developer to depart from the literal requirements of this chapter, where strict enforcement of said requirements would cause undue hardship due to circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and the granting of such variance is demonstrated to be within the spirit and intent of the provisions of this chapter, the planning commission may grant requests for variances of any requirements of this chapter according to the following guidelines: 
(1)  The planning commission may modify such requirements to the extent deemed just and proper so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided that such relief may be granted without detriment to the public interest. 
(2)  When the applicant can show that his or her property was acquired in good faith and where by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property, or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of the piece of property, the strict application of such provisions would prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property, and the planning commission is satisfied that the granting of a variance would alleviate a demonstratable hardship, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant, such variance may be granted; provided that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended purpose of this chapter. 
(3)  The board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing on the proposed variance, after: 
a.  At least seven days' notice of the time, place, and request is made to the public prior to the meeting by being given in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
b.  The planning department will post notice of public hearing sign(s) on said property for which a public hearing has been set at least ten days prior to the hearing indicating the date and time of the hearing. Such signs shall be clearly visible, unobstructed to the passing general public, and posted on or near the front property line. 
c.  The adjacent property owners of the property seeking the variance have been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the public hearing in accordance with the following: 
1.  An affidavit is submitted stating that notice has been given to all adjacent property owners of the property subject to the variance after the application has been accepted and placed on the planning commission agenda. 
2.  The petitioner shall be responsible for providing such notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of such record owner(s) as shown in the records of the assessor's office for the county in which the adjacent property is located. 
3.  The required affidavit and supporting exhibits (mailing receipts, list of adjacent property owners and a copy of the notice) shall be filed with the planning office no later than seven days prior to the meeting date. 
d.  The city has sent notice at least ten days prior to the hearing by way of the Springdale Alert Notification System to all subscribers within a one mile radius from the property who have opted to receive such notices, 
e.  The minutes of the meeting will be a part of the minutes of the entire planning commission meeting. 
    Appeal from decision. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission in granting or denying a variance may appeal the decision to the city council within 30 days of the planning commission's decision by giving notice thereof to the city clerk.

(Ord. No. 3306, 3-25-03) 
Sec. 56-41. - Installation to be as provided in applications, plans and permits. 
    Building permits issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by the building inspector authorize only the arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or construction. Arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, and punishable as provided by section 1-9. Subsequent lawful changes of use shall not be deemed a violation.

(1)  Whenever the building official shall find any sign as defined in this section as abandoned or unsafe, he shall, in accordance with established procedure for legal notices, give the owner, agent or person in control of such sign notice stating the defects thereof. This notice shall require the owner within 30 days to purchase a sign permit and to commence specified repairs or improvements, or to demolish and remove the sign. The building official shall set the time allowed to complete such repairs or removal. If the person to whom such notice and order is addressed cannot be found after diligent search, then such notice and order shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of such person; and a copy of such notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises to which it relates. Such mailing and posting shall be deemed adequate service. 
(2)  Any owner, agent or person in control of such sign who shall fail, neglect or refuse within the stated time to comply with the notice from the building official to repair, rehabilitate or to remove such sign thereof shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalties set out in section 22-7 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(3)  In case the owner, agent or person in control cannot be found within the stated time, or, if such owner, agent or person in control shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the notice to repair, rehabilitate or to remove such sign, the building official shall refer the matter of removing the sign to the city council. If the city council deems the sign unsafe and that it is in the best interest of the city to proceed with the removal of the sign, it shall enact an ordinance ordering the property owner to raze and remove the sign, with work thereon to commence within ten days and be completed within 30 days. If the property owner fails to do so, the mayor or his authorized representative shall cause the sign to be razed and removed. The cost thereof shall be charged against such premises and shall constitute a lien thereon. 
(4)  The amount of the lien may be determined at a hearing before the city council held after 30 days' written notice by certified mail to the owner of the sign if the name and whereabouts of the owner is known. If the name of the owner cannot be determined, then the amount will be determined only after publication of notice of the hearing once a week for four consecutive weeks. The determination of the city council is subject to appeal by the property owner to circuit court. The amount so determined at the hearing, plus a ten percent penalty for collection, shall be certified by the city council by ordinance to the tax collector of the county in which the property is located, to be placed on the tax books as delinquent taxes and collected accordingly. The amount, less three percent thereof, when so collected, shall be paid to the city by the county tax collector. In the alternative, the lien provided for pursuant to this chapter and state law may be enforced in circuit court at any time within 18 months after work has been done.

Sec. 98-62. - Wind-resistance construction specifications. 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind as specified in this section. All bracing systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer lateral forces to the foundations. For signs on buildings, the dead and lateral loads shall be transmitted through the structural frame of the building to the ground in such a manner as not to overstress any of the elements thereof. 
(2)  The overturning moment produced from lateral forces shall in no case exceed two-thirds of the dead-load-resisting moment. Uplift due to overturning shall be adequately resisted by proper anchorage to the ground or to the structural frame of the building. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in the determining of the dead-load-resisting moment. Such earth shall be carefully placed and thoroughly compacted. 
(b)  Windloads. For the purpose of design, wind pressure shall be taken upon the gross area of the vertical projection of all signs and sign structures at not less than 30 pounds per square foot for those portions less than 60 feet above the ground and at not less than 45 pounds per square foot for those portions more than 60 feet above the ground. In calculating wind pressure on curved surfaces, such as cylindrical or spherical signs or sign structures, this pressure shall be assumed to act on six-tenths of the projected area. In all open-frame signs or sign structures, the area used in computing wind pressure shall be 11/2 times the net area of the framing members exposed to the wind. 
(c)  Combined loads. Wind loads need not be combined in the design of signs or sign structures, only that loading producing the larger stresses need be used. Vertical design loads shall be assumed to be acting simultaneously with the wind loads. 
(d)  Allowable stresses. The design of steel, concrete or wood members shall conform to the requirements of Chapters 16-23 of the International Building Code. Loads, both vertical and horizontal, exerted on the soil shall not produce stresses exceeding those specified in Chapter 18, Section 1804.

ARTICLE VI. - STREET NAMES AND ADDRESS NUMBERS 

Sec. 110-131. - Purpose. 
    This article establishes a system for assigning street names and address numbers which will assist the public and private sector in locating individual streets, buildings and places in any easy and logical manner and for the protection of public health and safety of all persons living, working or visiting in the city. 
(Ord. No. 3258, § 1, 11-12-02) 
Sec. 110-132. - Street address map, street name index. 
(a)  The official street address map is a part of this article and is incorporated herein by reference. The map shall identify all named streets, numbering centerlines and block numbering grids which specify address number ranges. A typical section of land shall be divided into 16 blocks, or grids, north/south and east/west. Each grid interval shall be 330 feet, except in nonstandard grids identified on the map. The map shall also have letters at the top and bottom and numbers on the side borders at half-mile intervals, for reference with the official street name index. 
(b)  The official street address map and street name index shall be automatically updated upon final plat approval of any plat or large scale development. Each document shall have a revision block which lists the date and ordinance number of the latest change. 
(Ord. No. 3258, § 1, 11-12-02) 
Sec. 110-133. - Centerlines. 
    Emma Avenue and its extension to the city's east and west planning area boundaries shall be the centerline street for north and south address numbers.

The centerline street immediately south of Emma Avenue shall be Holcomb Street to the intersection of Caudle Avenue, after which the centerline shall become Turner Street and its extension to the southern boundary of the city's planning area. 
(Ord. No. 3258, § 1, 11-12-02) 
Sec. 110-134. - Street names. 
(a)  Street. For the purposes of this article, the word "street" shall mean all roadways, public and private, open for general public travel. Access drives to apartment and commercial complexes shall not be considered as streets and shall not be named as such. 
(b)  East/west, north/south, collector, arterial streets. Streets running east and west shall be identified with the suffix "avenue" with the exception of the major east and west streets that have an interchange intersection with Interstates 540 and those streets running east and west that are built with or modified to contain medians may be designated "parkway". Streets running north and south shall be identified with the suffix "street" with the exception of those streets running north and south that are built with or modified to contain medians may be designated "boulevard". Collector and arterial streets running north/south and west of 40th Street shall be given a numbered designation equal to their grid reference divided by 100. 
(c)  State, federal highways as streets. Streets which are also state or federal highways will be identified by their local street name followed by their state or federal designation in parentheses on the official street name and address reference map, for example, "S. Thompson St. (Ark. 71B)." 
(d)  Cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sac streets which have only one entrance/exit shall not be called "avenue" or "street," but shall have a suffix name such as "cove," "lane," "place" or "terrace" to indicate their dead-end nature. 
(e)  Loop streets. Loop streets are circular or rectangular streets which begin at one point and end at another point along a common street and do not connect to any other streets. The street name suffixes on these streets must not be "street" or "avenue," but shall be "loop," "circle," "court" or other name indicating a closed street layout. 
(f)  Street name index. An official street name index shall be maintained which shall list every named street on the map with an alphanumeric reference to assist users in locating streets on the map. 
(Ord. No. 3258, § 1, 11-12-02; Ord. No. 4169, § 1, 2-12-08; Ord. No. 4525, § 1, 8-9-11) 
Sec. 110-135. - Methods for determining address numbers. 
(a)  Odd, even numbering. Address numbers shall be even on the north and west sides of the street and odd on the east and south sides of the street. One hundred numbers shall be assigned to each identified grid block with the lowest number beginning at a point nearest the grid centerline. Address numbers shall be determined by the number grid in which the property is located. Address numbers for property in central areas with no grid shall be assigned in relation to adjacent addressing. 
(b)  New residential subdivisions, unplatted residential and non-residential buildings. In new residential subdivisions each standard-sized lot shall be given a preassigned street number by the planning office upon final plat approval. Address numbers shall be assigned to large lots relative to their capacity to be divided into two or more minimum sized lots for the minimum width allowed by the zoning district. In commercial areas addresses will be assigned to lots of one acre, or more, as development plans for those lots are approved, prior to building permits being issued. 
(c)  Address numbers for all lots shall be determined by calculation. The distance from the center of the property to the last corner of grid shall be measured to get a location number. The location number is then added to the block number to get the address. If the block number is 1200 and the location number is 43, the address is 1243 or 1244 depending upon which side of the street the building is placed. 
Location No. + (distance corner to property/total block length) 100. Address + block no. + location no. 
In other words, the address is the percent of the total distance into the block plus the block number. 
(d)  Changes in number series. When street intersections are within 120 feet of a grid line, the number series change shall be made at the intersection to be more logical to the public. When a long block faces two blocks divided by a street, the number series on the long block shall change at the intersecting street so that houses facing each other will have compatible addresses. 
(e)  Diagonal and curving streets. Diagonal streets which run 45 degrees or less from a north/south line will be numbered by the north/south grid and those more than 45 degrees from the north/south line will be numbered by the east/west grid. Curving streets will be assigned numbers based upon the grid of their greatest length. For instance, if the beginning is more south than west of the end, then the north/south grid will be used. 
(f)  Loop streets and cul-de-sac. On loop streets and cul-de-sac streets, address numbering shall begin at the entrance nearest the grid centerline and increase to the opposite end as if the street were in a straight line. Block number changes will be made every 330 feet with odd and even numbers remaining on the same side of the street as they began. 
(g)  Apartments: 
(1)  Apartment buildings on public streets or private drives shall be assigned individual addresses. Apartments clustered about a central parking area immediately facing a public street shall also be assigned separate street addresses. 
(2)  When apartments are arranged along a private street, addresses can be assigned from this private street. A sign showing the apartment complex name, with the street address below it, must be posted at the entrance. In these instances a central postal facility for all apartments must be located so it is readily accessible to a mail carrier from the public street serving the complex. 
(3)  Each apartment must be identified on the exterior entrance by number or building letter and number for multiple buildings. The numbers shall be in sequence 1, 2, 3, etc. Apartments in lettered buildings shall have the building letter as part of each apartment number, such as B-210. When units are on multiple floors, ground floor numbers shall be in the 100 series (101, 102, 103), second floor in the 200 series 201, 202, 203), etc. If a common hallway is used for several apartments, the external hallway entrance to each apartment shall contain a list of the apartments served. When addressing townhouses and other buildings containing units separately owned, each address shall be placed on the principal external entryway to the unit. 
(4)  The official address for each apartment shall be the building address followed by the apartment number, for example, "329 Fernway Street, Apt. 8". Addresses for units in apartment buildings not on a public street shall include the public street address and the building number with the apartment designation. The official address for each apartment will be the public street address followed by the building letter, a dash, and the apartment number, for example, "329 Fernway Street, Apt. C-104." 
(h)  Mobile home parks: 
(1)  When trailers are arranged along a private street within mobile home parks, each private street within the mobile home park shall be named and a sign, as required by this Code for other private streets, shall be erected on each private street within the mobile home park. 
(2)  Each mobile home on such private street shall then be identified in numerical sequence as determined by calculation within the grid box. The number shall be placed in a conspicuous place on that part of the trailer closest to the street and all mobile homes within the park shall be marked in the same location of the trailer. Address numbers shall be a minimum of three inches high with block letters and shall be visible from the street. Even numbers shall be assigned to the trailers on the north and west sides of the private street and odd numbers on the east and south sides of the street. All other provisions of section 110-136 on the installation of the numbers and the type of number to be placed upon the mobile home shall be as set out in section 110-136 of this Code. 
(3)  It shall be the requirement of the mobile home park owners, who are registered with the city, to make sure that each private street within the mobile home park is properly named and such name shall be approved in advance by the planning and community development director or his/her designated representative, and it is further the responsibility of the mobile home park operator to make sure that each mobile home is properly addressed and the number posted as set out herein and as set out in section 110-136 of this Code. 
(i)  Commercial/office buildings: 
(1)  Commercial/office buildings on public streets or private streets shall be assigned individual addresses. Commercial/office buildings clustered about a central parking area immediately facing a public street shall also be assigned separate street addresses.

In these instances, a central postal facility for all commercial/office buildings and suites must be located so it is readily accessible to a mail carrier from the public street serving the complex. 
(3)  Each suite/unit in a commercial/office building must be identified on the exterior entrance by number or building letter and number for multiple buildings. The numbers shall be in sequence 1, 2, 3, etc. Suites/Units in lettered buildings shall have the building letter as part of each suite/unit number, such as B-210. When units are on multiple floors, ground floor numbers shall be in the 100 series (101, 102, 103), second floor in the 200 series 201, 202, 203), etc. If a common hallway is used for several suites/units, the external hallway entrance to each commercial/office building shall contain a list of the suites/units served. 
(4)  The official address for each commercial/office suite shall be the building address followed by the suite number, for example, "329 Fernway Street, Suite 1". Addresses for units in commercial/office buildings not on a public street shall include the public street address and the building number with the suite designation.

The subdivider or his representative, who has been designated in writing and who has full authority to make decisions in the subdivider's absence, shall be present to address all questions by the planning commissioners. The planning commission shall approve, approve with conditions, disapprove, or table the preliminary plat. If the preliminary plat is tabled, it will be placed on the agenda of the next planning commission meeting. 
If the subdivider desires to develop only a portion of the total area intended for development, the planning commission shall require preliminary plat approval for the entire area to insure that the purpose and intent of these regulations are compiled with, and a final plat shall be required only for the portions of the total area intended for present development, with additional final plat or plats to be required for other portions of the area as developed. Each phase shall be clearly defined on the preliminary plat. 
The approval of the preliminary plat shall lapse after one year unless construction is on-going and work is actively progressing on the installation of the required improvements. 
d.  Replats: The procedure pertaining to preliminary plats shall also apply to replats, including the requirement of notification of adjacent property owners by the developer. 
(3)  Plans and specifications: After the approval of the preliminary plat but before improvements are started, the subdivider shall submit engineering plans, a final drainage report, and specifications for the streets, grading, and storm drainage improvements including, but not limited to, profiles, specifications, and cross-sections along with grading and storm drainage plans and computations, pursuant to and in compliance with chapter 106, Stormwater Drainage and chapter 107, Physical Alteration of Land, of this Code, as adopted or amended hereafter, to the director of the planning and community development division for review and written approval prior to commencement of improvements.

If serious discrepancies are found, the planning commission may disapprove the final plat and require the improvements to be changed at the subdivider's expense. 
If the final plat is disapproved or approved with conditions, the grounds for disapproval or conditions of approval shall be stated on the records of the planning commission. 
Upon approval, the planning commission shall submit the plat to the city council for approval by ordinance.

(Code 1973, § 30-4; Ord. No. 2469, 4-9-96; Ord. No. 2736, § 2, 4-22-97; Ord. No. 2785, §§ 1-6, 11-25-97; Ord. No. 3011, § 1, 9-12-00; Ord. No. 5028 , § 2, 4-12-16) 
Sec. 112-4.1. - Required off-site improvements. 
(a)  Generally. The developer shall be required to install off-site improvements, where the need for such improvements are created in whole or in part by the proposed development. For purposes of this section, an off-site improvement shall mean any improvement listed in section 112-4 of these regulations, but which is to be installed on property located outside the proposed development. 
Any required off-site improvements shall be installed according to city standards; provided off-site improvements to roads located outside the city's corporate limits but within the city's planning area shall be installed to county standards, with the exception that roads adjacent to the city's corporate limits shall be installed to city standards. The developer shall be required to bear that portion of the cost of off-site improvements which bears a rational connection to the needs created by the development. 
At the time the planning commission grants preliminary plat approval, the planning commission shall determine whether the proposed development creates a need for off-site improvements and the portion of the cost of any needed off-site improvements which the developer shall be required to bear; provided, that portion of the cost of off-site improvements to roads located outside the city's corporate limits but within the city's planning area shall be determined by the county. In determining that portion of the cost of off-site improvements which the developer shall be required to bear, the planning commission shall consider the acreage within the proposed development as a percentage of all the acreage which, when fully developed, will benefit from the off-site improvements; provided, the planning commission may use a different method of measurement if it determines that use of the acreage standard will not result in the developer bearing the portion of the cost which bears a rational connection to the needs created by the development. 
(b)  Delayed improvements. If the planning commission determines that a needed off-site improvement should not or cannot be built until future development occurs, the developer shall pay to the city an amount determined by the planning commission in accordance with the standards prescribed in paragraph (a) above to be the developer's proportionate share of the cost of said off-site improvements as of the date of final plat approval; provided, the developer may, with approval of the city council, guarantee payment of said amount so determined by executing a bill of assurance or surety performance bond as determined by the city council, in a form approved by the city attorney; said bill of assurance shall be filed of record and shall be a covenant running with the land; said bill assurance, or surety performance bond, shall provide for payment of interest on said amount at the maximum legal rate, and shall obligate the landowner to pay to the city the amount so determined by the planning commission within ten days from receipt of written notice from the city. The city shall deposit said money into an interest-bearing escrow account until such time as the off-site improvement is constructed. If the off-site improvement is not constructed within five years from the date of the first payment into the escrow account or guarantee of this payment by a bill of assurance or surety performance bond by a developer, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing after notification to all affected property owners. Following the public hearing, the planning commission may: 
(1)  Determine that the off-site improvement is still necessary and feasible and can be built within a reasonable time; in which case, the escrow account or guarantee shall be continued for a period specified by the planning commission; or 
(2)  Determine that the off-site improvement is not necessary, or will not be feasible, or that insufficient development has occurred to render the improvement likely in the foreseeable future; in which case, the planning commission shall recommend that the city distribute such funds as follows: 
a.  Refund the money in the escrow account, with accumulated interest, to the existing property owner(s) on a pro rata basis; or 
b.  Release the developer(s) and/or property owner(s) from the obligation to provide a guarantee by a bill of assurance or surety performance bond in lieu of payment into the escrow account. 
(c)  Determining necessity for off-site improvements. 
(1)  When a proposed development has access to paved streets or roads only by way of substandard or unimproved roads or street leading from the development to the paved streets or roads, the developer shall be responsible for contributing his proportionate share of the cost of improving the substandard access roads or streets to existing city or county standards. The developer's proportionate share of said costs shall be determined by the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above. 
(2)  When a proposed development has direct access to, or fronts on, an existing road or street which is below current standards, the developer shall be responsible for contributing his proportionate share of the cost of improving said street or road to existing city or county standards. The planning commission shall determine the developer's proportionate share of said costs in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above. 
(3)  Off-site drainage improvements shall be required whenever a proposed development causes the need for such improvements in accordance with section 106-6 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(Code 1973, § 30-4.1; Ord. No. 3435, § 1, 1-13-04) 
Sec. 112-5. - Optional improvements. 
    Generally, developers may install improvements on the property being developed beyond those required by this Code at their option, so long as such do not conflict with any requirements of this Code or any local, state or federal regulations, and are approved by the planning commission. The city encourages greenspace and open space and efforts to plant and beautify such space; however, the city is not responsible for maintaining such greenspace or open space. The city requires that all such open space or greenspace be platted as common open space, and that the developer provide to the city, at the time of preliminary plat submission: 
(1)  A plan of the proposed greenspace or open space including all proposed signs, plantings and improvements; and 
(2)  A proposed property owners' association agreement governing financial and physical maintenance of any such common open space. 
The planning commission may approve such plans on a case-by-case basis and shall have the power to require modifications to the property owners' association agreement. Any signs located in such open space shall be maintained as a part of the common open space for which the property owners' association will be permanently responsible.

The private drive contained in the access easement shall be paved in its entirety. There shall be five feet between the back of the curb on each side of the paved drive and the outside boundary of the easement. All tandem lot owners shall be responsible for maintaining the access easement so that all vehicles have safe access to the structure located on the lot. The tandem lot owners shall have title to, or a perpetual easement for the access easement. 
(4)  The safety zone between the access easement of the tandem lot and any adjacent driveway will not be less than the minimum distance between curb cuts as specified in Article 5, Section 1, (H) of Chapter 130 (Zoning Ordinance) of the Springdale Code of Ordinances, off-site parking requirements.

Lot area calculations to determine whether a tandem lot meets minimum lot area requirements shall not include any portions of the lot having less than the required minimum width. No structure shall be placed on any portion of a tandem lot having less than the required minimum width. 
    After a tandem lot is approved, the applicant shall comply with the provisions of section 112-3(d), informal plat. 
(Ord. No. 2185, § I, 5-11-93; Ord. No. 2307, § I, 7-12-94; Ord. No. 2744, § 2, 5-13-97; Ord. No. 3011, § 1, 9-12-00) 
Sec. 112-11. - Variances and waivers. 
    The planning commission may approve subdivision and large-scale development variances and, thereby, authorize a property owner to depart from the literal requirements of this chapter, or any other requirements of this Code applicable to subdivisions or large-scale developments, in utilization of his or her property, in cases where undue hardship results from literal enforcement. In situations where a variance is inappropriate, a property owner or his agent may petition the planning commission for a waiver of any provision of this chapter, in whole or in part, upon a sufficient showing of grounds therefor. 
(1)  Variances. In instances where strict enforcement of said requirements would cause undue hardship due to circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and the granting of such variance is demonstrated to be within the spirit and intent of the provisions of this chapter, the planning commission may grant requests for variances of any requirements of this chapter, the zoning ordinance, or any other requirements of this Code applicable to subdivisions or large-scale developments, governing subdivisions and large-scale developments according to the following guidelines: 
a.  The planning commission may modify such requirements to the extent deemed just and proper so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided that such relief may be granted without detriment to the public interest. 
b.  When the applicant can show that his or her property was acquired in good faith and where by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property, or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of the piece of property, the strict application of such provisions would prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property, and the planning commission is satisfied that the granting of a variance would alleviate a demonstratable hardship, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant, such variance may be granted; provided that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended purpose of this chapter. 
(2)  Waivers. A waiver from any of said requirements may be granted by the planning commission when: 
a.  A bill of assurance is given as set forth in section 112-11(4) herein; 
b.  A payment in lieu of improvements is made pursuant to section 112-6(b); 
c.  The conditions governing variances set forth in [subsection] (1)b. above are met, subject to city council approval on street improvements, drainage, curbs, gutters and sidewalks, as hereinafter set out; 
d.  The planning commission determines that certain improvements or requirements are not necessary for the public interest or are inappropriate because connecting facilities on nearby or adjacent property are inadequate or lacking. 
The planning commission may waive such improvements or requirements when to do so would be consistent with the spirit, intent and purpose of this chapter. Provided, however, that any waivers pertaining to street improvements, drainage relating thereto, curbs, gutters, or sidewalks shall be first heard by the planning commission and a recommendation made to the city council, but only the city council may grant a waiver for street improvements, drainage relating thereto, curbs, gutters, or sidewalks. However, no city council approval is required if a bill of assurance or payment in lieu of improvements is given and approved by the planning commission. 
(3)  Waivers of off-site improvements. A showing of one or more of the following shall be sufficient grounds for a property owner to be granted a waiver of an off-site improvement requirement: 
a.  The city or county has no plans, and anticipates no plans in the foreseeable future, for upgrading the substandard street or road on which improvements are proposed to be required by the developer. 
b.  The proposed development has primary access to improved streets and roads, and the portion of the development which fronts on a substandard street or road is so small or remote from anticipated future traffic patterns as to cause an unfair imposition on the developer. 
c.  The property owner or his agent proposes alternative improvements which will protect the health, safety and welfare of persons in the proposed development and the surrounding area and will equally benefit said persons. 
d.  The property owner or his agent does not propose access to the proposed development from an existing substandard street or road and proposes to provide access by way of streets or roads improved to current city or county standards. 
(4)  Bill of assurances or performance bond. A bill of assurances to the city may be required from the property owner prior to any variance or waiver being granted, which shall run with the land and shall set a fixed period of time in which the varied or waived requirement must be provided by the property owner. In the alternative, the city may require the posting of a performance bond as set forth hereinabove in section 112-6(1) for the completion of such requirements in a time period to be fixed by the planning commission or the city council. 
(5)  Appeal from decision. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission in granting or denying a variance or waiver may appeal the decision to the city council within 30 days of the planning commission's decision by giving notice thereof to the city clerk.

Subject to section 114-58, no parking, displaying, or storing of any motor vehicle shall be permitted on any grass surface, gravel surface, or other unpaved area in any residential zone, or in any platted subdivision zoned agricultural on lots less than one acre in size, except that: 
(1)  One parking space may be located on the grass in a required front set back adjacent to and parallel to the current driveway located on the property. The size of such parking space shall not exceed 9' × 19'. Access to such parking space shall be by way of the property's driveway, not by driving over the curb, and shall be located on the opposite side of the driveway from the primary entrance to the residential structure. If the parking space is not maintained with adequate grasses to keep the area from becoming rutted, muddy and/or soil from being blown or washed away, such parking area shall be paved by the property owner by obtaining an expanded parking permit 
(2)  An expanded parking permit may be obtained to expand an existing driveway. The expansion must be in a required front set back adjacent to and parallel to the current driveway located on the property, where geographic conditions are favorable. The expansion shall be located on the opposite side of the driveway from the primary entrance to the residential structure, and shall be constructed in accordance with the City of Springdale "Residential Driveway Detail". Provided, however, that the maximum allowed paved surface area shall not exceed 40 percent of the total area of the front yard. The expanded parking permit shall be obtained from the Springdale Public Works Department by the owner of the property on which the expanded parking is sought, and shall include inspections of the driveway expansion area by the Springdale Public Works Department before and after installation of the expanded parking area. The expanded parking permit shall cost $10.00 upon application of the permit in conjunction with a curb cut permit which is also obtained at the Springdale Public Works Department. No curb cut will be required if the expanded parking area can be accessed by way of an existing driveway without driving over the curb. All expanded parking areas shall be concrete, unless the existing driveway is asphalt, in which case the expanded parking area shall consist of asphalt. 
(c)  Storage or parking of motor vehicles. The storage or parking of motor vehicles in any side yard or rear/back yard of property in any residential zone, or in any platted subdivision zoned agricultural on lots less than one acre in size, shall be prohibited, unless the property has a detached garage located in the side or rear year used for the parking of a motor vehicle. 
(d)  Unpaved driveways. Properties on which an unpaved driveway existed as of the date of the passage of this section would not be required to pave, but would be subject to all other restrictions contained herein.

(e)  Variances. In instances where strict enforcement of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) would cause undue hardship due to circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and the granting of such variance is demonstrated to be within the spirit and intent of the provisions of this chapter, the planning commission may grant requests for variances of the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) according to the following guidelines: 
(1)  The planning commission may modify such requirements to the extent deemed just and proper so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided that such relief may be granted without detriment to the public interest. 
(2)  When the applicant can show the property was acquired in good faith and where by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property, or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of the piece of property, the strict application of such provisions would prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property, and the planning commission is satisfied that the granting of a variance would alleviate a clear hardship, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant, such variance may be granted; provided that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended purpose of this chapter. 
(3)  Bill of assurances or performance bond. A bill of assurance to the city may be required from the property owner prior to any variance being granted, which shall run with the land and shall set a fixed period of time in which the varied requirement must be provided by the property owner. 
(4)  Any party aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission in granting or denying a variance may appeal the decision to the city council within 30 days of the planning commission's decision by giving notice thereof to the city clerk. 
(f)  Exception. The prohibitions set out herein do not apply to the following: 
(1)  Commercial vehicles or construction equipment during the actual performance of a temporary service on the property where it is parked. 
(2)  A vehicle making a bona fide pickup or delivery of property or merchandise.

(3)  To provide for penalties for violations of the regulations established herein. 
(b)  Applicability. This code shall apply to all users of water provided by the city.

(1)  The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts, the municipal system and the user's system. 
(2)  The municipal system shall consist of the source facilities and the distributions system, and shall include all those municipal facilities of the water system, under the complete control of the city water commission, up to the point where the user's system begins. 
(3)  The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system.

(Ord. No. 3161, §§ 1, 2, 10-23-01) 
Sec. 118-128. - Backflow prevention. 
(a)  Responsibility. The city water commission is hereby authorized to implement and administer a cross-connection and backflow prevention program to protect potable water supplied in the municipal system of the city. By virtue of this authority, the city water commission and its authorized agents shall become the administrative authority responsible for the implementation and administration of a cross-connection and backflow prevention program for the city. The administrative authority is further authorized and delegated the responsibility to enforce provisions contained in this division and future amendments hereto. 
(b)  Enforcement. If, in the judgement of the administrative authority, an approved backflow prevention device is required to protect the quality of potable water supplied in the municipal system from nonpotable sources in the user's water system, the water user shall be given written notice to install an approved backflow prevention device or devices at one or more specified locations in the user's water system. The water user shall be required to immediately install such approved backflow device(s) at one or more specified locations at the water user's expense. Failure, refusal, or inability of the water user to install, have tested, and maintain said backflow prevention devices shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service until such requirements have been adequately satisfied. 
(c)  Policy. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the city water commission unless the water supply is protected as required by federal and state laws and regulations, and provisions of this code. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the city water commission if a backflow-prevention assembly required by this division is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Services will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. 
(1)  Inspection. The user's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the administrative authority to determine the existence of cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of this division. When such a condition becomes known, the city water commission shall have the authority to deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the user has corrected the condition or conditions in conformance with federal and state statutes and regulations, city ordinances, standards relating to plumbing and water supplied and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
(2)  Auxiliary water supply. Municipal water service shall not be provided to any premises when the user's water system is interconnected to an auxiliary water supply. When such a condition becomes known, the city water commission shall have the authority to deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises until such time the user has installed an approved air-gap separation to provide a physical break between the user's auxiliary water supply and the municipal water system. An air-gap separation shall be the only acceptable means to protect the backflow of auxiliary water through the service connection to the municipal water system, thereby limiting the degree of hazard that exists. 
(3)  Type of backflow-prevention assembly required. An approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a user's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist: 
a.  In the case of premises on which any industrial fluid systems or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the municipal water system, the municipal water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process water and waters originating from the municipal water system that have been subject to deterioration in quality. 
b.  In the case of premises having (1) internal cross connection that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impractical or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the municipal water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line. 
(4)  Type of backflow-prevention assembly required. The type of backflow-prevention assembly required under subsection (3) shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows: 
a.  In the case of premises where there are water and/or substance(s) that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the municipal water system, the municipal water system shall be protected against backflow by an approved double check valve assembly. 
b.  In the case of premises where there is material danger to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the municipal water system, the municipal water system shall be protected against backflow by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure backflow-prevention assembly. Examples of premises where such conditions exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, and metalplating facilities. 
c.  In the case of premises where there are cross connections, either actual or potential, the municipal water system shall be protected against backflow by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly at the service connection. 
d.  In the case of premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the municipal water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure backflow-prevention assembly on each service connection to the premises. 
e.  In the case of premises where, in the opinion of the administrative authority, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the administrative authority may require an air-gap at the service connection to protect the municipal water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the administrative authority and is dependent on the degree of hazard. 
(5)  Approved backflow-prevention assembly. Any backflow-prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the administrative authority. The term "approved backflow-prevention assembly" shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association and approved by the state department of health. 
(6)  Certified inspections and operational tests. It shall be the duty of the user at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year, and the unit overhauled at least every five years. In those instances where the administrative authority deems the hazard great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections are tests that shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative or by a certified tester approved by the state department of health. It shall be the duty of the water user to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The user shall notify the administrative authority in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that representatives of the administrative authority may witness these tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the water user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such certified tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept for no less than five years, and a copy submitted to the administrative authority within ten working days of the tests or repairs. 
(7)  Notification. It shall be the duty of the water user at any premises being provided water service by the city water commission to notify the administrative authority of the installation of a new backflow-prevention assembly. Certified inspections and operational tests shall be made within ten working days of the date the new backflow-prevention assembly is placed into operation. The installation of all new backflow-prevention assemblies shall be inspected and their operation tested by the assembly manufacturer's representative, or by a certified tester approved by the state department of health. All fees and expenses for tests and inspections shall be at the expense of the water user. 
(8)  Exclusion from requirements. All presently installed backflow-prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this division but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (6), be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the administrative authority is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the municipal water system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the administrative authority finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this division. 
(9)  Annual fee. The administrative authority is hereby authorized to collect an annual fee from each user of water maintaining a backflow-prevention assembly. The annual fees collected shall be used to offset the cost of establishing and maintaining a record system to permit and track backflow-prevention assemblies and their annual certification. The annual permit fee collected by the administrative authority shall not exceed the sum of ten dollars for each backflow-prevention assembly maintained by each user of water.

In addition, the board is responsible for hearing requests for variances from the literal provisions of this chapter in instances where strict enforcement of this chapter would cause undue hardship due to circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that such action will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of the provisions of this chapter. The board of zoning adjustment shall not permit, as a variance, any use in a zone that is not permitted under this chapter.

(2)  Variances. 
(a)  The board may grant upon application in specific cases such variances from the bulk or area regulations of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the board unless and until: 
1.  A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or building in the same district. 
b.  That literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter. 
c.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
d.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
e.  No nonconforming use of adjacent lands, structures, or buildings in the same district, and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
2.  The public hearing shall be held and public notice shall be given as set forth in subsection b. above. 
a.  To grant a variance the board must find that the requirements of subsection d.(2)(a)1. have been met by the applicant for a variance.

c.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
3.  In granting any variance, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
4.  Under no circumstances shall the board grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by terms of this chapter is said district. 
5.  Under no circumstances shall the action of the board be considered to grant a variance of any provision of any other protective code adopted by the city. 
(b)  The board may grant, as a hardship variance, relief to any property owner who has a vested interest in a previously devised plan which conformed to the chapter in effect prior to the passage of this chapter. The owner must show proof of the previous intent including, but not limited to, development plans and specifications for that specific site. The board will not allow as a part of this process any use in any zone which is not allowed within that zone. 
e.  Appeals. Any persons or person, or any board, taxpayer, department, or board of the city aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment may seek review by a court of record of such decision, in the manner provided by the laws of the state. 
f.  Duties of planning and community development director, board of adjustment, city council and courts on matters on appeal.

3.  A brief statement explaining the reason for the rezoning request, the intended use of the property, and the effect of property changes upon the surrounding land uses. 
4.  A layman's description of the property. 
5.  If the property to be rezoned is to be only a portion of the land described on the warranty deed then an accurate legal description provided by a copy of a recent survey certified by a registered land surveyor will be required. 
6.  A scaled drawing of the property to be rezoned showing accurate lot lines, surrounding zoning, adjacent property owners names, vicinity map, and a north arrow. 
7.  Evidence in the form of a signed affidavit, that notice has been given to all adjacent property owners of the project subject to the rezoning after the application has been accepted and placed on the planning commission agenda. The petitioner shall be responsible for providing such notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of such record owner(s) as certified by a licensed abstractor or a licensed land surveyor within the past sixty (60) days. 
8.  The required affidavit and supporting exhibits (mailing receipts, list of adjacent property owners and copy of notice) shall be filed with the planning office no later than seven (7) days prior to the meeting date. 
c.  Public hearing. Upon receipt of a petition for an amendment, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment, after: 
1.  A notice which sets forth the time and place of such hearing and the amendment proposal has been: 
(a)  Published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least one time fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing; and 
(b)  Sent by the City, at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, by way of the Springdale Alert Notification System to all subscribers within a one (1) mile radius from the property who have opted to receive such notices. 
2.  The Planning Department will post NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING sign(s) on said property for which a public hearing has been set at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing indicating the date and time of the hearing. Such sign(s) shall be clearly visible, unobstructed to the passing general public, and posted on or near the front property line.

Any decisions made by the designated agent shall be binding on the landowner. 
d.  Action by the planning commission. 
1.  The planning commission shall hear the petitioner's request for rezoning at the public hearing and shall consider the petitioner's purposes for the re-zoning request as well as public comments. The amendment, as presented or modified by the action following the public hearing, shall be voted on by the planning commission or tabled for further action. If recommendation for approval is granted by the planning commission, the matter will be referred to the city council in the form of an ordinance, (ordinance to be prepared by staff), for the approval of the city council. 
2.  Should the planning commission determine a lesser impacting zone would be more appropriate to meet the purposes of the petitioner and would cause less impact on the neighboring parties, the commission is empowered to reduce the zoning classification requested to a different classification, if the petitioner concurs. After consideration of comments from the public, the commission may vote thereon without the necessity of further publication notice. Any change in zoning classification to a higher or more impacting zone would require notice be republished and a public hearing to be held again. 
3.  The petitioner's request for rezoning may be tabled one time to a later meeting only by action of the planning commission and only after the commission has heard comments from adjacent property owners and interested parties. Tabling a petition one time by the planning commission will not require an additional filing fee or re-notification. Should the petition be tabled again, it will be treated as a withdrawal of the rezoning request, and will require the refilling of the petition complete with an additional filing fee and proper re-notifications before the matter will be placed on the agenda. 
4.  If a petitioner would like to withdraw a request, the petitioner may do so at the public hearing or in writing prior to the meeting. Withdrawal by a petitioner will require the refiling of the application complete with an additional filing fee and proper re-notifications before the matter will be placed on the agenda. 
e.  Action by the city council. The city council, by majority vote, may by ordinance adopt the recommended amendment submitted by the planning commission or may return the proposed amendment to the planning commission for further study and recommendation. If action is not taken by the city council within sixty (60) days of the planning commission's submission of the proposed amendment to the city council, then the applicant shall be required to re-petition for a zoning change. 
f.  Appeal by petition to the city council. Following disapproval of a proposed amendment by the planning commission, the petitioner may appeal such disapproval to the city council, provided that the petitioner states specifically in writing to the city clerk why the petitioner considers the planning commission's findings and decisions to be in error. Such appeal shall be filed with the city clerk within fifteen (15) days from the date of the planning commission action along with an affidavit stating that adjacent property owners have been notified of the appeal to the city council. The appeal will be placed on the city council agenda no later than the second meeting following the filing of the appeal. The petitioner shall be present at the meeting for the matter to be considered. If the petitioner is unable to attend, written authorization from the petitioner authorizing representation must be presented to the council for the matter to be considered. The city council may approve the proposed amendment only by majority vote of all the members. 
g.  Re-petitions for amendment. No zoning amendment for a specific zone change which was denied shall be resubmitted within twelve (12) months from the date of final disapproval of a proposed amendment unless there is evidence submitted to the planning commission which justifies reconsideration. 
    11.2 Amendment procedures initiated by the city council. When the city council desires to initiate amendments to the ordinance, such proposals shall be referred to the planning commission for study and recommendations. Following public hearings as provided in section 11.1 c., the planning commission and the city council shall act in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 11.1 d. and e. 
    11.3 Amendment procedures for the planning commission. When the planning commission desires to initiate an amendment to this article, it shall pass a resolution by a majority vote of the planning commission detailing the proposed amendment. Said resolution shall be filed with the city clerk, and a public hearing shall be called by the planning commission as provided in section 11.1 c. above. Following such public hearing, the planning commission and the city council shall act in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 11.1 d. and e. above. 
(Ord. No. 3307, 3-25-03; Ord. No. 3373, § 1, 9-9-03; Ord. No. 3865, § 1, 4-11-06; Ord. No. 4419, § 1, 6-8-10; Ord. No. 4870, § 1, 12-9-14) 
Sec. 12. - Conditional uses on appeal to planning commission. 
    The planning commission shall hear at a scheduled public hearing only such conditional use as is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of article 4 of this chapter; shall decide such questions as are involved in determining whether such conditional uses shall be recommended for approval to the city council; and shall recommend approval, modify or deny conditional uses at its discretion with the conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this ordinance. Approval of a conditional use shall not be granted as a matter of right, but shall be granted only in situations where said use is in harmony with the character of the neighborhood and zone in which it shall be located and the structure in which it is to operate meets building and fire codes as adopted by the city. Once a conditional use is approved that conditional use is personal to the applicant and is limited to the location to which it was approved and may only be changed to another conditional use through further action of the planning commission and the city council. Once a conditional use is approved that use may continue so long as it abides by the findings of this subsection and any special conditions placed upon the use by the planning commission and the city council. 
    If a complaint is filed with the planning commission by an adjoining property owner or city employee concerning an alleged violation of a conditional use, the planning commission shall notify the property owner of the complaint and schedule a public hearing. If after the public hearing the planning commission finds a violation to exist and that violation is not corrected within thirty (30) days, the planning commission may vote to discontinue the conditional use. The property owner shall be notified of the action of the planning commission and shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice to discontinue the use or file and appeal with the city council. The filing of an appeal stays all proceeding and the city council shall make the final determination. 
    A conditional use may be changed to a use by right in the zoning district upon approval by the planning commission and the city council. The conditional use application shall indicate that the applicant is requesting that the conditional use be made a use by right on the subject property and the planning commission shall recommend approval, modify or deny the use by right at its discretion with the conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this section. 
    Under no circumstances shall any action of the planning commission or city council be considered as the granting of a variance of any provision of any other protective code adopted by the city. 
    The following procedures shall be followed before a conditional use may be granted: 
a.  Written application. A written application for a conditional use shall be submitted to the planning director with a fee, as determined by resolution of the city council, to recover costs of public notices and other expenses, and shall contain the following information:

Sec. 4. - Industrial districts. 
4.1  General purpose. The industrial zoning districts are intended to provide for the development of light to heavy industrial uses and their related facilities. Appropriate standards for the various districts are designed to assure compatibility with other similar uses. In the city, such factors as location, availability of transportation, utilities and other factors have combined to create a well-established industrial base. In order to maintain quality industrial development and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public the specifics purposes of industrial districts are: 
1.  To provide sufficient space, at appropriate locations, to meet the needs of the city's projected requirements for all types of distributive, industrial and related activities, with due allowance for the need for choice of suitable sites. 
2.  To protect distributive, industrial and related activities, as well as residential and related activities by providing for the separation of these uses; to ensure that appropriate space needs for distributive and industrial activities are available or prohibiting the use of space for residential purposes. 
3.  To protect industrial activities and related developments against congestion, as appropriate for each area, by limiting the bulk of buildings in relation to the land around them and to one another, and by requiring off-street parking and loading facilities to be provided with such developments. 
Unless otherwise specifically provided in this section, the following restrictions shall apply to all the industrial districts: 
(1)  Any lighting visible from outside the site shall be designed to reflect away from adjacent residential districts. No noise, odor or vibration shall be emitted so that it constitutes a nuisance which substantially exceeds the general level of noise, odor or vibration emitted by uses adjacent to or immediately surrounding the site. Such comparisons shall be made at the boundaries of the site. 
(2)  Outdoor storage of trash receptacles shall be at the sides or rear of the site and shall be totally encircled or screened by a fence, planting or other suitable visual barrier. 
4.2  W-1-Warehouse district.

PURPOSE. 
    The I-3 planned industrial district is established in order to provide for modern, efficient, and well-designed industrial facilities within a "park-like" setting. As the city's most restrictive industrial district, the I-3 zone is designed to conform to high development standards while providing for a full array of industrial and related uses. The siting of buildings, parking, landscaping and the location of this district in relation to adjacent residential and commercial areas will be of particular importance in determining the appropriateness of allowing the I-3 district at a given location.

Sec. 5. - Special districts. 
5.1  PUD-Planned unit development district. 
PURPOSE. 
    The planned unit development district is established to permit the subdivision of land and zoning review into one process. The combination review permits a development proposal to be acted upon simultaneously by the developer and the city. This system is advantageous when the developer that plats the land and provides access and utilities also provides the amenities that make the overall project marketable. An additional advantage is that the approved PUD plan remains intact even if transfer in ownership occurs. The approved PUD plan represents a commitment by both the developer and the city. 
    The PUD process permits more flexibility in the choice of building types, the arrangement of varied land uses, and the use of generalized rather than specific development regulation. By permitting and encouraging the use of such procedures the planning commission and the city council will be able to make more informed land use decisions and thereby guide development more effectively in the best interest of the city. The PUD should: 
(1)  Facilitate and encourage a maximum of social and community interactions and activity among those who live, shop, play and work there. 
(2)  Provide open space not only for traditional private use in setbacks and yards surrounding structures, but also conveniently located with respect to points of residential and commercial concentration for the general benefit of the community and public as places for relaxation, recreation and social activity. 
(3)  Provide a comprehensive, multi-modal circulation system separated from vehicular roadways which links residential, non-residential and open space areas 
(4)  Preserve the natural environment by minimizing the grading necessary for construction. 
(5)  Achieve a maximum of safety, convenience and amenity for both the residents of the PUD and the residents of neighboring areas and assure compatibility with existing and proposed surrounding land uses. 
    The development plan may be submitted in conjunction with the rezoning of the site or prior to the development of the site.

SITE PLAN REVIEW. 
    When a proposal is made to develop a planned unit development, a PUD site plan review shall be required. See article 6, section 5 of this chapter for the planned unit development application review procedure. 
DENSITY, BULK, AREA AND YARD REGULATIONS. 
    Density. PUD densities may be determined on the basis of any and all of the following considerations; the densities designated by the land use plan, the densities of surrounding development, the densities allowed under the various zoning districts, the urban development goals and other policies of the city, topography and character of the natural environment and the impact of a given density on the specific site and adjacent properties. The city also has the discretion to consider any other relevant factors. 
    Lot size. There shall be no minimum standards for lot size although existing standards of zoning and subdivision regulations may be used as a guide. 
    Setback. There shall be no minimum standard although existing standards of the zoning and subdivision regulations will be used as a guide. 
OFF-STREET PARKING. 
    See article 7 of this chapter. 
ENCLOSURE OF USES.

In addition, outdoor display of merchandise is allowed in an area equal to one-half (1/2) of the facade area of the front of the building as long as said display of merchandise is stored inside the building or other completely enclosed structure after normal working hours. 
SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING. 
    In order to enhance the integrity and attractiveness of the development, and when deemed necessary to protect adjacent properties, the planning commission shall require landscaping and screening as part of a PUD. The nature and extent of screening and landscaping shall be determined by the planning commission in relation to the overall character of the development and its specific location. The required screening shall be submitted to the planning commission as part of the final development plan. Landscape plans shall show the general location, type and quality (size/age) of plant material. Screening plans shall include typical details of fences, berms and plant material to be used.

This district is designed to protect the lives and property of persons living in such vicinity; protect public health, safety and welfare; and to reduce the burden on the city and its inhabitants and property owners by eliminating or reducing the need for the construction of flood control channels, dams, levies and other flood control improvements that would be required if scattered and unplanned development is permitted to occur. 
    The floodplain areas within the jurisdiction of the city are hereby defined as those identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study, Washington County, Arkansas and Incorporated Areas" dated December 20, 2000 with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary-floodway maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. 
INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. 
    The boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be determined from the aforementioned flood hazard boundary maps as digitized and placed on the city's Geographic Information System. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district shown on the flood hazard boundary map, the certified flood plain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be the governing factor in locating a district boundary on any property. Appeals from the administrative judgment of the staff shall be filed with the planning commission serving as the board of adjustment. The content of the filing shall consist of a cover letter addressed to the chairman and members of the board setting forth the request and a copy of all pertinent graphic materials or correspondence. This filing shall occur within thirty (30) calendar days of the action by staff. The board shall accept the engineering data of a registered professional engineer unless conflicting engineering data is proved to be correct. 
OVERLAY ZONE. 
    The FP floodplain district will be used as an overlay zone and this zoning classification is superimposed on any existing zoning classification. The bulk and area requirements of the base zoning classification shall be applied to buildings within an overlay of FP floodplain zoning. 
PERMITTED USES. 
1.  Within the floodplain (one-hundred year flood elevation) there exists an area of the channel or streambed called the floodway and so designated on the city's flood boundary-floodway maps (FBFM). No building or structure shall be allowed within the floodway. 
2.  In order to build or operate any structure or use, it must be an allowable use among those specified as allowable uses in the base or principal zoning classification; provided further no such use shall adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any designated creek, stream, tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch, or other drainage facility or system; and provided still further, no such use or combination of uses shall raise the level of the one-hundred-year flood a distance of one (1) foot. 
PROHIBITED USES. 
    In the floodplain district, the storage or processing, above ground, and the storage, below ground of materials or fuel which is flammable or explosive or which could otherwise be injurious to human, animal or plant life in time of flood shall be unlawful. 
5.4  Airport overlay district. 
    The Airport Overlay District regulations are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter as if fully set out herein. A copy of the regulations, as amended, will be permanently kept on file and available for public review in the office of the city clerk.

A further purpose of the preapplication conference is to make sure that the applicant has, or will be able to, submit the necessary information for filing the application. The intent of this conference is to provide guidance to the applicant prior to incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys and other data required in a preliminary plan. 
3.  Preliminary development plan review. An application seeking a PUD rezoning of a parcel of property shall submit to the planning and community development division a preliminary plan and all the necessary fees at the time of the filing.

A public hearing for the preliminary plan shall be set no later than sixty (60) days after filing and shall be legally advertised as specified in the zoning ordinance. 
At the public hearing before the planning commission, the applicant and interested citizens will have the opportunity to discuss the merits of the development proposal. The planning commission will assess the proposal in light of ordinance guidelines and will take action after weighing the recommendations of staff, the developer's presentation and the community response. The commission shall approve, grant approval with conditions on specified modifications, or disapprove the development proposal. The applicant shall receive written notification of the action taken by the planning commission within ten (10) days of the meeting date. 
If the planning commission approves the preliminary plan, it will be forwarded to the city council for their review. The city council may grant or deny as submitted or as amended, defer for requested changes or information, or return the application to the planning commission for further study. The council may direct the planning commission to reconsider specific aspects of the preliminary plan. If the preliminary plan is approved, an ordinance shall be prepared which incorporates the plan or conditions. The city shall not issue any building or occupancy permits until the specified conditions or modifications are met. 
If a preliminary plan is conditionally approved, the applicant shall have ninety (90) days from the date of planning commission action granting approval to submit a revised preliminary plan. If the planning staff determines such revisions are in conformance with the planning commission's specific recommendations, it shall be forwarded to the city council for disposition.

5.  Final development plan and plat. The applicant shall generally have one year from the date of preliminary development plan and plat approval to submit the final development plan and plat. In cases where a phased preliminary development plan is approved, an approved submission schedule for incremental final development plan and plat shall be followed. Requests for extensions shall be submitted in writing to the planning commission, which shall not unreasonably withhold approval. A maximum of two (2) one-year extensions may be granted by the planning commission. Additional extensions shall require approval by the city council. Extensions must be applied for before the time elapses on preliminary approvals. 
The final development plan and plat review shall be conducted by the planning commission and staff. They will review the final development plan and plat to determine that no substantial changes were made to those elements of the plan agreed upon in the preliminary development plan. If substantial changes are found to have been made to the agreed elements, then the application must be resubmitted for preliminary development plan review. 
The final development plan shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the preliminary development plan provided the plan does not: 
a.  Increase proposed floor area for nonresidential use by more than five (5) percent. 
b.  Increase total building coverage by more than five (5) percent. 
c.  Increase total number of dwelling units by more than five (5) percent within a given phase. Fluctuation shall be permissible, provided overall density is maintained.

Approval or disapproval of a final development plan and plat by the planning commission shall occur within sixty (60) days of the filing of the plan and plat. If the plan as submitted contains deviations of substance from the previously approved preliminary development plan the planning commission may, after meeting with the landowner, refuse to grant final approval and shall so advise the landowner of said refusal, giving the reasons such deviations are not in the public interest. 
The landowner may either submit a final development plan and plat in conformance with the preliminary plan or file a written appeal with the city council within thirty (30) days of the refusal date. The city council shall consider the appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
Before the final development plan and plat has been approved, the applicant shall assure installation of required public improvements as required for final plat approval in the city subdivision regulations.

5.5  Modification of plan and plat. If, after the development of the PUD has commenced, it becomes either impossible or unconscionable for the applicant to adhere to the approved plan and plat, a modified plan and plat, consistent in intent, can be submitted to the planning commission for public hearing, with notice to adjacent property owners, and the city council for final approval. The modified plan and plat may be substituted for the original plan and plat upon approval by both the planning commission and the city council to the extent it is deemed just and proper so as to relieve the difficulty or hardship in question, provided that such relief may be granted without detriment to the public interest.

ARTICLE 12. - BALLPARK AREA/SOUTHWEST SPRINGDALE DISTRICT OVERLAY 

Sec. 1. - General parameters. 
1.1  Purpose. 
a.  To create a strong framework for moving the entire overlay district area from its current uses into a fully developed, active destination. 
b.  To create a unique development as a regional attraction for entertainment, shopping, restaurants, offices, residences, and other uses. 
c.  To create an identifiable focal point within the many potential uses as well as creating a unique "brand" for the area. 
d.  To encourage the creation of a distinctive style and feel for development in this overlay district that is easily identified, punctuated by unique individualized building design, and not dictated by franchise architecture. 
e.  To encourage an orderly and logical pattern of development in the area interspersing multiple uses among the various primary components to create a truly unique destination. 
f.  To recognize the economic development potential for the area, ensuring that development is held to the highest levels of quality and consistency, both in terms of actual construction materials as well as overall aesthetic standards. 
g.  To offer clear quantitative review standards that are easy to administer and to offer certainty to developers, and citizens alike, while maintaining a requisite degree of design flexibility to allow and encourage creative site and building design. 
h.  To create overlay district guidelines that are more specific than the general design standards now in place. Overlay district guidelines will be tailored to this geographic area. 
1.2  Background and analysis. 
a.  History of site, ballpark, and overlay. The development site is over one thousand (1,000) acres. There are numerous landowners with holdings ranging from fewer than five (5) acres to over five hundred (500) acres. The site is largely undeveloped and currently home to livestock farming, miscellaneous businesses, and single-family residences. 
The site has had a varied history. It was previously used for vineyards and fruit groves. It was also a key poultry farming location. In 2008, through a cooperative effort between property owners and the City of Springdale, Arvest Ballpark was completed and opened as home to the Northwest Arkansas Naturals minor league baseball team. The ballpark is located at an interior location in the southern portion of the development. It represents a major initial regional attraction for the overlay district area. Further development is envisioned to take place over a period of approximately twenty (20) to thirty (30) years. The City of Springdale and development property owners have worked together to create specific overlay district guidelines to provide a framework in which multiple property owners can proceed with a mixed-use development that will benefit both the landowners and users, as well as generate economic benefit to the region. 
b.  Analysis of area development impact. Stakeholders such as landowners, businesses, institutions, and local citizens look forward to a development that is unique with a mix of uses and tenants that make it a regional destination. 
They also hope to create a distinct "brand" for the development utilizing the rich history of the land, area industry, and local entrepreneurs. Additionally, stakeholders look forward to other key features such as consistent design standards, sustainability, public art, long term planning, transportation options, and a sense of neighborhood. 
The development site is anticipated to have many potential uses such as entertainment, office, multi-family residential, retail, restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, medical, educational, recreational, among others. As the development progresses, it will have a significant impact on the local economy through increased business activity, job creation, and tax revenue. Arvest Ballpark represents a major initial step toward that goal.

c.  Exemptions. The following structures or uses shall be exempt from the overlay district requirements and development review, although they may be reviewed under separate administrative procedures where noted in this section or in other sections of the Springdale Code of Ordinances: 
(1)  Non-conforming structures. If a non-conforming structure is to be retained then the structure shall not be rebuilt, altered, or undergo major rehabilitation if such construction would exceed fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost. If rebuilding, alteration, or repair of a nonconforming structure exceeds fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost, then the building shall be required to conform to all provisions of the overlay district. 
Major rehabilitation shall mean any renovation, restoration, modification, addition, or retrofit of a structure that exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current appraised value of any structure as established by Washington County. Rehabilitation costs shall be aggregated over a five (5) year period to determine whether the development is subject to these rules effective on the date of this ordinance. 
Major rehabilitation shall not include routine maintenance and repair of a structure or other feature on the surrounding site, such as roof replacement or general repairs to a parking area or other site feature. 
(2)  Non-conforming uses. If an existing use is to stay in place as an existing non-conforming use, then the use shall not be changed. If the use is changed, then the building which houses the use shall be required to conform to the provisions of the overlay district at the time the use is changed. 
(3)  Change in use designation. A change in use unit designation of existing structure or structures on a tract or parcel of land that exists at the time approval of this overlay district will be determined by the most current business license of record in the city clerk's office.
