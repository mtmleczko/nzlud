PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Milledgeville, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2000 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Zanne Ebersole, Editor, and Aline True, Quality Control Captain, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Bo Danuser, City Clerk, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(16)  Regulation of subdivisions. In exercising the powers granted to it by this act [this section], the planning commission shall prepare and recommend to the city commission or the county commission for adoption regulations governing the subdivision of land within the municipality or unincorporated portion of the county respectively. Such regulations may provide for the harmonious development of the municipality and the county; for the coordination of streets within subdivisions with other existing or planned streets or official map streets; for the size of blocks and lots; for the dedication or reservation of land for streets, school sites, and recreation areas and of easements for utilities and other public services and facilities; and for a distribution of population and traffic which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience, prosperity or general welfare. Such regulations may include requirements as to the extent to which and the manner in which streets shall be graded, surfaced, and improved, and water, sewers, septic tanks, and other utility mains, piping, connections, or other facilities shall be installed as a condition precedent to the approval of the plat. Such regulations may provide that, in lieu of the completion of such work and installations previous to the final approval of a plat, the city commission or the county commission may accept a bond, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and securing to the municipality or county the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities within a period specified by the planning commission and expressed in the bond; and the municipality or county is hereby granted the power to enforce such bonds by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. The city commission and the county commission are hereby given the power to adopt and to amend such land subdivision regulations after a public hearing thereon, at least fifteen (15) days' notice of the time and place of which shall have been published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or county. 
(17)  Tentative plat approval. The planning commission is hereby given the authority to give tentative approval or disapproval to preliminary plats and to approve or disapprove final plats but in each case their action shall be taken within thirty (30) days after the submission thereof; otherwise, such plat shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided however, that the applicant for the planning commission's approval may waive this requirement and consent to the extension of such period. The ground of disapproval of any plat shall be stated upon the records of the planning commission. Any plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of a person to whom notice of hearing may be sent; and no plat shall be acted upon by the planning commission without affording a hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall be sent by registered or certified mail to said address not less than five (5) days before the date fixed therefor. 
(18)  Effect of plat approval on status of dedications. The approval of a plat by the planning commission shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the municipality or the county or the public of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. 
(19)  Penalties for transferring lots in unapproved subdivisions. The owner or agent of the owner of any land to be subdivided within the municipality or county who transfers or sells or agrees to sell or negotiates to sell such land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of subdivision of such land before such plat has been approved by the planning commission and recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Baldwin County, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided by law; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transfer shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. The municipality or county, through its attorney or other official designated by the city commission or the county commission, may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by appropriate action.

(21)  Erection of buildings. From and after the time when the platting jurisdiction of the planning commission shall have attached by virtue of adoption by the planning commission of a major street plan and the adoption by the city commission or the county commission of a set of land subdivision regulations recommended to them by the planning commission, as provided in section (15) of this act [subsection (15)], no building permit shall be issued for and no building or other structure shall be erected on any lot within the municipality or county unless the street giving access to the lot upon which said building is proposed to be placed shall be accepted or opened as, or shall have otherwise received the legal status of a public street prior to that time, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by said planning commission or on a street plat made and adopted by said planning commission or with a street located and accepted by the city commission or the county commission. Any building erected in violation of this section [this subsection] shall be deemed an unlawful structure, and the building inspector or municipal or county attorney or other official designated by the city commission or county commission may bring appropriate action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed. 
(22)  Official map. The city commission by ordinance and the county commission by resolution may establish an official map of the municipality or the county, respectively, showing the location of the streets, public building sites, and public open spaces therefore existing and established by law as public streets, public building sites or public open spaces. Such official map may also show the location of the boundary lines of streets, public building sites or public open spaces on plats of subdivisions which have been approved by the planning commission. The official map may include the whole or any part or parts of the municipality or county. In the event the official map thus established does not include the whole of the municipality or county but only certain part or parts thereof, then the city commission or the county commission may add to the official map by placing thereon, from time to time, the boundary lines of streets, public building sites or public open spaces which at the time of the establishment of the official map existed and were established by law as public streets, public building sites or public open spaces, or which appear on a plat which has been approved by the planning commission. The city commission or the county commission shall certify the fact of the establishment of the official map to the clerk of the superior court of Baldwin County. 
(23)  Platting of street, public building site or public open space lines by planning commission. From and after the time when the planning commission shall have prepared and adopted a master plan or at least the major street portion of such master plan, the planning commission shall have the power to make or cause to be made, from time to time, surveys for the exact location of the lines of new, extended, widened, or narrowed streets in the whole or in any portion of the municipality or county and to make and certify to the city commission or the county commission a plat or plats of the area thus surveyed on which are indicated the lines recommended by the planning commission as the mapped lines of future streets, street extensions, street widenings, or street narrowings. 
    From and after the time when the planning commission shall have prepared and adopted a master plan or at least the public building sites or public open spaces portion of such master plan, the planning commission shall have the power to make or cause to be made, from time to time, surveys of the exact location of the boundary lines of new, enlarged or diminished sites for public buildings or sites for parks, playgrounds, or other public open spaces in the whole or in any portion of the municipality or county and to make and certify to the city commission or the county commission a plat or plats of the areas thus surveyed on which are indicated the locations of the lines recommended by the planning commission, as the mapped boundary lines of future public building sites or public park, playground, or other public open space areas or of existing sites or areas that are to be extended or contracted. 
    The making or certifying of a plat by the planning commission shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any street or public building site or public park, playground or other public open space or the taking or acceptance of any land for such purposes. 
(24)  Establishment of proposed boundary lines of streets, public sites or public open spaces. From and after the time the planning commission shall have made and certified to the city commission or the county commission a plat or plats on which are indicated the locations of the lines recommended by the planning commission as the mapped boundary lines of future streets, street extensions or street widenings, street narrowings, public building sites, public park, playground or other public open space areas or of existing sites or areas that are to be expanded or contracted, the city commission by ordinance or the county commission by resolution may make from time to time additions to or modifications of the official map by adding thereon the plats certified by the planning commission.

(25)  Regulation of buildings and other structures in bed of mapped streets, public building sites or public open spaces. For the purpose of preserving the integrity of the official map, the city commission or county commission may provide by ordinance or resolution respectively, that no permit shall be issued for any building or structure or part thereof on any land located between the mapped lines of any street, public building site or public open spaces as shown on the official map. Any such ordinance or resolution shall provide that the zoning board of appeals, if the municipality or county has such a board or, it [if] not, a board of appeals created for the purpose in such ordinance or resolution, shall have the power, upon an appeal filed with it by the owner of any such land, to authorize the granting of a permit for a building or structure or part thereof within any such mapped lines in any case in which such board finds, upon the evidence and arguments presented to it upon such appeal: 
(a)  That the property of the appellant of which such mapped street, public building site, or public open space forms a part will not yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such permit be granted; or 
(b)  That, balancing the interests of the municipality or county in preserving the integrity of the official map and the interest of the owner in the use and benefits of his property, the granting of such permit is required by considerations of justice and equity.

The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells his business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event shall last occur. 
(d)  Money paid erroneously. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously collected or received by the city under this division, it may be offset as provided in subsection 6-267(c).

(Ord. No. O-1001-001, Exh. A, 2-9-2010) 
Sec. 42-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2); 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 5, pt. 6 the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c). 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. O-1001-001, Exh. A, 2-9-2010) 
Sec. 42-35. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the planning and development department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the planning and development department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 42-34(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), one-half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 42-34(c)(15) and (16). has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 42-34(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsection 42-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. O-1001-001, Exh. A, 2-9-2010) 
Sec. 42-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The planning and development department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The planning and development department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

Sec. 42-37. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 42-35(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day.

(Ord. No. O-01-11, 10-9-2001) 
Sec. 42-77. - Establishment of water resource districts. 
    The city's water resource districts shall include the following: 
Groundwater Recharge Area Protection District 
Wetlands Protection District 
Water Supply Watershed Protection District 
River Corridor Protection District 
    The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "Water Resource Districts" and are included as part of the city's official zoning map, which is on file in the building inspector's office located on Wilkinson Street. 
(Ord. No. O-01-11, 10-9-2001)

F. R. Section 261.3. (Note: This is same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.) 
    Impervious surface means a man-made structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios. 
    Jurisdictional wetland means an area that needs the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
    Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as amended. 
    Land-disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
    Large water supply watershed means a watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally-owned public drinking water supply intake. 
    Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area.

    The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the upper most part of the river banks, usually marked by a break-in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the River Corridor Protection District. 
    Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering river bank erosion and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the city comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs. 
    Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:

The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
(Ord. No. O-01-11, 10-9-2001) 
Sec. 42-79. - Groundwater recharge area protection district. 
(a)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
(c)  District delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection district is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)." Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 Edition." Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this article. 
(d)  Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
(1)  New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
(2)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
a.  A high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and 
c.  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size. 
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10- 7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the national resource and conservation service. 
(3)  New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimum set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. 
a.  One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
c.  One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
(4)  New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-2). The minimums set forth in Table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. 
a.  One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and 
c.  One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
(5)  No construction may proceed on a building or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank unless the Baldwin County Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (hereinafter DHR Manual and subsections (3) and (4) above. 
(6)  New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types (listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements. 
(7)  Permanent storm water infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.

Notes to Tables 
Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three- or four-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Baldwin County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area. 
Section B. The Baldwin County Board of Health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features. 
Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively. 
Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors. 
Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met. 
Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula: 
X =   5,000 gal/day   
1,200 gal/acre/day 
   = 4.17 acres 
   = 4.17 acres x 43,560 ft 2 /acre 
   = 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed. 
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula: 
Y =   5,000 gal/day   
600 gal/acre/day 
   = 8.33 acres 
   = 8.33 acres x 43,560 ft 2 /acre 
   = 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed. 
(e)  Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of this article is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in subsections (d)(3) and (4). 
(Ord. No. O-01-11, 10-9-2001) 
Sec. 42-80. - Wetlands protection district. 
(a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constrains due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, flood plain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
(c)  District delineation. The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto. 
    The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(d)  Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in subsection (e) shall be allowed within the wetlands protection district without a development permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until Section 404 [of the Clean Water Act] Permit or Letter of Permission is issued. 
(e)  Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetlands protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 [of the Act] regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.) 
(1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
(2)  Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
(3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
(4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
(5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
(6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
(f)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetlands protection district: 
(1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
(2)  Hazardous or sanitary landfills. 
(Ord. No. O-01-11, 10-9-2001) 
Sec. 42-81. - Water supply watershed protection district. 
(a)  Purpose. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter storm water runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, storm water runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city. 
(b)  Establishment of water supply watershed protection districts. The Oconee River water supply watershed protection districts are hereby designated and shall comprise the land that drains to the city water supply intakes. The boundaries of these overlays are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius of seven miles upstream of the respective public water supply intakes. These overlays shall be further delineated and defined on the water supply watershed protection district map of the city. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference. 
    The following water supply watershed districts are hereby defined, and the boundaries shall be identified on the water supply watershed protection district map. 
The Oconee River watershed is a large water supply watershed. The intakes for the city are located on the river. The water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir. 
(c)  Protection criteria. The following regulations shall apply to the Oconee water supply watershed identified on the adopted map as a large water supply watershed without a reservoir. 
New facilities, located within seven miles of a water supply intake or water supply reservoir, which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements or the requirements of the Standard Fire Prevention Code. 
(d)  Exemptions. The following uses shall be exempted: 
(1)  Land uses existing prior to the adoption of this article. 
(2)  Mining activities permitted by the department of natural resources under the Surface Mining Act. 
(3)  Utilities from the stream corridor buffer and setback area provisions in accordance with the following conditions if the utilities to be located in the buffer or setback areas cannot feasibly be located outside these areas: 
a.  The utilities shall be located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible. 
b.  The installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible. 
c.  The utilities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream. 
(4)  Specific forestry and agricultural activities in the stream corridor buffer and setback areas in accordance with the following conditions: 
a.  The activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission or the state department of agriculture. 
b.  The activity shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream. 
(Ord. No. O-01-11, 10-9-2001) 
Sec. 42-82. - River corridor protection district. 
(a)  Purpose. River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in the state. These corridors are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb flood waters. 
    The Oconee River has been designated as a protected river by the state. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Oconee River as defined herein. 
(b)  Establishment of Oconee River Corridor protection district. The Oconee River Corridor Protection District is hereby designated and shall comprise all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of the Oconee River within the city and being within 100 feet horizontally on the west side, of the river as measured from the river banks. Also included is the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river although this strip of land is not included as part of the 100-foot buffer requirement contained in the minimum standards. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Oconee River Corridor protection district map. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference. 
(c)  Protection criteria. 
(1)  Construction within the buffer area is prohibited except as provided herein. 
(2)  A natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained at all times in the river corridor, except as otherwise provided herein. 
(3)  The natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity. 
(4)  Septic tank and septic tank drain fields are prohibited in the river corridor, except as expressly provided in subsection (c)(5). 
(5)  Single-family dwellings including the usual appurtenances are permitted in the buffer area subject to the following conditions: 
a.  The dwelling shall be in compliance with all local zoning regulations. 
b.  The dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres. For the purposes of these standards, the size of the tract of the land shall not include any area that lies within the protected river, (that is, for tracts of land that include portions of a protected river, the area between the river banks cannot be counted towards the two-acre minimum size). 
c.  There shall be only one such dwelling on each two-acre or larger tract of land. 
d.  A septic tank or tanks serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 50-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.

(Ord. No. O-1008-011, 8-24-2010) 
Sec. 50-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection. and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. O-1008-011, 8-24-2010) 
Sec. 50-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. O-1008-011, 8-24-2010) 
Sec. 50-34. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains. electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood, blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. O-1008-011, 8-24-2010)

    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after 8/1/1979 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after 8/1/1979 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after 8/1/1979.

(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.)) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(g)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The zoning administrator or their designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. O-1008-011, 8-24-2010) 
Sec. 50-92. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 50-91(4), "Elevated buildings". 
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH Zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 50-63(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 50-91(6).) 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a.-c., above. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-36 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection (4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
(Ord. No. O-1008-011, 8-24-2010) 
Sec. 50-93. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-36 where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 50-36, then the zoning administrator or their designee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections (2) and (3)) shall apply. 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 50-91(4), "Elevated buildings". 
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
The zoning administrator or their designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

Sec. 50-94. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard (Zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-36, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 50-92. 
(Ord. No. O-1008-011, 8-24-2010) 
Sec. 50-95. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-36, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 50-91(4), "Elevated buildings".

After the designation by ordinance of a historic property or of a historic district, no material change in the appearance of the historic property, or of a structure, site or work of art within such historic district, shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless or until application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the commission. Such application shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs or plans as may be required by the commission.

(d)  Plans. An application for certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, or plans as may be required by the commission. 
(e)  Reaction to application. 
(1)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the esthetic, historical, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
(2)  The commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would have substantial adverse effects on the esthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. 
(f)  Notice; hearing. At least seven days prior to review of an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected materially by reason of the application, and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
(g)  Certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the esthetic, historical, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; general design, arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved; and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
(h)  Interior alterations. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangement or uses having no effect on exterior architectural features. 
(i)  Technical advice. When dealing with difficult technical questions, the commission shall have the power to seek expert advice.

(1)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within not more than 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property, or of a structure, site, or work of art located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. 
(2)  The failure of the commission to act within the 45-day period shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
(k)  Rejection of application. 
(1)  If the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons therefor, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
(2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits, and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. It shall be the responsibility of the commission to provide written notice to the building official, or such other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits, of the commission's rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness. 
(l)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in an exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meaning of the provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variance, modification, or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. An undue hardship shall be a situation not of the person's own making, which is: 
(1)  A problem unique to a specific property; or 
(2)  In order to comply with this article, the person will be in conflict with another ordinance of the city. 
(m)  Conformance with certificate. Work not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness shall be halted before it is completed.

The commission may, where such action is authorized by the council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, of the property or any interest therein. 
(q)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the council; the appeal must be applied for within 15 days after notification is sent. The council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the council finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the council made pursuant to the Georgia Historic Preservation Act, O.C.G.A. § 44-10-20 et seq., may be taken to the superior court of the county, in the manner provided by law, for appeals from a conviction for municipal or county ordinance violations.

(1)  The structure is of such interest or quality that it would reasonably meet national, state, or local criteria for designation as an historic or architectural landmark. 
(2)  The structure is of such unusual or uncommon design, texture or materials that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and expense. 
(3)  Retention of the structure would aid substantially in preserving and protecting a structure which meets criterion (1) or (2). 
Where the commission determines that one or more of these criteria are met, no certificate of appropriateness shall be issued and the application shall be denied.

No person other than an authorized employee of the city shall uncover, make any connection with or opening into, alter, use or disturb any public sewer or water main or appurtenances thereof except by written permission of the director. No connection to a public sewer shall be made except at a wye, manhole or connection point accepted by the director. 
(d)  Duties of owner. The owner of the property to be served shall be responsible for the cost, installation and maintenance of the building sewer or water service line from the facility to be served to a point where the building sewer or service line ties into the city's system, including any portions of the building sewer or service line which extend onto the public right-of-way or city easement. The owner shall comply with all pertinent federal and state laws, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws, and shall indemnify the city for any and all loss or damage, of every kind or nature that be occasioned, directly or indirectly, to any and all persons or entities whomsoever, by the installation and maintenance of the building sewer or water service line. 
(e)  Actions by and property of city. The water and sewerage department shall install and maintain all necessary fittings, pipes and appurtenances, including all meters and meter boxes, to deliver water to the water service line, at a point immediately outside the property line in an alley or easement. Notwithstanding that the applicant for service will have paid the cost of labor and materials, all such fittings, pipes, appurtenances, meters and meter boxes will be and remain the property of the city and shall be accessible to the city at all times and under its control. 
(f)  Materials. The water service line and building sewer shall be of appropriate material and of ample size, weight and quality for the premises and for the purpose intended and shall be subject to the approval of the director, who shall have authority to refuse connection and service to the premises, if in his discretion, he deems the installation inadequate. 
(g)  Number of connections. New connections for water service shall be available to individual customers on the basis of connection for each residential or business unit on the premises. Multiple residential or business units by a single connection will be available subject to the approval of the director.

(3)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the director in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations; 
(4)  Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature of quantity are or may be sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause a fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the wastewater system or the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, and any other substances which the city, the state or the EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard to the system; 
(5)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of POTW, cause the POTW to fail a toxicity test or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(A) of the Act; and 40 CFR 129. 
(6)  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case, shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Sections 257, 405, and 503 of the Act, and criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the solid waste disposal act, the clean air act, the toxic substances control act, the resource conservation and recovery act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used; 
(7)  Any substances which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit or the receiving water quality standards; 
(8)  Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance; 
(9)  Any waters or wastes containing concentrated acid iron pickling wastes or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not; 
(10)  Materials which exert or cause unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids, such as, but not limited to fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime residues; or of dissolved solids, such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate; 
(11)  Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes; 
(12)  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW. 
(f)  Correcting interference. When the director determines in accordance with sound engineering standards that a user is contributing to the POTW any of the substances that are listed in section 90-84(e) in such amount as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the director shall enforce specific limits to implement the prohibitions listed in section 90-83(d) and (e). 
(g)  Conditional discharges. No user shall discharge wastewater which exceeds the following concentration limits unless he has received the written permission of the director, or has contracted with the city in writing to discharge specific contaminants in excess of these limits:

For pollutants with a daily maximum concentration limit, the daily and monthly average limits shall equal the daily maximum limit. 
The concentration limits in subsection (g) of this section are set by the city as maximal. These limits apply to the discharges from all industrial users and other users (as appropriate) before they enter and are mixed with the public sewerage system. The actual sampling location for each industrial user will be stipulated in the permit. The limits may be reduced by order of the director at any time when it is found that the wastewater treatment plant does not meet its proper limits of treatment, and the director may establish concentration limits for other substances as may be appropriate. All users on the system must comply with all such standard limits within a reasonable time period established by the director, or as required by other regulatory agencies. 
The pollutants listed in subsection (g) of this section shall be analyzed to the appropriate detection limits as specified by the state environmental protection division. If the results for a given sample are such that a parameter is not detected at or above the specified detection limit, a value of "not detected" shall be reported for that sample and the detection limits will also be reported. A value of "not detected" shall be considered as within the allowable concentration limits listed in this section. 
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
Except for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(Ord. of 9-14-1999, § 18-53) 
Sec. 90-84. - Industrial discharge requirements. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for a significant industrial user to discharge industrial wastes to the wastewater treatment system except as authorized by a permit or an existing written contract with the city. 
(b)  Every significant industrial user discharging industrial wastes shall be required to have a written wastewater discharge permit from the city as authorized by O.C.G.A. § 36-60-2. Such permit shall govern the nature, constituents, characteristics and volume of the discharge permitted thereby. Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years from the effective date of the permit. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period less than five years, at the discretion of the director. Each wastewater discharge permit will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire. In every case, the provisions of this article shall become an integral part of this permit as if set forth verbatim therein, whether or not specially mentioned or expressly incorporated therein. In the event of conflict between the conditions of the permit and provisions of this article, this article shall be controlling. 
(c)  Before issuance of any discharge permit the director shall require the industrial user to submit any information as may be deemed by the director to be necessary to evaluate the application for discharge permit. 
(d)  The permit will specify the responsibilities which shall be required of the user. Failure of the user to comply with such requirements may result in penalties and/or discontinuance of water and sewerage service. Permits shall contain subsections (1) through (5) of this section and may contain subsections (6) through (14) of this section at the discretion of the director. 
(1)  Statement of the duration (not more than five years); 
(2)  Statement of nontransferability without prior notification to the director and provision of a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator; 
(3)  Effluent limits based on the pretreatment standards; 
(4)  Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and recordkeeping requirements, including an identification of the pollutants to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency and sample type, based on the pretreatment standards, categorical standards and local limits; 
(5)  Statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedules may not extend the compliance date beyond applicable federal deadlines; 
(6)  The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the wastewater to be discharged in the wastewater treatment system and unit surcharge for BOD in pounds or flow in excess of the limitations allotted to the user; 
(7)  Limits on maximum rate and time of discharge. Alternately, the permit may include requirements for flow rate regulation and/or flow equalization; 
(8)  Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and sampling facilities at the user's expense (section 90-85(h)); 
(9)  Compliance schedules for installation of pretreatment equipment by new and existing users; 
(10)  Requirements for submission of technical and/or discharge reports; 
(11)  Requirements for maintaining and retaining plant records relating to wastewater discharge as specified by the city, and allowing access thereto by representatives of the city, the environmental protection agency and the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources; 
(12)  Requirements for notification to the city of any new introduction of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of the wastewater constituent being introduced into the wastewater system; 
(13)  Requirement that the user notify the director within 24 hours after the permittee becomes aware of a permit violation; 
(14)  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to insure compliance with this article. 
(e)  All such permits shall be issued to a user for a specific operation and shall not be assigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the city. Upon approval of the city, any succeeding owner or user shall be fully bound by the conditions of the permit and this article. 
(Ord. of 9-14-1999, § 18-54) 
Sec. 90-85. - Pretreatment; monitoring; accidental discharge. 
(a)  Interceptors. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the director, based on sound engineering standards, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amount, any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. All interceptors shall be supplied and properly maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his own expense. 
(b)  Treatment generally. Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards and local limits within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be prepared by a registered engineer before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. In no way shall the city be responsible for the design or operation of the facilities; the right to review is intended only to assure compatibility of the pretreatment system with the city's wastewater treatment systems. 
(c)  Report of violators. The director shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that the director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(d)  Reports by users. The user may be required to submit to the director reports indicating the nature and concentration on of effluents on a periodic basis. Specific reporting requirements will be indicated in the user's permit. 
(1)  Wastewater discharge permit and reports. All wastewater discharge permit applications and user reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain the following certification statement: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(2)  Pollutant discharge reports. All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the director but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (d)(1) of this section. 
(3)  Baseline monitoring reports. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. Users described in subsection (2) of this section shall submit the following information: 
a.  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
b.  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be sampled and analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 90-83. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 90-85(d)(4). 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 90-85(d)(1) of this article. 
(4)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (d)(3)g. of this section: 
a.  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
b.  No increment referred to in subsection (a) shall exceed nine months; 
c.  The user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
d.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
(5)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in subsections (d)(3)d.-f. of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (d)(1) of this section; 
(6)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change: 
a.  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application pursuant to section 90-84. 
b.  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit pursuant to section 90-84(d) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
c.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases above current permit limit, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(7)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation; 
(8)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
a.  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (d)(6) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (d)(3)d. and e. of this section; 
b.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection a. of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
c.  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
d.  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
e.  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law. 
(9)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director. 
(e)  Pretreatment limits. No industry will exceed the pretreatment limits as established by the EPA in accordance with Section 307(B) and (C) of the Act (33 USC 1347) which applies to a specific category of industrial users. 
(f)  Diluting wastewater. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(g)  Public information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other government agency without restriction unless the user contends such information and data constitute a trade secret. 
(1)  When requested by the discharger, the portion of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall be submitted to the city for uses relating to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; but marked "confidential business information" on each page containing such information. All such pages shall be clearly marked at the time of submittal. If such a claim is made, the information shall not be released as public information. 
(2)  Such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review of enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing the report. 
(3)  Effluent data as provided to the city and collected by the city shall be available as public information. 
(h)  Monitoring. The city may require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities, to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility shall normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(i)  Federal standards-Generally. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed pursuant to this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations locally imposed. The director shall notify all affected users of the new standard and applicable reporting requirements. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(j)  Same-Modifications. Where the wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the state for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. The term "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2), general pretreatment regulations for existing and new sources of pollution promulgated pursuant to the act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(k)  Revision of permit. Upon the promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard, the permit of any user subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance within the time frame prescribed by such standard. 
(l)  Accidental or slug discharges. 
(1)  Generally. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, before construction of the facility. No industrial user who commences contribution to the POTW after September 11, 1984 shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been reviewed by the city. Review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
(2)  Emergency notification. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director and the city water pollution control plant of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(m)  Same-Report. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fine, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law or ordinance. 
(n)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by this section; and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response (40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v)). 
(o)  Director's rules. The director shall have full power and authority to promulgate, with the approval of the council, a pretreatment program pursuant to the Act and 40 CFR 403 et seq., and he is hereby vested with the authority and responsibility to enforce the same. To that end, he shall have full power to do any of the following: 
(1)  Deny any increased or new discharges or stipulate the conditions under which any increased or new discharge may be accepted to the system. 
(2)  Periodically (at least once every five years), develop revised local pretreatment limits for discharges by nondomestic users into the sewers and POTW of the city. Local limits shall be technically derived from federal and state standards and adjusted by POTW data and the most recent research. 
(3)  Require compliance with pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements by industrial users. 
(4)  Control industrial discharges to the treatment works to ensure compliance. 
(5)  Require the development of an industrial compliance schedule for installation of required technologies. 
(6)  Require nondomestic users to submit detailed information on the contaminants present in their discharge and to submit periodic self-monitoring reports to assess and assure compliance with this article. 
(7)  Conduct inspections, surveillance and monitoring procedures to independently determine compliance or noncompliance. 
(8)  Have the right of entry for inspection and sampling. The director shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this section. Users shall allow the director and the directors deputies ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. When toxic substances are being investigated, samples can be collected from any location in the user's facility for any toxic chemical analysis or bioassay. 
a.  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
b.  The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
c.  The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at the user's expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
d.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
e.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
f.  If the director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from the court of the city. 
(9)  Develop an enforcement response plan to assist city personnel when the nondomestic user is not in compliance with the pretreatment limits or permit requirements. Consistent use of this plan will assure that the pretreatment regulations are equitably enforced; 
(10)  Issue notifications of violation. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this section, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without issuing a notice of violation; 
(11)  Convene a show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this section, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user; 
(12)  Issue administrative compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this section or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user; 
(13)  Issue consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agrement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (o)(12) and (o)(14) of this article and shall be judicially enforceable; 
(14)  Issue cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease illegal or previously authorized discharges immediately or to terminate the noncompliant users discharge altogether. In an emergency situation, a cease and desist order can be used to protect the POTW and the receiving water body, in addition to public safety, even though the termination of the discharge will stop operations at the users facility; 
(15)  Independently assess, or recover through judicial action, fines, penalties and injunctive relief for noncompliance by industrial users with: 
a.  Pretreatment standards; 
b.  Inspections, entry or monitoring activities; 
c.  Any rules, regulations or orders; or 
d.  Any reporting requirements imposed. 
(16)  Issue emergency suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. Nothing in subsection (o)(18) of this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section: 
a.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (o)(19) of this section are initiated against the user. 
b.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (o)(11) or (o)(18) of this section. 
(17)  Terminate discharge. In addition to the provisions of this section, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
a.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; 
e.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 90-53. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(18)  Sewer water supply. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to comply; 
(19)  Petition for injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the court through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user; 
(20)  Do any and all other acts and things necessary or appropriate to comply with the general pretreatment regulations, 40 CFR 403, and to carry out the city's pretreatment program; and 
(p)  Water conservation program. The city will develop a water conservation program and all water and sewer customers are required to cooperate with the development of such program, and customers with water use in excess of 50,000 gallons per day will be required to provide an analysis of process water usage and develop a conservation program when requested by the city. 
(q)  State requirements generally. State requirements and limitations on discharge shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal or local requirements. 
(r)  Rules of city. The city reserves the right to establish more stringent limitations or requirements on the discharges to the wastewater disposal system, if such action is deemed necessary to comply with the objectives of this article. 
(s)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(t)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00 or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. 
(4)  If there is a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than three years, or both. 
(u)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations; upsets. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3) of this section are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, the following written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(v)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations; prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in section 90-85(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(w)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsection (w)(3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section. 
(3)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(4)  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(5)  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (w)(3) of this section. 
(6)  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (w)(5) of this section.

Sec. 90-86. - Hauled wastewaters. 
(a)  The city may require a permit for the discharge of septage after submission of an application on forms supplied by the city. Septage shall mean putrid or offensive matter, the contents of all privies, septic tanks and cesspools. All other materials and substances, chemicals or chemical compounds and/or industrial wastes will not be permitted to be discharged into the public sewerage system unless a discharge permit has been obtained for this waste as provided under section 90-84. Discharge permits will not permit the discharge of the substances prohibited in section 90-83(a) through (e). 
(b)  The discharge of hauled industrial wastes into the sewerage system is permissible at the discretion of the director. The director shall require generators of hauled industrial waste and leachate from municipal landfills to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The discharge of hauled leachate from municipal landfills will be subject to the same requirements as hauled industrial wastes. The director may require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director may also prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The disposal of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements under this article. 
(c)  All haulers for discharge of hauled septage, shall furnish the following information with each application: 
(1)  Name and address of applicant; 
(2)  Volume of septic waste for each numbered vehicle; 
(3)  Number of vehicles in septage collection service; and 
(4)  Characteristics of the wastes. 
(d)  The discharge of the wastes in subsection (a) and (b) of this section shall be made only at locations in the sewerage system as shall be designated by the director and at such times as are established by the director. The director may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The director may require the waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. Such waste shall not violate section 90-83 of this article or any other requirements established by the city. The disposal of prohibited substances, such as grease and other substances listed in section 90-83(d) and (e) is likewise prohibited when wastes are hauled to the sewage treatment plant. 
(e)  Hauled wastes will be admitted into the sewerage system only after approval by the director and subject to payment of a fee. Such fee shall be published separate from this article. 
(f)  The hauler shall be the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle discharging the wastes. All equipment, such as trucks, tanks, pumps and hose used in the collection and/or transportation of hauled wastewaters shall be modern equipment in good repair. When more than one vehicle is used by an applicant, each vehicle shall be assigned an identifying number. 
(g)  Prior to discharging any hauled wastes, the hauler must complete a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum the following: 
(1)  The name and address of the waste hauler; 
(2)  Discharge permit number (if the hauled waste is landfill leachate or industrial wastes); 
(3)  Truck identification; 
(4)  Names and addresses of sources of waste; and 
(5)  Volume and characteristics of waste. 
The form shall identify the known or suspected waste constituents and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. Any false, misleading or untruthful statement as to the nature or source of the material shall be cause for rejection of any further discharge from the applicant. Discharges may also be suspended or terminated at any time by the director for willful, continued or persistent violations of these rules and regulations. 
(Ord. of 9-14-1999, § 18-56) 
Sec. 90-87. - Connection to sanitary sewer system by users outside city limits. 
(a)  Persons residing without the limits of the city where no lines are available, and using only treated water furnished by the city, and desiring sanitary sewer service in instances where such services could be made available to said nonresidents, from the existing system, may obtain sewer service from the city upon approval of plans therefor by the council and by paying all labor, materials, equipment, rental and engineering fees required in the cost of construction of the sewer line or lines. The plans submitted must be drawn by a qualified person acceptable to the city. Such sewer line connections must be made by a licensed plumber at the expense of the applicant and subject to inspection by the city engineer or other authorized person appointed by the city. 
(b)  The sewer line, when laid, will become the property of the city and will be maintained by the city. The person or applicant will not be allowed to use the sanitary sewer for stormwater and surface drainage. 
(c)  All connections to said system by applicants must be done by a licensed plumber who will be required to secure a city permit and abide by the city plumbing code effective at the time of the work.
