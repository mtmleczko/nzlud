PREFACE 
    This volume contains the Code of Ordinances of the City of Margate, Florida. The Code is a revision and codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature that were deemed advisable to be included. 
    This Code is an entirely new codification and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all general and permanent ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole are included herein. Special ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are not included, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The original 1972 publication of the Code was adopted on February 9, 1972, with Ordinance No. 72-1. The publishers are most grateful to Mr. B. Paul Pettie, Jr., City Attorney, for his assistance during the publication process. The original Ordinance is available in the City Clerk's office for inspection. 
    This 2014 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 2013-4, adopted July 3, 2013, and was accomplished under the supervision of Howard George, Editor. The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Joseph J. Kavanagh, City Clerk, for his assistance during the republication process. 
ORGANIZATION OF CODE PROVISIONS 
    As will be noted, the chapters have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also directed to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant provisions of general state law. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the seventh section of Chapter 9 is 9-7. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter. New sections can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. Thus, if new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is to be added, the new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions to provide for future expansion. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a fractional number after the chapter number. As an example, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note in parentheses at the end thereof. 
LOOSELEAF SUPPLEMENT SERVICE 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is directed is the innovation of the looseleaf form of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this new looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instruction for inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such subsequent amendment when incorporated into this Code, will be cited as a part thereof as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for purposes of historical reference. 
INDEX 
    The index to the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
    The publishers are most grateful to all city officers and employees for their cooperation and interest during the preparation of this Code. Special appreciation is due Mr. B. Paul Pettie, Jr., City Attorney, during the original publication of the Code and Mr. Benjamin J. Ziskal, AICP, Director of Economic Development, during the 2014 republication. 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President and C. A. Neeley, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Margate.

(8)  Conducting hearings.

The alleged violator shall have the right to be represented by an attorney; however, the alleged violator or their attorney shall provide the office of the city attorney with written notice that an attorney is representing the violator's interest at least seven (7) working days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing. 
d.  All testimony before the special magistrate shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The alleged violator or the city may cause the proceedings to be recorded by a certified court reporter or other certified recording instrument; however, the city shall be under no obligation to provide a certified court reporter or other certified recording instrument but rather, the city may use a recording device of its choice to satisfy its obligation to record the meeting. 
e.  The burden of proof shall be with the code officer to show by the greater weight of evidence that a code violation exists and that the alleged violator committed or was responsible for maintaining the violation. 
f.  If written notice, or notice as contained in [F.S.] chapter 162, has been provided to an alleged violator of the hearing, a hearing may be conducted and an order rendered in the absence of the violator. 
g.  The special magistrate may, in his/her discretion, postpone or continue a hearing. 
h.  All determinations of the special magistrate shall be based upon competent substantial evidence. 
(9)  Construction of violations. Each and every act, action or thing done in violation of the provisions of this Code or an ordinance of the city shall be construed, deemed and taken as a separate and distinct violation of such provisions of this Code; and in every event that a violation of this Code or any of the provisions hereof shall continue, each day of such continuance shall be deemed, construed and taken as a separate and distinct violation of the provisions of this Code that such condition so allowed to continue shall violate. 
(10)  Establishing a fine and lien. 
a.  The establishment of a fine and lien shall be consistent with and pursuant to the provisions of F.S. ch. 162. 
b.  Fines levied by the special magistrate shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per violation of [for] the first violation, five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per day per violation for a repeat violation, and up to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) per violation if the special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable, or irreversible in nature. In determining what fine to levy, the special magistrate shall consider the following: 
1.  The gravity of the violation; 
2.  Any action taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
3.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
In addition to such fines, the special magistrate may impose additional fines to cover all costs incurred by the city in enforcing its codes and all costs and repairs where it is deemed that a violation presents a serious threat to the public, health, and welfare, or where the violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
c.  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine or costs of repairs may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land upon which the violation exists, or if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. It may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed otherwise to be a judgment of a court except for enforcement purposes. As authorized by law, the city may foreclose on duly recorded liens that have remained unpaid. Property subject to a lien established by the special magistrate may be foreclosed by the city in a manner provided by state law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property, or in the alternative, foreclosure proceedings may be instituted and prosecuted under the provisions of F.S. ch. 173, as currently enacted or as amended from time to time, or payment enforced otherwise as authorized by law. Upon an action for foreclosure, the city shall receive all costs, including reasonable attorney's fees necessary to institute and prosecute same. 
d.  Upon full payment of any lien, and all fees associated with the preparation, filing and release of the liens, the special magistrate or the city attorney shall be authorized to execute, record and deliver a full satisfaction of the lien to the violator, or his or her representative. 
e.  Liens created pursuant to the order of a Margate Special Magistrate and recorded in the public record shall remain liens coequal with the liens of all state, county, district and municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other liens, titles and claims, until paid, and shall bear interest annually at a rate not to exceed the legal rate allowed for such liens and may be foreclosed pursuant to the procedure set forth in F.S. chapter 173. 
(11)  The code enforcement special magistrate shall have the authority to reduce any fine either before or after a lien has been placed upon any property, taking into consideration the facts provided in (10)(b) of this section, along with any extenuating circumstances believed by the special magistrate to be just and proper. 
(12)  Code enforcement procedures of the special magistrate. The city commission may adopt by resolution such procedures as are deemed necessary and appropriate for the special magistrate to carry out their function as set forth in this subsection (c). 
(13)  Supplementary provisions. The provision and procedures contained in this section shall be in addition and supplemental to any other remedies now existing or subsequently provided for by law, regarding violations or municipal ordinances.

    Florida Statutes, § 163.387(2)(d)1. as amended by Chapter 2002-294, Laws of Florida, allows a local governing body that creates a community redevelopment agency under F.S. § 163.356, to exempt a special district that levies ad valorem taxes within that community redevelopment area from the annual obligation under F.S. § 163.387(1), to appropriate and deposit to the community redevelopment trust fund the amount of the increment revenues (the "payment obligation"). The city commission, as the local governing body that created the Margate Community Redevelopment Agency, may grant the exemption either in its sole discretion or in response to the request of the special district. 
(1)  The special district seeking an exemption from the payment obligation shall submit a written request for such exemption, which shall be in writing addressed to and delivered to the city manager no later than sixty (60) days prior to the start of the initial fiscal year of the period for which he special district is seeking to be exempted. The application shall be accompanied by a check payable to the city in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00), plus the cost of any advertisement(s) required under this subsection, which shall be used by the city to pay expenses it incurs in reviewing the application. The application shall address the considerations by the city commission set forth below in deciding whether to grant the exemption. 
(2)  In deciding whether to deny or grant a special district's request for exemption from the payment obligation, the city commission shall consider: 
a.  Any additional revenue sources of the community redevelopment agency which could be used in lieu of the special district's tax increment. 
b.  The fiscal and operational impact on the community redevelopment agency. 
c.  The fiscal and operational impact on the special district. 
d.  The benefit to the specific purpose for which the special district was created. The benefit to the special district must be based on specific projects contained in the approved community redevelopment plan for the community redevelopment area. 
e.  The impact of the exemption on incurred debt and whether such exemption will impair any outstanding bonds that have pledged tax increment revenues to the repayment of the bonds. 
f.  The benefit of the activities of the special district to the approved community redevelopment plan. 
g.  The benefit of the activities of the special district to the area of operation of the city commission. 
(3)  The city commission shall hold a public hearing on a special district's request for exemption after public notice of the hearing is published in a newspaper having a general circulation in the city. The notice shall describe the time, date, place, and purpose of the hearing and must identify generally the community redevelopment area covered by the plan and the impact of the plan on the special district that requested the exemption. 
(4)  If the city commission grants an exemption to a special district, the city and the special district shall promptly enter into an interlocal agreement that establishes the conditions of the exemption, including, but not limited to, the period of time for which the exemption is granted. 
(5)  If the city commission denies a request for exemption by a special district, the city commission shall provide to the special district a written analysis specifying the rationale for such denial. This written analysis must include, but is not limited to, the following information: 
a.  A separate, detailed examination of each consideration listed in subsection (2). 
b.  Specific examples of how the approved community redevelopment plan will benefit, and has already benefited the purpose for which the special district was created. 
(6)  The decision to either deny or grant an exemption must be made by the city commission within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date the request for exemption by the special district was filed with the city.

    An animal control officer or law enforcement officer shall conduct a probable cause investigation of reported incidents involving any dog that may be dangerous and shall, if possible, interview the owner and obtain a sworn affidavit from any person, including any animal control officer or law enforcement officer, desiring to have the dog classified as dangerous.

Violations of this section will result in a five-hundred-dollar fine to the owner or person harboring or having the care or custody of a dog under investigation. 
(1)  Any animal that is the subject of a dangerous dog investigation that cannot be safely confined to a secure enclosure shall be impounded with an animal control authority pending resolution of the investigation and resolution of any hearings relating to the dangerous dog classification. 
(2)  No dog that is the subject of a dangerous dog investigation may be relocated or ownership transferred pending the outcome of an investigation or any hearings related to the determination of a dangerous dog classification unless approved by the city police department. 
(3)  The owner or person harboring or having the care or custody of a dog under investigation as dangerous shall provide the address of where the animal resides to the city police department. 
(4)  Any dog under investigation as dangerous shall reside on the premises of the owner and no person owning, harboring or having the care or custody of the dog shall suffer or permit such dog to go at large or be unconfined on the premises of such person. A dangerous dog is unconfined, as that term is used in this section, if the dog is not confined to a secure enclosure or securely confined in a vehicle. 
(5)  No person owning, harboring, or having the care or custody of a dog under investigation as dangerous shall suffer or permit such dog to be outside of a completely enclosed and secure building or pen, as provided in this part, or unless such dog is securely muzzled and restrained by a chain or lead having a minimum tensile strength of three hundred (300) pounds and not exceeding three (3) feet in length and is under the physical control of the designated handler. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with his vision or respiration but will prevent it from biting any person or animal. 
(6)  No person owning, harboring, or having the care or custody of a dog under investigation as dangerous shall hide the accused dog or in any way hinder a dangerous dog investigation. 
(7)  Owners of a dog under investigation that wish to destroy the subject dog must coordinate with the investigating officer so as to assure that a quarantine is conducted if required, and to verify death.

Chapter 48. The owner may file a written request for a hearing within seven (7) days from the date of receipt of the notification of the sufficient cause finding and, if requested, the hearing shall be held by a hearing officer as soon as possible but not more than thirty (30) days and no sooner than five (5) days after receipt of the request from the owner. Failure to request a hearing within the seven-day period after the receipt of the notification of sufficient cause finding shall result in a final determination that the dog shall be classified as dangerous.

The owner shall be responsible for boarding fees, veterinary and other costs incurred by the city as may be required to humanely and safely keep the dog impounded during the appeal procedures, unless the owner prevails at the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Failure to timely request a hearing in the county court shall mean the owner has waived the right to appeal the dangerous dog classification and must comply with the provisions herein.

Such bond shall require the insurer to notify the police department within ten (10) days of cancellation, modification, termination or expiration of the bond.

If a dog that has been declared dangerous is relocated into or found to reside in the corporate limits of the city, the owner must be in compliance with all the requirements of this section. 
(3)  Any dog classified as dangerous shall reside on the premises of the owner and no person owning, harboring or having the care or custody of a dangerous dog shall suffer or permit such dog to go at large or be unconfined on the premises of such person. A dangerous dog is unconfined as that term is used in this section if the dog is not confined to a secure enclosure or securely confined in a vehicle.

(f)  Evidence of the training of dog(s), maintaining a place where dog(s) are kept, trained, permitted, or encouraged to fight, including, but not limited to, for exhibition, or for sport or wager, or the possession of paraphernalia known to be used for training, baiting or fighting, or any cage, structure, or arena for the purpose of confining animals to fight, or injuries or scarring consistent with gaming activity shall constitute a rebuttal presumption that said dog(s) are being harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of dog fighting. 
(g)  (1)  No person shall own or harbor any dog primarily trained and/or used for the purpose of defending or patrolling and protecting property without complying with sections 6-84, 6-85 and 6-86 of this chapter. 
Evidence of the training of a dog or person harboring such dog shall constitute a rebuttal presumption that the dog is owned or is being harbored for the purpose of causing or encouraging attacks on human beings or animals in violation hereof. It shall be no defense to a violation of this subdivision that such dog is being kept for guarding a residence or business establishment if compliance with sections 6-84, 6-85 and 6-86 has not been met, however, any dog found in violation of this subdivision that has not bitten a person or domestic animal shall not be declared dangerous if compliance with sections 6-84, 6-85 and 6-86 is met within two (2) days.

(c)  The franchise entity shall have the right to inspect the grantee's records from which its franchise payments are computed, and shall also have the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under the chapter. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the franchise entity may have for further or additional sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation hereunder; however, an accounting rendered to the franchise entity and to which no exception is made within three (3) years after receipt by the franchise entity shall be deemed to be accurate, and shall not thereafter be subject to question or made the basis of any claim by franchise entity against grantee.

(b)  Further, as an alternative to any change requested in (a) above, the grantee may request to increase the basic rate one time in any twelve-month period by the greater of five (5) per cent or the cumulative increase, if any, in the cost of living based upon the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers - United States Average (CPI) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. The cumulative increase in the CPI shall be calculated from October 1988. Notice of any rate increase made pursuant to this paragraph shall be filed with the city clerk thirty (30) or more days prior to implementation of the rate increase together with all supporting data to justify such increase. In the event the franchise authority should determine that such increase may not be justified, the franchise authority shall notify the grantee within thirty (30) days of the date of filing with the franchise authority. The grantee shall have the burden of proving to the franchise authority's satisfaction the justification for such increase. The determination of the franchise authority shall be final as to whether any increase pursuant to subsections (a) or (b) of this subsection (2) should be granted.

Sec. 17-1. - Administration. 
(1)  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of City of Margate, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance [chapter]." 
(2)  Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including, but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(3)  Intent. The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(a)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(b)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(c)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(d)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(f)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(g)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(h)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(4)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This chapter is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(5)  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended by the city, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring the city to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter. 
(6)  Disclaimer of liability. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city commission of City of Margate or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
( Ord. No. 2013-5, § 2, 8-28-2013 ) 
Sec. 17-2. - Applicability. 
(1)  General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
(2)  Areas to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all flood hazard areas within the City of Margate, as established in subsection 17-2(3) of this chapter. 
(3)  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance Study for Broward County, Florida and Incorporated Areas dated October 2, 1997, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this chapter and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the City of Margate Department of Environmental and Engineering Services located at 901 NW 66th Avenue, Margate, FL 33029. 
(4)  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to section 17-5 of this chapter the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida-licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
(a)  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this chapter and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(b)  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(5)  Other laws. The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
(6)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including, but not limited to, land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This chapter shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this chapter. 
(7)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
(a)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(b)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(c)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

Sec. 23-15. - Legislative findings. 
    The city commissioners hereby find that trees use their leaf surfaces to trap and filter out ash, dust and pollen in the air, thereby helping to alleviate air pollution; that trees help prevent erosion of the soil, thereby helping to protect the resources of all of the city belonging to the general public; that removal of trees causes increased surface runoff, which contributes to water pollution; that protection of trees increases the value of property, enhances the economic integrity of an area, by providing a camouflage for harsh scenery and softening the outline of masonry, metal and glass, thereby being a part of comprehensive land use planning; that trees slow down forceful wind velocities and cut noise pollution; that the living communities of native trees are a valuable educational and aesthetic natural heritage; and that it is necessary to regulate the cutting, trimming and pruning of trees to help ensure that the health, function and value of these important resources are protected.

    No personnel action, including that of hiring, promotion, demotion, termination, discipline or loss of any benefits by any employee, applicant or prospective employee, shall be deemed discriminatory unless found to be so by either the city manager, or, if appealed under this section, by the civil service board.

Sec. 30-70. - Abolishing of positions; reduction in force; resignation. 
    Separation of a permanent civil service employee resulting from the abolishing of his position because of lack of funds, curtailment of activities, realignment of functions and other conditions will be accomplished as follows: 
(1)  An employee may be assigned to an equal or lower graded position for which he is qualified when the position to which the employee has been assigned is abolished for any reason whatsoever. No permanent employee shall be laid off or reduced in grade while there is a temporary provisional or probationary employee serving in a position for which the permanent employee is qualified. 
(2)  For reduction-in-force purposes, seniority shall prevail. Length of service means total months of actual continuous employment with the city as a permanent employee. Retention of employees will be by seniority. At least twenty (20) working days prior to the reduction in force, the permanent employee will receive a written notice stating the reasons and the effective date of a reduction-in-force action. 
(3)  Employees laid off due to a reduction in force will be paid for all actual leave credits for which they are eligible. Payment for sick leave credits is not authorized except as may be provided in this chapter. 
(4)  All permanent employees laid off due to a reduction in force will be put on a reemployment list for a period of two (2) years. Such employees shall be referred against any vacancy, either temporary, emergency or permanent, prior to selecting an applicant from the eligibility list for which the employee is qualified. In addition, the employee may take exams for any two (2) positions within the city government. If the employee passes either or both of those exams, he or she will go on the eligibility list for that position or positions. When a vacancy occurs in either or both of these positions, a regular civil service exam will be held. If the employee who has previously taken the exams, because of the reduction in force, places first on either or both eligibility lists, he or she will be offered the positions available. 
(5)  With his or her written consent, an employee who is laid off due to a reduction in force may be assigned to an equal or lower graded position for which he or she is qualified. An employee shall be considered qualified for a position after obtaining a passing grade on a regularly scheduled examination, provided said examination was taken prior to the official date a reduction in force was approved by the city commission. 
    The employee will retain his or her salary if it falls within the range of the lower grade. If the employee's salary does not fall within the salary range of the lower grade, his or her salary will then be decreased to the top step of the lower graded position. 
(6)  If the position from which the permanent employee was laid off due to a reduction in force is re-created within a two-year period, said employee will be reassigned to that position and grade level held at the time of the reduction in force.

If a legal holiday comes within the leave period, an extra day may be taken. Annual leave in excess of sixty (60) work days will be forfeited at the end of the leave year. A fire department employee working a twenty-four-hour shift shall be able to accumulate up to four hundred sixty-eight (468) hours of vacation and holiday leave combined. 
(c)  No employee may work his annual leave. It is the expressed intention of this section that no employee may receive vacation pay in addition to his regular salary by working on his annual leave. All employees must take their annual leave time, except in an emergency situation when authorized by the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 77-10, § C, 7-6-1977; Ord. No. 80-32, § 1, 4-23-1980) 
Sec. 30-72. - Sick leave.

(b)  Any abuse of sick leave time shall be cause for disciplinary action. 
(c)  In the event an employee is injured in the line of duty, he will be placed on compensation in accordance with state laws. He will not be returned to duty until the compensation physician makes such authorization in a report, a copy of which will be placed in the employee's personnel file. 
(d)  In the event an employee is sick or injured, not in the line of duty and for an extended period, he will utilize sick and/or annual leave. He will not be returned to duty until his own physician certifies him capable of performing assigned duties, a copy of such certification to be placed in the employee's personnel file. The city manager shall have the right to appoint a qualified physician to examine the sick or injured employee to make a determination as to whether he is or is not capable of returning to duty and performing his assigned duties or whether, in his opinion, he may be temporarily or permanently disabled.

Sec. 30-73. - Military leave. 
(a)  Any member of the organized reserves of the United States armed services will be given necessary leave to fulfill his obligations, which leave will not be more than fifteen (15) calendar days per year. For all employees who participate in the United States military reserve programs, there shall be a salary supplement calculated so that the employees in the military reserve program of the United States shall receive a supplement equal to the difference between their military reserve salary and their weekly salary with the city for the entire time they are serving in their annual military training period. In no event will the total of their military reserve salary and the city supplement be an amount in excess of their weekly wage as an employee of the City of Margate. 
(b)  In the event an employee on the promotional eligibility list serving on active duty pursuant to military directives is certified and passed over for promotion during his absence, he will not be charged with loss of position on the eligibility list. However, the seniority of the employees on military leave continues to accrue for reduction in force and layoff purposes. Annual and sick leaves will not accrue during this period.

    Any employee called for jury duty will be granted leave with pay for actual time on jury duty. However, the amount received by the employee as jury duty pay will be deducted so as to provide the employee a total amount not exceeding his weekly pay as an employee of the City of Margate. While on jury duty, an employee will accumulate annual leave and sick leave. 
(Ord. No. 77-10, § C, 7-6-1977) 
Sec. 30-77. - Subpoena to testify, grant of leave. 
    Any employee in receipt of a subpoena to testify in any matter pertaining to the city, his duties or employment, and who will appear to testify pursuant to the receipt of a subpoena, will be granted leave with pay for actual time required for the employee to appear in court. Accumulation of sick leave and annual leave will continue in effect. 
(Ord. No. 77-10, § C, 7-6-1977; Ord. No. 81-45, § 1, 7-8-1981) 
Sec. 30-78. - Bereavement leave. 
    An employee will be authorized up to three (3) working days' leave in the event of death within the immediate family. The immediate family will include spouse, children, parents, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sisters or brothers. The accumulation of annual leave and sick leave will remain in effect during any authorized bereavement leave period. 
(Ord. No. 77-10, § C, 7-6-1977) 
Sec. 30-79. - Medical examinations; alternative employment, termination of medically disabled employees. 
(a)  General. The city manager may, if he feels it necessary, require an employee to take a medical examination. If the employee does not satisfactorily pass said medical examination and cannot perform the essential functions of the employee's job, then the employee's situation will be reviewed by the city manager and the department head involved, to determine if there is a vacant position for which the employee is qualified and which the employee can perform the essential functions of the job satisfactorily for the city. If there is none, every possible effort will be made to assist said employee to apply for a disability pension and/or other retirement or compensation in accordance with state law. If said employee is not eligible for any of the aforesaid, the employee will be terminated. 
(b)  Police personnel. Sworn police personnel, who [are to be terminated] because of job-related injury or disease, shall be terminated pursuant to the above only after one (1) year from the date of the injury or illness. 
(Ord. No. 77-10, § C, 7-6-1977; Ord. No. 79-15, § 1, 3-7-1979; Ord. No. 2000-3, § 1, 1-19-2000) 
Sec. 30-80. - Reimbursement from employees. 
    Apart from the city's right to discipline an employee, pursuant to the ordinances, rules or regulations of the City of Margate, the City of Margate shall have the right, as employer, to seek reimbursement from an employee who has caused damage to city property, or damage to the property of others for which the city is legally responsible by carelessness, negligence, or violation of any rule or regulation of their department or of the city, pursuant to the following procedure: 
If the city manager, in his sole discretion, determines that an employee is at fault for damages to city property, or to the property of others for which the city is legally responsible, then the following shall apply: 
(a)  First at fault incident-No monetary reimbursement; 
(b)  Any subsequent at fault incident within a twenty-four-month period from the date of the occurrence of the last at fault incident-two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) reimbursement, or the actual cost or replacement or repair of damaged property, whichever is less. 
Each at fault incident will result in a new twenty-four-month period from the date of occurrence of the last at fault incident for purposes of monetary reimbursement. As such, if an employee remains free from any at fault incidents for a consecutive twenty-four-month period, the next at fault incident will result in no monetary reimbursement as the above schedule will then apply. This provision, however, shall not prohibit the city from taking disciplinary action against any employee for just cause. 
Remedial training may be ordered by the respective department head for any employee who has been found to be at fault. However, if such training is ordered, it shall be completed while the employee is on duty. Further, because such training is not considered discipline, the employee shall have no right to appeal the remedial training order. 
(Ord. No. 99-16, § 2, 8-31-1999)

(C)  Testing based on reasonable suspicion. Any employee of the city who is believed to have violated the above-described rules may be required to take a drug test for controlled substance, drug or alcohol use contrary to these rules, upon reasonable suspicion as determined by the employee's department head, or designee.

    When in the judgement of the city engineer, it is determined that curbs and gutters are not required in certain subdivisions, he shall submit such recommendation in writing to the city commission for their approval. 
    This section does not require any additional developer's performance bonds or inspection fees not otherwise provided for by city ordinance. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, structures may be constructed on unplatted property which structures are to be used exclusively and temporarily as models for sales purposes, provided that the "models" meet all other requirements of the building code and that the developer has received prior approval of the planning and zoning board of the city for such structure or model.

a.  For any new commercial, industrial, retail development, mixed use application or any other development application other than a residential development application approved after the effective date of this ordinance, all utilities to be located within or in the public rights-of-way adjacent to the development and within that development even if not in the public rights-of-way shall be installed underground at the developer's and/or owner's cost. Existing overhead utilities on public rights-of-way adjacent to the new development and within that development, even if not in the public rights-of-way, shall be converted to underground utilities at the developer's and/or owner's cost, provided that, where applicable, such cost is determined pursuant to a utility's tariffs, such as those of Florida Power and Light Company, that are approved and enforceable by the Florida Public Service Commission. Where the costs are not subject to tariffs enforceable by the Florida Public Service Commission, it is the intent of this section that the city will not be responsible for any such costs, and that the apportionment of such costs between the developer, owner, and any utility shall be pursuant to a written agreement between the involved parties. For a project parcel located at a roadway intersection, the developer and/or owner shall be responsible to continue the underground conversion across the intersection to the nearest point/points of connection at no cost to the city. No overhead poles shall be allowed to stay adjacent to any parcel that is required to have underground utilities pursuant to this section of the City Code.

If any application is submitted after the effective date hereof for a permit to substantially redevelop or reconstruct an existing commercial, industrial, retail, mixed use or any project other than a residential development that occupies one (1) acre or more or that requires site plan approval, all utilities located within or in the public rights-of-way adjacent to that development and within that development, even if not in the public rights-of-way, shall be installed underground at the developer's and/or owner's cost. Existing overhead utilities shall be converted to underground utilities at the developer's and/or owner's cost. For a project parcel located at a roadway intersection, the developer and/or owner shall be responsible to continue the underground conversion across the intersection to the nearest point/points of connection at no cost to the city. No overhead poles shall be allowed to stay adjacent to any parcel that is required to have underground utilities pursuant to this section of the City Code. 
c.  1.  For any redevelopment or reconstruction of a residential project of five (5) acres or more or any new development or reconstruction of a residential project of five (5) units or more approved after the effective date hereof, all utilities located within or in the public rights-of-way adjacent to that development and all utilities located within the project site shall be installed underground at the developer's and/or owner's cost. All existing overhead utilities, including "service laterals" and "service drops" that serve individual residences, units, or commercial establishments in the public rights-of-way and in the project area, regardless whether such utility facilities are located in the rights-of-way or on private property, shall be converted to underground utilities at the developer's and/or owner's cost. When an area is converted to underground service for a project in which the city participates and front-ends the costs to obtain benefits available from any utility (including, without limitation, the reduced cost available from Florida Power and Light Company through that company's governmental adjustment factor waiver tariffs), each property owner in the affected area shall complete the conversion of his or her services, including service laterals or service drops, within ninety (90) days after the new underground facilities have been energized. For a project parcel located at a roadway intersection, the developer and/or owner shall be responsible to continue the underground conversion across the intersection to the nearest point/points of connection at no cost to the city. No overhead poles shall be allowed to stay adjacent to any parcel that is required to have underground utilities pursuant to this section of the City Code. 
2.  This section shall not be applicable to the remodeling or reconstruction of an individual single-family home, situated alone with no other residences on the same parcel, on any sized parcel of property existing on the property as of the effective date of this section. The intent of this subsection is to allow remodeling of an existing single-family home anywhere in the city that was constructed before the effective date of this section. 
(2)  Exception. Electrical transmission or distribution lines with a rated load of more than twenty-seven (27) kV (twenty-seven thousand (27,000) volts) shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. All electrical transmission or distribution lines with a rated load of twenty-seven (27) kV (twenty-seven thousand (27,000) volts) or less shall not be exempted from the requirements of this section. 
(3)  City participation. Upon application and execution of an agreement by a developer or property owner consistent with this section, the city may participate as an applicant or co-applicant for undergrounding projects in order to take advantage of benefits that may be available from the utility to local government applicants. The developer or property owner shall agree to reimburse the city for the city's costs, including without limitation attorney's costs, incurred in the city's participation in the project as contemplated by this section. In certain areas or projects where the city participates to underground utilities and pays all costs up front to obtain benefits available from any utility, including without limitation from Florida Power and Light Company, AT&T, Comcast, etc., each owner and/or developer who benefits from this conversion or undergrounding shall pay the city all expenses related to the conversion or undergrounding, including, but not limited to, design construction and/or any fees in a pro-rated manner as determined by the city commission. 
(4)  Process timing and waiver. 
a.  The developer and/or owner shall evidence compliance with the requirements in this division by providing to the city a signed agreement between the developer and/or the owner and each relevant utility showing that the utility has agreed, at the developer or owner's cost, to place or convert the relevant utilities underground, or the developer and/or owner has established an agreement with the city indicating their intent to comply with the undergrounding requirements of subsection (1)c.1., above. This evidence or application for waiver shall be submitted with the development application; if not thus submitted, then the development application shall be deemed incomplete. The city shall require this evidence or an application for waiver, as described in subsection b., below, to accompany the review of the development application by the development review committee. The city commission shall be the final authority to grant or deny said waiver application. 
b.  Any developer or owner subject to the requirements of this section may apply to the city, in a form specified by the city and accompanied by the payment of a waiver application fee seeking to be relieved of the requirements of this division. This waiver application must be submitted to the city prior to the time specified in subsection a., above. If the developer or owner claims that technical reasons are the basis for the waiver application, the application shall contain a detailed statement by a state licensed professional engineer, qualified with respect to utility issues, explaining why, in the engineer's professional opinion, it is technically infeasible to locate such utilities underground. The director of environmental and engineering services and the development services director shall review such application and shall make a recommendation to the city commission. The city commission shall have the authority to grant or deny a waiver. The city may grant a waiver if the application is supported by information detailing justifiable reasons for not pursuing the subject undergrounding, including, by way of example and not limitation, technical infeasibility or impracticability, practical infeasibility or impracticability, or costs outweigh perceived benefits, as determined by the city. 
c.  If a waiver is granted, a dollar amount equal to the cost of placing the utilities underground, as determined by an estimate established by the relevant utilities and as agreed upon by the city, shall be required to be paid into the city's underground utility trust fund prior to the development permits being issued.

This paragraph shall be construed with preference to the five (5) per cent of the overall subdivision as deeded or dedicated property rather than five (5) per cent of an individual plat. Where the area to be platted is less than sixty (60) acres, the developer shall place a sum equal to five (5) per cent of the value of the land in the city's parks and recreation fund to be held in escrow and used by the city for the purposes mentioned in subsection (4) below. Said five (5) per cent of the value of the land may be paid into the recreation trust fund at the time of plat approval or incrementally as approved by the city manager at the time building permits are issued for the construction of the units within the approved plat. The aforementioned value shall be the current appraised value of the land subdivided without improvements and shall be determined jointly by the city commission and the subdivider. If the city commission and the subdivider cannot agree on a land value, then the land value shall be established by appraisal. The city commission shall appoint a professional land appraiser, the subdivider shall appoint a professional land appraiser and these two (2) shall appoint a third. The three (3) appraisers shall then determine the value of the property for the purposes of these provisions.

(1)  In lieu of the dedication of land area as described in paragraph (E) above, the city commission may, in its discretion, accept a cash donation to the parks and recreation fund of the city to be used only for parks and recreational purposes an amount equal to the five (5) per cent figure referred to in paragraph (E); in the event the city commission and the subdivider cannot agree on the land value then the donation amount shall be determined as hereinabove provided for by arbitration. 
(2)  All real property donated shall be utilized for parks and recreation sites or facilities unless the following is found: 
(a)  The real property donated is found to be unsuitable for a park or recreation site; or 
(b)  A present park or recreation facility capable of being expanded for utilization by the citizens of a new development, subdivision or project is in such close proximity to the real property that it would provide a duplication of services. 
(3)  In the event that either (a) or (b) [of paragraph (E)(2)] is met, the city shall have the right to sell to the highest bidder the real property donated pursuant to the recreation donation, and all monies received by the city for said sale shall be deposited in the City of Margate Parks and Recreation Trust Fund. 
(4)  All monies utilized in the parks and recreation trust fund shall be utilized only for the acquisition and development of new parks and recreation facilities or the expansion and addition to older parks and recreation facilities so as to allow their utilization for new residents of the city. In addition to the foregoing, money received from all telecommunication tower rentals may be utilized for improvements, enhancements or other necessary expenses for parks and recreation purposes.

Sec. 31-45. - Measurement of capacities. 
(a)  Trafficways. The procedure for the initial measuring of highway capacities is the Florida Department of Transportation Table of Generalized Daily Level of Service Maximum Volumes. The measurement of capacity may also be determined by substantiation in the form of engineering studies or other data. Traffic analysis techniques must be technically sound and justifiable as determined by the Broward County Department of Strategic Planning and Growth Management and the city department of environmental and engineering services. Alterations to capacity on the state highway network shall require the opportunity for FDOT review. Measurement of county and state roads shall be in accordance with the development review requirements of the Broward County Land Development Code, Section 5-198. Before a development permit is approved, the following findings shall be made: 
(1)  A determination shall be required that the proposed development is not within the compact deferral area for a road segment operating below the adopted level of service, or that subsection (3) below is met. Traffic studies submitted by an applicant shall be considered in reaching this determination. 
(2)  A determination shall be required that the proposed development would not create a compact deferral area, including the development, or that subsection (3) below is met. 
(3)  If the proposed development is within a compact deferral area, or will be within a compact deferral area if the development is approved, one (1) of the following conditions applies: 
a.  The proposed development does not place any trips on the over-capacity link; or 
b.  There is an approved action plan to accommodate the traffic impact of the development; or 
c.  The necessary improvements to provide a level of service as provided for in section 31-48(c) are under construction at the time the permit is issued; or 
d.  The necessary improvements to provide a level of service as provided for in section 31-48(c) are the subject of an executed contract with a road contractor for the immediate construction of the facilities; or 
e.  The necessary improvements for a level of service as provided for in section 31-48 have been included in the first two (2) years of the adopted state, county or local five-year schedule of transportation improvements at the time a development permit is issued and although the facilities are not yet the subject of a binding contract for construction, the board of county commissioners and the city commissioners makes a good faith determination that a binding contractor construction of the improvement will be executed no later than the final day of the second fiscal year of the original schedule; or 
f.  The necessary improvements for the applicable level of service are provided for in an enforceable development agreement and will be available prior to certificates of occupancy that require those facilities. These may include, but not be limited to, development agreements pursuant to Section 163.3220, Florida Statutes, provided that road improvements required by an agreement shall not be considered for concurrency for property outside the boundaries of the property subject to a development agreement unless provisions b.-e. above are met; or 
g.  The development is authorized by an approved development of regional impact (DRI); or 
h.  The proposed development is a single-family unit or a duplex dwelling unit on a lot or parcel of record prior to May 30, 1990; provided that the traffic generated by the proposed development on the over-capacity link does not exceed one-tenth (0.1) of one per cent of the capacity of the over-capacity link at its assigned LOS. The cumulative impact of such exemptions shall not exceed one (1) per cent of the capacity of any over-capacity link during one (1) calendar year or a cumulative total cap of three (3) per cent of the capacity of any over-capacity link; or 
i.  The proposed development is found to have vested rights with regard to any affected road segments. The proposed development must meet concurrency for any road segment for which a vested rights determination has not been made; or 
j.  The proposed development is within an area designated on the Broward County Land Use Plan for urban infill, urban redevelopment or downtown revitalization; or 
k.  De minimus exception: The proposed development meets all of the following criteria: 
1.  For the proposed development on vacant land the residential density shall not exceed an average of four (4) dwelling units per gross acre and the non-residential floor area shall not exceed ten (10) per cent of the gross land area. 
2.  For the proposed redevelopment of developed property, the number of proposed dwelling units shall not exceed twice the number of existing dwelling units, and the proposed gross floor areas for non-residential use shall not exceed twice the existing floor area. Conversions between residential and non-residential uses shall not exceed twice the floor area of the original use. 
3.  The traffic generated on the proposed development on the over-capacity link does not exceed one-tenth (0.1) of one per cent of the capacity of that link at the adopted level of service. 
4.  The cumulative impact of such exemptions shall not exceed three (3) per cent of the capacity of any over-capacity link at its adopted level of service. 
5.  The total traffic generated by the proposed development shall not exceed five hundred (500) trips per day. If this provision is applied more than once on a parcel of land, then the cumulative total traffic generated by all such applications shall not exceed five hundred (500) trips per day, per plat, or per parcel of land for unplatted property which was a parcel of record as of March 20, 1979. 
6.  A notation is placed on the face of the plat, or is recorded against the property via separate document if the application is not for a plat, stating that if a building permit for a principal building is not issued on the subject property within three (3) years of the issuance of the development permit, that any finding of adequacy of the regional road network has expired, and that no additional building permits shall be issued unless the board of county commissioners and the city commission makes a new finding that the application satisfies the adequacy requirements of the regional road network. 
7.  If development is approved pursuant to this provision, in order to retain its de minimus exception designation, the use for which such development is approved may only be amended provided such development continues to be consistent with the criteria contained within this subsection. 
l.  Transfer of committed trips: 
1.  Committed trips may be transferred between two (2) contiguous parcels (i.e., a "donor parcel" and a "receiving parcel,") based on the following criteria: 
(a)  The donor parcel must be a recorded plat, with plat approval received on or after March 20, 1979. At the time of the approval of the transfer of the committed trips, the receiving parcel must have a pending or approved final application for a development permit filed with the county or the city (e.g., plat, site plan, rezoning, note amendment); 
(b)  The number of committed trips available for transfer on the donor parcel shall be the currently approved trip generation rate applied to the use approved for the parcel by the board of county commissioners, less any development which has been constructed, or for which building permits have been approved, within the donor parcel. In no case shall a transfer of trips result in no development being permitted on the donor plat; 
(c)  Simultaneously with the approval of the transfer of committed trips by the board of county commissioners, a notation shall be placed on the face of the plat of the parcels of record involved indicating the change in development levels associated with the transfer of such committed trips. Impact fees shall be recalculated based on the transfer of committed trips for both the donor and receiving parcels so that such impact fees are consistent with the modifications to development levels. All other provisions of the land development code which are applicable to note amendments and the placement of notes shall be enforced; and 
(d)  As a condition of the approval of a transfer of committed trips, an agreement shall be recorded in the public records against the receiving parcel stating that, if a building permit for a principal building representing some or all of the donated trips is not issued on the subject property within three (3) years of the approval of the transfer of committed trips, the county's finding of adequacy of the regional road network relative to the donated trips shall expire and no building permits for the donated trips shall be issued until such time as the board of county commissioners makes a subsequent finding that the application satisfies the adequacy requirements of the regional road network. The City of Margate shall also be a party to such agreement. 
2.  The receiving parcel shall not be a donor parcel in a subsequent transfer of trips. 
3.  The donor parcel shall not be entitled to apply for an amendment to the note on the face of the plat to increase the number of trips for a period of three (3) years from the date of approval of a transfer of committed trips. 
4.  For the purpose of this provision, a parcel of land separated by a right-of-way for a highway, road or utility, or a waterbody or watercourse which does not exceed three hundred (300) feet in width, shall be deemed contiguous. 
5.  Parcels of land within a DRI shall not donate trips to parcels of land outside the particular DRI. 
6.  Parcels of land within a concurrency exception area shall not be eligible to participate in a transfer of trips. 
7.  Transfers are limited to trips approved or vested prior to February 1994. 
(4)  Determination of concurrency for transportation: 
a.  The determination of concurrency with the regional transportation network shall be made by Broward County when a development is subject to concurrency review under the Broward County Land Development Code. However, when Broward County approves an action plan, the city commission shall also review and approve that action plan before recordation of that plat. 
b.  The determination of concurrency with the regional transportation network for developments which are not reviewed under the Broward County Land Development Code shall be made by the city through the required traffic analysis. If a development lies within a compact deferral area or its impacts would create a compact deferral area, it shall not be approved for concurrency purposes unless an action plan, as provided for in this article, is submitted and approved by the city commission. 
c.  The determination of concurrency for impacts on local collector roads will be made by the city either at the time of platting for areas subject to the Broward County Land Development Code or at the time of site plan review for developments not subject to the Broward County Land Development Code through the required traffic analysis. Developments subject to concurrency shall design all local streets for level of service "C." 
(b)  Potable water and wastewater. Measurement of potable water and wastewater facilities shall be based on design capacities and service flows. Usage and discharge will be based on adopted level of service standards. These levels may be amended after consideration and substantiation of engineering studies and/or an amendment to the City of Margate Comprehensive Plan. 
(c)  Drainage. 
(1)  Measurement of drainage facilities shall be based on the water management district basin design standards. Variations may exist for specific parcels but the overall effect of an area's drainage system must meet established water management practices criteria. 
(2)  Where the City of Margate is not the service provider, the city shall rely on documentation provided by the applicable water control/improvement district. However, determination of concurrency for drainage capacity for building pads, streets and parking lots shall be the responsibility of the department of environmental and engineering services. The documentation shall identify: 
a.  That the water control/improvement district will accept stormwater runoff from the proposed development; 
b.  That the district has the capacity to satisfy drainage of the proposed development at the required level of service; 
c.  That the district has improvements that will provide capacity at the required level of service; 
d.  Conditions or phasing exist that the city should incorporate in its approval to ensure adequate capacity. 
(d)  Solid waste. Measurement of solid waste shall be based on assumed generation rates and the design capacity of the landfill and the solid waste energy recovery facilities developed by the county. The city shall rely on the obligations' established in the city's franchise agreement for solid waste collection and disposal services to provide the required level of service. 
(e)  Recreation. Measurement of recreation and open space shall be based on the requirement of three (3) acres per one thousand (1,000) residents. 
(Ord. No. 94-19, § 1, 9-28-1994) 
Sec. 31-46. - Level of service standards. 
(a)  No development activity may be approved unless it meets the following requirements designed to ensure that certain public services are available at prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impacts of development. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during construction of new facilities in a specific area if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met. 
(c)  For the purposes of these regulations the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
(1)  Adding together: 
a.  The total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
b.  The total design capacity of new facilities that will come available concurrent with the impact of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if it meets the criteria of section 31-45(a)(3) above. 
(2)  Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
a.  The design demand for the service created by existing development; and 
b.  The new design demand for the service (by phase or otherwise) that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development by the anticipated completion of other presently approved developments. 
(d)  The burden of showing compliance with these levels of service requirements shall be upon the developer. Applications for development approval shall provide sufficient and verifiable information showing compliance with these standards. 
(Ord. No. 94-19, § 1, 9-28-1994) 
Sec. 31-47. - Concurrency monitoring system. 
(a)  The director of environmental and engineering services, through his duties and authority of chairman of the development review committee, shall be responsible for monitoring development activity to ensure the development is consistent with the City of Margate Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  Applications for all development permits shall be submitted to the development review committee. Processing shall be in accordance with regularly scheduled meetings of the development review committee, planning and zoning board and city commission. 
(c)  Compliance will be calculated and capacity reserved at time of final action of an approved site plan or enforceable developer's agreement for those concurrency matters within the authority of the City of Margate. Applications for development approval shall be chronologically logged to determine rights to available capacity. 
(d)  The effective time limit for site plans shall be one (1) year. An extension of one (1) year may be issued by administrative approval. At each annual renewal of public performance bonds, the City of Margate shall make a determination if the bonds shall be drawn upon for construction. Building and engineering permits shall have a concurrency time limit of one hundred eighty (180) days as long as construction and inspections continue. 
(e)  Development permits shall be processed to the fullest degree possible. If adequacy determinations of a project show unacceptable levels of service in any one (1) of the necessary public facility or service standards, the project shall be tabled during final action of the development permit approval. If capacity conditions change at some time in the future, concurrency shall be rechecked to verify compliance with adopted levels of service. If compliance is found the development shall be rescheduled for final action. 
(Ord. No. 94-19, § 1, 9-28-1994)

(5)  Relocate and/or replace newsracks which result in drivers' sight line obstruction, a visual blight and/or excessive space allocation on the public rights-of-way, or which unreasonably detract from the aesthetics of store window displays, adjacent landscaping and other improvements, as well as to have abandoned newsracks removed; 
(6)  Reduce unnecessary exposure of the public to personal injury or property damage; 
(7)  Maintain and protect the value of surrounding properties; 
(8)  Treat all newspapers equally regardless of their size, content, circulation, or frequency of publication;

(a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around a public school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, public park or public playground, wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

(b)  For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary residence to nearest outer property line of a public or private school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, public park, or public playground. 
(c)  Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding sixty (60) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
(d)  Exceptions. A person residing within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of any public or private school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, public park or public playground does not commit a violation of this section if any of the following apply:

Sec. 39-4. - Construction requirements. 
(A)  Location. 
(1)  Water mains. Water mains shall be installed in public rights-of-way only and, unless changed by reason of interference with existing utilities, the platting of half-streets or other valid cause, they shall be on the south and east sides of the rights-of-way. These requirements may be modified in special cases, where justified. In general, the offset from the property line shall be ten (10) feet, but this requirement may be waived to prevent interference or to suit special conditions. For rights-of-way wider than seventy (70) feet, the offset shall be individually determined by the manner of pavement and the location of other utilities and drainage structures. The separation, encasing and other requirements governing the location of water and sanitary sewer facilities in the same right-of-way shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of the State Board of Health. 
(2)  Cover. In general, the minimum cover on all water mains shall be either thirty (30) inches or any greater amount necessary to insure that the operating nuts of the valves shall have clearance below the bottom of the valve box cover. The minimum cover for all PVC main distribution lines shall be thirty-six (36) inches. The grade of sanitary sewer house connections shall be considered in determining water main cover. Services crossing the street shall have twenty-four-inch cover, and nearside services shall have eighteen-inch cover. 
(3)  Gate valves. All gate valves for the water mains shall be located on the extended property line of the intersecting street, except where the use of a tapping sleeve and valve is required. Small meters shall be located in precast concrete boxes and may be set inside property lines. Large meters and their controlling valves shall be located in concrete or brick vaults with removable plate or grating covers. The vaults shall be placed on the right-of-way or on the customer's property, outside of the buildings, and readily accessible. Copper tubing services shall be installed with corporation stop at the main, or adapter if connected to a galvanized fitting, and may be run in a straight line to a curb stop or meter yoke with stop. 
(B)  Hydrostatic tests. After a new water main has been laid and backfilled between joints, it shall be flushed for a sufficient time to replace the water in the main at least twice. It shall then be pumped to a pressure of one hundred twenty-five (125) psi and all visible leaks stopped by approved methods. A leakage test shall then be conducted at the above-mentioned pressure, and no installation will be acceptable by the engineer until the leakage is less than the number of gallons per hour as determined by the formula developed by the AWWA Specification C600-77: 

in which L is the allowable leakage, in gallons per hour; N is the approximate number of joints in the length of the pipeline tested; D is the nominal diameter of the pipe, in inches; and P is the average test pressure during the leakage test, in pounds per square inch gauge. The test is usually maintained for two (2) hours but it may be discontinued after one (1) hour if it becomes apparent that the leakage is substantially less than the amount allowable. Water supplied to the main during the test to maintain the required pressure shall be measured by a five-eighths-inch meter installed on the discharge side of the test pump, or by pumping from a calibrated container, all in accordance with AWWA Specification C600. 
(C)  Sterilization. After the water mains have satisfied the leakage requirements, they shall be sterilized in accordance with the applicable sections of AWWA Specification C601. On main breaks, cutins, etc., a liberal application of calcium hypochlorite shall be made. Mains shall not be put into domestic service until after the necessary bacteriological samples have been approved by the Broward County Health Department.

Sec. 39-32. - General requirements. 
(a)  General discharge prohibitions. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to the national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
(1)  Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their nature or quantity, are or may be sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five (5) per cent nor any single reading over ten (10) per cent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include but are not limited to gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other substances which the city, the state or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. 
(2)  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, such as but not limited to: Grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half (1/2) inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass-grinding or polishing wastes. 
(3)  Any wastewater having a pH less than five (5.0) unless the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the act. 
(5)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(6)  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
(7)  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards. 
(8)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as but not limited to dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(9)  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds forty (40) degrees Celsius (one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit) unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate such temperature. 
(10)  Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes more than five (5) times the average twenty-four-hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal operation. 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such halflife or concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
    When the superintendent determines that a user(s) is contributing to the POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the superintendent shall: 
(1)  Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; 
(2)  Develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to correct the interference with the POTW. 
(b)  Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than the limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The superintendent shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12. 
(c)  Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards. Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. Consistent removal shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in ninety-five (95) per cent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403, General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution, promulgated pursuant to the act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Part 403, Section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(d)  Specific pollutant limitations. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of: 
Mg/l     Pollutant 
0.50 ..... Cadmium 
2.00 ..... Copper 
5.00 ..... Cyanide 
0.60 ..... Lead 
1.80 ..... Nickel 
2.61 ..... Zinc 
(e)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article. 
(f)  City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish by article more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 39-30 of this article. 
(g)  Excessive discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. ( Comment: Dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with some of the prohibitions set forth in subsection (a) herein, e.g., the pH prohibition). 
(h)  Accidental discharges. Each nonresidential user shall provide protection from the accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by January 1, 1991. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions. 
(1)  Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(2)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

( Comment: Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator). 
c.  When a violation occurs, the city shall require the user to resample and resubmit results within thirty (30) days of the date of violation. 
(d)  Monitoring facilities. The city shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building water supply and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises; but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
    There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
    Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the city. 
(e)  Inspection and Sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, the approval authority and (where the NPDES state is the approval authority) and the EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, the approval authority and the EPA will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
    Industrial users shall be required to maintain adequate written records relating to discharges to the wastewater system, and sewer records shall be available for inspection by the city and all regulatory agencies. The city shall also have the right to copy the industrial users' records. 
(f)  Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
    The city shall annually publish in a newspaper published within Broward County a list of the users which are not in compliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the twelve (12) previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same (12) months. 
    All records relating to compliance with the pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or the approval authority upon request. 
(g)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
    When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
    Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the city until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user. 
(Ord. No. 90-5, § 1, 7-11-1990) 
Sec. 39-35. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the city engineer finds that any industrial user has violated, or is violating the pretreatment ordinance, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the city engineer or his agent may serve upon said user written notice of the violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the city engineer. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user for liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b)  Administrative order. When the city engineer finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the ordinance or permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonable, necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. 
(c)  Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this section, any user who is found to have violated any provision of the pretreatment ordinance, or permits and orders issued hereunder, may be fined in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the city engineer shall have such other collection remedies as he has to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual user's property. 
(d)  Emergency suspensions. 
(1)  The city engineer may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit of an industrial user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment. 
(2)  Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city engineer shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city engineer shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings are initiated against the user. 
(3)  An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement to the city engineer describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. 
(e)  Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing to discharge into the POTW, must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the control authority. Any user who violates the following conditions of this section or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable or state and federal law, is subject to permit termination: 
(1)  Violation of permit conditions. 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge. 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling. 
(f)  Judicial remedies. If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this section or any order or permit issued hereunder, the city engineer, through the city attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the circuit court for the county. 
(g)  Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section or permit or order issued hereunder, the city engineer, through counsel may petition the court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the industrial user. The city engineer shall have such remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect other sewer service charges. 
(h)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  Any industrial user who has violated or continues to violate this section or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of not more than the maximum allowable under state law, plus actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition to the above-described penalty and damages, the city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses. 
(2)  The city attorney shall petition the court to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In determining amount of liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, and any economic benefit gained through the industrial user's violation, corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors as justice requires. 
(i)  Criminal prosecution, violations. 
(1)  Any industrial user who willfully violates any provision of this section or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both. 
(2)  In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than three (3) years, or both. 
(j)  Annual publication of significant noncompliance. The city engineer shall publish, at least annually in the largest daily newspaper circulated in the service area, a description of those industrial users which are found to be in significant noncompliance (as defined below), with any provisions of this section or any permit or order issued hereunder during the period since the previous publication. Violations which meet one (1) or more of the following criteria are considered significant noncompliance: 
(1)  Violations of wastewater discharge limits. 
a.  Chronic violations. Sixty-six (66) per cent or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in six-month period (any magnitude of exceedance). 
b.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations. Thirty-three (33) per cent or more of the measurements exceeded the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit by more than the TRC in a six-month period. 
c.  Any other violation(s) of effluent limit (average or daily maximum) that the control authority believes has caused alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, or endangered the health of the sewage treatment personnel or the public. 
d.  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health and welfare or to the environment and has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge. 
(2)  Violations of compliance schedule milestones contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, and attaining final compliance by ninety (90) days or more after the schedule date.

    Trenches are to be dug with vertical walls and stopped short of final depth when mechanical equipment is used. Digging to final depth shall be done by hand to prevent disturbing soil below the pipe. The bottom of the trench is to be formed to the curvature of the pipe. If digging exceeds the invert of the pipe, loose soil must be removed and gravel or granular materials, well-compacted, must be used to bring the trench back to grade, forming a bottom that conforms to the bottom quadrant of the pipe. If rock is encountered, trench depth must be dug four (4) inches to six (6) inches below the invert of the pipe and gravel or granular material must be added and well compacted to bring the base to grade. Width of the trench must be kept to a minimum. The maximum trench at the top of the pipe shall not exceed the outside diameter of the pipe plus two and zero-tenths (2.0) feet. The excavation shall not exceed one hundred (100) feet ahead of the pipelaying operations. Any unsuitable materials must be removed and replaced with gravel, crushed rock, or sand and be compacted to a ninety-five (95) per cent maximum density. Gravity sewers shall be laid in accordance with ASTM C12. 
    Pipe shall be laid straight and with a uniform invert. Spigot ends must point toward the direction of flow. Care must be maintained that the manufacturer's recommendations are followed at all times. Couplings to manholes shall be used at each manhole entrance and shall be bedded in a nonshrinking mortar grout to provide a watertight, flexible connection. The coupling compression ring shall meet the requirements of ASTM D1869-66. As the pipe is laid, backfill is to be placed and hand-tamped along the sides so that pipe will not move from the true line. The fill must be loose, clean fill, free from debris. The fill must be placed in six-inch lifts to twelve (12) inches above the top of the pipe. Compacting to final grade from twelve (12) inches above pipe may be done in twelve-inch lifts. Any unusual conditions must be brought to the engineer's attention. 
(Ord. No. 78-37, § 1, 10-25-1978) 
Sec. 39-48. - Testing and certifications. 
    All pipe and fittings shall be certified by the manufacturer as meeting all the requirements as specified. 
    All gravity-flow pipelines shall be subject to tests for leakage. These tests shall be both infiltration and exfiltration tests subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  Exfiltration tests shall be conducted on every portion of the system, including service laterals, unless otherwise waived by the engineer. The water level or internal pressure to be used for exfiltration tests shall be determined by the engineer. 
(2)  Infiltration tests shall be conducted on all mains and service laterals where the pipe inverts are below the ground water table. 
The tests and measurements of infiltration and exfiltration shall be conducted in a manner approved by the engineer and shall apply to the whole system or any portion thereof. All tests shall be made and conducted by the contractor in the presence of the engineer, and the cost thereof shall be borne by the contractor. 
    Final infiltration and exfiltration tests shall be made after all backfilling operations and pavement restorations are completed and the lines are cleaned and ready for use. The leakage into or out of the system through the mains, service connections and manholes shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) gallons per inch diameter per mile of pipe per twenty-four-hour day. In determining the allowable leakage, the length of service laterals shall not be included. 
    All water used for exfiltration tests shall be of quality acceptable to the engineer and shall be furnished by the contractor.

The customer shall provide meter space to the city at a suitable and readily accessible location and when the city considers it advisable, within the premises to be served, adequate and proper space for the installation of meters and other similar devices. 
(23)  All water/sewer through meter. That portion of the customer's installation for water/sewer service shall be so arranged that all water/sewer shall pass through the meter. No temporary pipes, nipples, or spaces are permitted and under no circumstances are connections allowed which may permit water to bypass the meter or metering equipment. 
(24)  Adjustment of bills. When a customer has been overcharged or undercharged as a result of incorrect application of the rate schedules, incorrect reading of the meter, incorrect connection of the meter, or other similar reasons, the amount may be credited or billed to the customer as the case may be. 
(25)  Customer deposit. Before rendering service, the city will require a deposit or guarantee satisfactory to the city to secure the payment of bills; and the city shall give the customers a non-negotiable and nontransferable deposit receipt. The amount of a deposit shall be as per Ordinance No. 82-20 [section 39-71(C) of this Code]. 
    If customer's water/sewer service is disconnected for nonpayment twice within a six-month period, that customer may be required to maintain a deposit double the current deposit amount at the discretion of the administration. 
    Upon final settlement of customer's account, any unused balance of the deposit will be refunded. Refund is contingent upon surrender to the city of the applicable deposit receipt or, when the receipt cannot be produced, upon adequate identification. The additional deposit may be refunded, at the customer's request if the customer's water/sewer service is not disconnected for nonpayment for a one-year period following the collection of the additional deposit. Upon final settlement of customer's account, the city shall refund the net amount thereof after deducting such funds that may be due the city. 
(26)  Request for meter test by customer. Should any customer request a bench test of his water/sewer meter, the city will require a deposit to defray cost of testing; such deposit not to exceed the following schedule of fees: 
Meter Size   Fee 5/8 inch by 3/4 inch and 1 inch: .....  As listed in section 39-71 1&half inches and 2 inches: .....  As listed in section 39-71 Above 2 inches: .....  Negotiated  
    If the meter is found to register in excess of the accuracy limits prescribed by this tariff, the deposit will be refunded; but if below such accuracy limit, the deposit will be retained by the city as a service charge for conducting the test. 
(27)  Adjustment of bills for meter error. In meter tests made by the city, the accuracy of registration of the meter and its performance in service shall be judged by its average error. The average meter error shall be considered to be the average of the errors at the test rate flows. 
    Fast meters. Whenever a meter tested is found to register fast in excess of the tolerance provided in the meter accuracy requirements provision herein, the utility shall refund to the customer the amount billed in error for one-half the period since the last test, said one-half period not to exceed six (6) months except that if it can be shown that error was due to come cause, the date of which can be fixed, the overcharge shall be computed back to but not beyond such date. The refund shall not include any part of any minimum charge. 
    Meter accuracy requirements. All meters used for measuring quantity of water delivered to a customer shall be in good mechanical condition and shall be adequate in size and design for the type of service which they measure. Before being installed for the use of any customer, every water/sewer meter, whether new, repaired, or removed from service for any cause, shall be adjusted to register within the accuracy limits set forth in the following table: 
Accuracy Limits in Per cent Meter Type Maximum 
Rate Intermediate 
Rate New Repaired Displacement 98.5-101.5 98.5-101.5 95-101.5 90-101.5 Current 97-103 97-103 95-103 90-103 Compound 1 97-103 97-103 95-103 90-103

Sec. 39-72. - Service availability charge mandatory; water shutoff not separation from system; procedure for excuse from service availability charge; reconnection to system. 
(A)  From and after the effective date of this section, any individual commercial use or unit, whether it be a part of a common structure or apart from same, which has facilities for water and/or sewer shall be required to have a metered connection to the water/sewer system of the city and pay respective service availability charges. 
(1)  Multiuse and multitenant structures may utilize a master meter, subject to the following conditions: 
(a)  Service availability charges for any structure utilizing a master meter shall be calculated based upon each individual use or unit as if said use or unit were separately metered pursuant to the paragraph above. 
(b)  Any master meter that is two (2) inches in diameter or greater shall be a compound meter. If an existing meter is not a compound meter, then the existing meter shall be replaced with a compound meter at the expense of the property owner. 
(c)  Any structure or use utilizing a master meter shall have the water usage evaluated on an annual basis. If it is found that water usage has increased beyond the reserved or previously purchased equivalent residential connections (ERCs) then the property owner shall pay additional impact fees for the difference of ERCs required for the structure or use. 
(B)  Water and sewer availability charges shall be paid regardless of water consumption for any particular month. It is expressly established herein that water shut off or disconnection from the city water and sewer facility shall not constitute separation from the system, excusing payment of the water and sewer availability charges except as provided in subsection (C). 
(C)  In order for a structure or parts of a structure which have facilities for water and sewer service to be disconnected and excused from payment of water and sewer availability charges, the owner of said structure or parts of structure must do the following: 
(1)  Remove all internal facilities which allow for the use of water and/or sewer service, including all sinks, toilets, tubs, spigots, etc. 
(2)  Request that the water meter(s) involved be removed. 
(3)  Notify both the city building department and the department of environmental and engineering services (DEES) that all water and sewer facilities have been removed and that service availability charge should be terminated as to the subject as to the subject structure or part of structure. 
(D)  Should water and sewer service be requested to a structure subsequent to disconnection as provided for in subsection (C) above, there shall be paid by the individual requesting reestablishment of service a charge of three hundred dollars ($300.00). 
(E)  Should a user which is a trailer park wish to disconnect service so as to be excused from the payment of water and sewer availability charges, said trailer park must comply with paragraphs (C)(1) through (3) above and also make such alterations which, in the opinion of the department of environmental and engineering services, would permanently decrease their capacity to use water and sewer from the city. 
(Ord. No. 77-30, § 5, 11-16-1977; Ord. No. 79-30, § 1, 7-11-1979; Ord. No. 79-52, § 1, 11-21-1979; Ord. No. 81-55, § 1, 11-18-1981; Ord. No. 82-16, § 1, 4-21-1982; Ord. No. 2011-7, § 1, 7-6-2011) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 81-55, § 5, adopted Nov. 18, 1981, provided that said ordinance be retroactive to October 21, 1981. 
Sec. 39-73. - Connection charges. 
(a)  There shall be paid by all users (a user shall be defined as an owner, builder, occupant, tenant, or other prospective consumer of water and waste water service) connecting into the water and/or waste water system, at the time application is made for a building permit, water and waste water connection charges as listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3 to defray costs relating to construction of production, certain transmission, storage, pumping, and treatment facilities for water supply service, and waste water collection, conveyance, pumping, treatment, and disposal facilities; provided, however, that the city may require and accept the prepayment of connection charges whenever it shall determine that such prepayments are required in the funding of all or part of the capital costs of new utility facilities. 
(b)  All connection charges shall be paid by the user on the basis of the number of equivalent residential connections (ERC's) proposed to be connected into the water or waste water system. An ERC equates all classes of utility users to a common denominator (i.e., a detached single-family residential unit has a value of 1.0 ERC). All other types and classes of users shall be equated to this value as listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3. 
(c)  Either upon initial connection to the system, or upon each change of type or expansion of occupancy, or type of use, or nature of business, all nonresidential users, including commercial and industrial users and public facilities, shall have their ERC value redetermined based on the actual measured and recorded water consumption. The actual use shall be determined after said change occurs or after initial connection to the system and when the facility reaches the degree of occupancy, activity, or use that allows for the accurate measurement of maximum expected water consumption (as determined by the city). The actual measured water consumption shall be used as the basis for redetermining the ERC value as follows: The maximum monthly flow for a previous one-year period (converted to a daily flow value in gallons per day) shall be divided by three hundred thirty-five (335) gallons per day per ERC to derive the redetermined ERC value, which shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth (0.01) ERC. Payment of any additional water and/or wastewater connection charge, based upon the redetermined ERC value, shall be due and payable by the user within thirty (30) days after written notice of the redetermined ERC value and additional connection charge is received by the user or owner of said establishment. 
(d)  Upon each change of type or expansion of occupancy, or type of use, or nature of business, the owner of said establishment and the owner of the building or land upon which said establishment or business is situated, shall notify the department of environmental and engineering services of said change or new use or business. 
    Upon notification of the above, a redetermination will be made by the department of environment and engineering services at the earliest practicable time to ascertain the potential incremental increase in water and/or wastewater flow resulting from the change of type or expansion of occupancy, or type of use, or nature of business. An additional water and/or wastewater connection charge conforming to the connection charge schedule listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3 shall be imposed, if applicable. The charge shall extend only to the additional usage of the water and wastewater system engendered by the above-described changes. Payment of any additional water and wastewater connection charge, based upon the redetermined ERC value, shall be due and payable by the user or owner within thirty (30) days after written notice of the redetermined ERC value and additional connection charge is received by the user or owner of said establishment. 
(e)  The new connection charges set forth under paragraph (a) shall become effective on the effective date of this section and said initial connection charges under paragraph (a) shall apply to: All users issued a building permit after the effective date of this section; and all users issued a building permit prior to the effective date of this section and who have not connected to the system or become a customer within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this section. 
    Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) shall apply to all users, irrespective of the date on which they have connected to the utility system of the City of Margate. 
(f)  All monies received by the city from water and waste water connection charges, plus interest, if any, shall be deposited in a utility capital improvement account and monies shall be expended from that account only for the purposes of: 
(1)  Extending, oversizing, or constructing new additions to: 
a.  Water supply facilities; 
b.  Water and waste water treatment plants; 
c.  Waste water collection systems; 
d.  Water distribution systems; 
e.  Water and waste water pumping systems and storage facilities; 
f.  Waste water disposal facilities; 
g.  Water and waste water sludge handling and disposal facilities. 
h.  Alternative water supply facilities and wastewater reuse facilities. 
i.  Any portion of debt service associated with debt issued to finance improvements listed above. 
(2)  Engineering, legal, and administrative expenses incurred in conducting the aforementioned projects and in establishing and administering the new connection charge program. 
(g)  Failure to comply with this section shall be enforced: 
(1)  Pursuant to Section 1-8 of the City Code; 
(2)  By termination of water and/or waste water; or 
(3)  By both (1) and (2).

(c)  Matters of interpretation and definition shall rest with the city administration. 
Sample Calculation: 
Apply the following factors to the above data to obtain the appropriate connection charge for the intended use: 
Example: Assume a hospital with one hundred (100) beds. Refer to Item 13 of Table 3 to ascertain flow value. Calculate all ERC values to the nearest one-hundredth (0.01) ERC. 
Total ERC value (100 beds × 350 gpd/bed) divided by (335 gbd/ERC) = 104.48 ERCs 
    Water connection charge: 104.48 ERCs × $1,790.00 per water ERC = $187,019.20 
    Sewer connection charge: 104.48 ERCs × $1,920.00 per sewer ERC = $200,601.60 
    Total connection charges: 104.48 ERCs × $3710.00/ERC = $387,620.80

Editor's note- Ordinance No. 83-8, § 1, adopted April 6, 1983, amended § 24-73, [currently § 39-73,] by adding a new item (24) to Table 3 of said section. Inasmuch as Table 3 of § 39-73 already contains an item (24), the editor has redesignated those provisions amending Table 3 as item (24.1). 
Sec. 39-74. - Implementation of water and sewer connection charges. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the City of Margate that all water and sewer facilities which are determined by the administration to be needed to serve new and prospective users of the Margate Water and Sewer Systems shall be constructed at the cost of said new and prospective users of the Margate Water and Sewer System, except as provided herein. 
(b)  In order to implement the above-described policy of the City of Margate, those portions of the water and sewer connection charges as enacted by the city which are necessitated by the cost of new facilities for new and prospective users shall be prepaid by said users in cash at the time that said new users indicate to the city that they desire water and/or waste water plant capacity specifically built and reserved for said users. This section hereby implements the connection charge prepayment provisions of section 39-73(a) of the City Code. 
(c)  No new water and/or sewer capacity shall be approved unless allocation of water and/or sewer capacity has been requested and paid for prior to the City of Margate constructing the same, except as provided herein. 
(d)  Prepayment of connection charges shall be one thousand nine hundred twenty dollars ($1,920.00) per sewer ERC and one thousand seven hundred ninety dollars ($1,790.00) per water ERC, for a total prepayment of three thousand seven hundred ten dollars ($3,710.00) per ERC. Such connection charges shall be subject to adjustment as provided in section 39-73. 
(e)  The city commission may allocate water and sewer capacity to prospective new users who have not complied with paragraph (c) above but who pay all current appropriate charges including those in paragraph (d) above on the following terms: That any prospective user of water and/or sewer capacity within the Margate Utility Service Area, which is generally the geographic area including the City of Margate, and the portion of the City of County [Coconut] Creek south of Coconut Creek Parkway, all of which comprise the area supplied by the City of Margate with waste water and water service, which comes before the city commission of the City of Margate for a variance from the above terms showing the following: 
(1)  That they seek capacity for no more than ten (10) equivalent residential units; 
(2)  That they have never requested a variance to the above terms on any prior occasion; and, 
(3)  That they satisfy the city commission that they were not given the opportunity to participate in the reservation of capacity program before said plant capacity was built, or that hardship not of their own making existed preventing them from availing themselves of said opportunity. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the above, and upon payment of all currently applicable charges (including those contained in paragraph (d) above), the city commission may allocate more than five (5) equivalent residential units to any prospective user where it finds that the approval of the prospective new user serves a community-wide public purpose other than the construction of said project, the generation of tax revenue or the creation of employment within the City of Margate. Such finding of community-wide public purpose by the city commission includes the preservation of the integrity of the City of Margate Utility Service Area which includes the geographic area including the City of Margate and the portion of the City of Coconut Creek south of Coconut Creek Parkway, all of which comprise the area supplied by the City of Margate with waste water and water service. 
(g)  The city commission may allocate water and sewer capacity to a new user who has complied with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) above and is therefore a part of the prepayment program on the following terms: 
(1)  That the user request a variance before the city commission of the City of Margate demonstrating the following: 
a.  That the user demonstrate a hardship in that the user is unable to construct a specific development or developments without additional ERCs for water and/or sewer; 
b.  That the user demonstrate that any contemplated development or developments have been considered by the development review committee of the City of Margate for site plan review; 
c.  That the user demonstrate that the user or his predecessor in good faith underestimated its need upon joining the prepaid program; 
d.  That the user demonstrate that it has not requested a prior variance pursuant to this section. 
(2)  The city commission, with input from the administration, shall grant no more than ten (10) ERCs or an additional ten (10) per cent over and above the ERCs that an original participant/purchaser in the prepaid program had previously purchased in said program, whichever is greater, but only upon a finding that the user or its predecessor had, at the time of joining the prepaid program, reasonably anticipated prospective uses for the property which is the subject of the variance. No more than ten (10) ERCs or ten (10) per cent over the original purchase of ERCs shall be granted to any subsequent users and all subsequent users shall take subject to, and limitation of, the previous variances granted to users who are successors to the same original participant/purchaser in the program. 
    There shall be a specific finding by the administration upon the grant of every variance, pursuant to his section, that the number of ERCs granted will not exceed the anticipated treatment capacity of the plant upon peak flow with the variance granted. 
(3)  Any user granted a variance shall pay current connection fees, and all other current charges for any ERCs granted. 
(4)  That the city commission of the City of Margate may refuse to grant any variance and thus allocate additional ERCs, pursuant to this section, when it determines, based upon information supplied to it by the administration, that remaining capacity must be preserved in order to properly provide for those reservations which have been prepaid and no variance has been requested.

( Ord. No. 2013-10, § 2(24-15), 10-16-2013 ; Ord. No. 2016-16, § 1, 12-7-2016 ) 
Sec. 39-106. - Requirements. 
(a)  Cross-connection is prohibited by Rule 62-550.360, Florida Administrative Code and shall be eliminated by a backflow prevention assembly, dual check, or discontinuance of water service as allowed for in this article. Exception to elimination of the cross-connection is allowed only under subsection (e) of this section. 
(b)  A backflow prevention assembly shall be installed above-ground on each service connection to a customer's system at or near the property line, but in all cases before the first branch line leading off the service connection, wherever any of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  For all premises where the service connection pipe diameter at any locations is greater than one (1) inch. 
(2)  For all nonresidential premises. 
(3)  For premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the utility system. 
(4)  For premises having internal cross-connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross-connections exist. 
(c)  The type of backflow prevention assembly required under subsection (b) above shall be determined by the degree of hazard that exists as follows: 
(1)  For premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the utility system, the utility system shall be protected by an air gap separation or a reduced pressure principle assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include, but are not limited to, sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, and mortuaries. 
(2)  For premises where there are cross-connection that are not controlled, either actual or potential, the utility system shall be protected by an air gap separation or a reduced pressure principle assembly. 
(3)  For premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the utility system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an air gap separation or a reduced pressure principle assembly. 
(4)  For premises where, in the opinion of the director an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the director may require an air gap to protect the utility system. 
(5)  For premises with a fire service connection, defined as a service connection serving a suppression system and/or private fire hydrant(s), the utility system shall be protected by a double check valve assembly unless the director determines an alternative backflow prevention assembly is required based on the degree of hazard. 
(6)  For premises where an irrigation system alone is connected directly to the utility system through an irrigation meter, the utility system shall be protected as follows: 
a.  For an irrigation system with chemical additives or agents a reduced pressure principle assembly shall be required. 
b.  For an irrigation system not subject to paragraph (6)a. above a pressure vacuum breaker assembly shall be required. The bottom of the pressure vacuum breaker must be a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the top of the highest sprinkler head or hose bibb the pressure vacuum breaker is providing protection for. 
(7)  For all other nonresidential premises not described previously in subsection (c) the utility system shall be protected by a reduced pressure principle assembly. 
The type and size of any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be subject to the approval of the director; 
(d)  For new residential premises not subject to more restrictive requirements and where the service connection pipe diameter at all locations is one (1) inch or smaller, the utility system shall be protected by a dual check. 
(e)  All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this article but were approved devices for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained shall be excluded from the requirements of subsections 39-106(b) and 39-106(c) so long as the director is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever an existing assembly is moved from the present location, an existing assembly requires more than minimum maintenance, modifications to the existing customer system (including fire suppression system) occurs, change of type or expansion of occupancy or use occurs, the director determines the degree of hazard has changed, or when the director finds that the maintenance constitutes a health hazard, the assembly shall be replaced with the required backflow prevention assembly in accordance with this article. All existing residential service connections not subject to more restrictive requirements, where the service connection pipe diameter at all locations is one (1) inch or smaller, and installed prior to this article taking effect shall not be required to install a dual check. Whenever such a residential service connection is replaced or the water meter on the service connection is replaced or relocated a dual check shall be installed. 
( Ord. No. 2013-10, § 2(24-16), 10-16-2013 ) 
Sec. 39-107. - Authority of director and building official.

(1)  Criteria for granting. Each special permit for extended hours and each Sunday morning hours permit shall expire on September 30 of each year or upon the change in ownership or location of any permitted establishment. The City Clerk shall place all applications for such permits on the agenda for the first regular City Commission meeting to be held in September, or as soon thereafter as may be heard, and shall notify all qualified applicants of the place which their applications will be heard. 
All applications for transfer of ownership or location shall be deemed initial applications. However, applications for transfer of ownership or locations shall be automatically approved for a temporary period of thirty-five (35) days from the date of either the initial opening of an establishment serving alcoholic beverages or date transfer of ownership or location occurs. 
At the end of the thirty-five (35) days proceeding, establishments shall be prohibited from serving alcoholic beverages except by permission of the City Commission pursuant to subsections (XI)(B) and (C). 
The City Commission may grant or deny such special permits for extended hours or Sunday morning hours permit. 
The criteria which the City Commission shall consider in making a decision whether to grant or deny a special permit for extended hours to an applicant shall be as follows: 
(a)  The amount of parking demands created by the establishment being considered, especially with regard to the adverse impact on adjacent residential areas or any illegal or hazardous parking, and whether the establishment being considered meets the criteria for current parking. 
(b)  The amount and degree of law and code enforcement activities being generated by the establishment being considered, both inside and outside the location, with emphasis on vandalism, noise, vehicular use by patrons and illegal activity of any kind by employees (including municipal violations), patrons and others associated with the establishment during and immediately after the hours of operation. 
(c)  The adverse effect, if any, that the establishment will have on the neighboring properties, especially with respect to the effects of noise, parking, glare from headlights or exterior lighting on neighborhood residential properties. 
(d)  That an establishment be wholly enclosed, soundproofed and air conditioned, and any windows, doors or other openings kept closed except for normal and emergency ingress and egress, in order that noise and music emanating therefrom will not disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. 
(e)  Those criteria specified in the City Code. 
(f)  Conformance with property maintenance standards and municipal codes directly related to the establishment requesting extended hours. 
The criteria which the City Commission shall consider in making a decision whether to grant or deny a Sunday morning hours permit to an applicant shall be as follows: 
(a)  That any alcohol served on Sunday between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon shall only be served as an accompaniment to a full course meal. 
(b)  The amount and degree of law and code enforcement activities being generated by the establishment being considered, both inside and outside the location, with emphasis on vandalism, noise, vehicular use by patrons and illegal activity of any kind by employees (including municipal violations), patrons and others associated with the establishment during and immediately after the hours of operation. 
(2)  Applications. Any person, vendor or place of business which has been regularly licensed by the State of Florida to sell and dispense alcoholic beverages may apply for a special permit for extended hours. Any person, vendor or place of business which offers food service and has been regularly licensed by the State of Florida to sell and dispense alcoholic beverages with a 2COP or 4COP allocation may apply for a Sunday morning hours permit. Any person, vendor or place of business desiring a special permit for extended hours or a Sunday morning hours permit shall file with the City Clerk a typewritten or printed application on forms provided by the City. Such application, among other things, shall state the location where such business is to be conducted; the name of the applicant together with the names of the individuals operating a business under their own or under a trade name; the names of the officers or members of the firms engaged in any such business; the names of all individuals or business entities owning five (5) per cent or more of the assets of a business (excluding publicly owned corporations); the type of business license issued by the State of Florida and the number thereof. The applicant shall also furnish such other information as may be deemed reasonable by the City and shall pay the necessary license fee together with one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) application fee. No application may be deemed completed until the requirements of this paragraph are met. 
The City Commission may require, as a condition of the privilege of extending hours of operation, compliance with any reasonable conditions deemed by the commission to be necessary to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects of such extended hours. These conditions may include, without being limited to, provision by the owner or operator of the premises to provide at his expense additional off-street parking, security personnel, off-duty police personnel, screening and buffering from nearby properties. The City Commission may also require a cash bond in an amount they deem appropriate, but not in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) to ensure that the conditions which have been required are faithfully performed. No bond as provided herein will be forfeited unless a hearing before the City Commission is held and it is determined that the conditions which have been required have not been performed. 
The granting of a special permit to a particular licensee has been and continues to be a privilege subject to modification or termination by the City Commission each year at renewal time, and no person may reasonably rely on a continuation of that privilege. 
The licensee shall be deemed the owner of an establishment for which application has been made and any transfer of ownership or location shall necessitate a new application to be made pursuant to this section. Should an establishment owned by an entity transfer five (5) per cent or more of its assets, said transfer shall be deemed to be a transfer of ownership, pursuant to this section. 
(3)  Renewals. The renewal of any special permit shall be determined by the City Commission in the manner specified in subsection (2) above. Applications shall be received by July 15 of each year. Completed applications for renewal which are not received by the City Commission by July 15 of each year shall pay a fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00). 
If prior to renewal time the city administration determines that any licensee has either violated a condition of renewal or is operating in a manner harmful to the public health, safety or welfare based upon the criteria specified in subsection (2) above, it may place on the City Commission agenda the matter of revoking the special permit issued. Such agenda items shall be publicly advertised in a newspaper of local circulation, and written notice of the charges against the licensee shall be sent to him at least fourteen (14) days in advance and shall also contain the day, time and place of such agenda item. 
After consideration of the matter and allowing the licensee to be heard, the City Commission may revoke, modify or condition the special permit. The criteria to be used by the administration and City Commission in such matters shall be the criteria specified in subsection (2) above. Should the license or privilege be revoked, conditioned or modified, the licensee may seek review of such action, after three (3) months, before the City Commission. The commission may then modify or refuse to modify its action. Only one (1) such review shall be given within a twelve-month period. 
No person, vendor or distributor of any place of business licensed under the provisions of this section or by the State of Florida, or any employee thereof, shall permit any person who is not a proprietor, licensed vendor or employee thereof to remain on the licensed premises beyond the legally authorized closing hour; provided however, if said premises are divided so that the portion of said premises where alcoholic beverages are kept, stored or dispensed is segregated by partition and locked doors after the legal hour, then such prohibition shall not apply. 
(XII)  Reserved. 
(XIII)  Violations declared, prohibited; penalty. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to violate any of the provisions of this section or the state beverage laws incorporated herein; and said violation is declared to be a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as otherwise provided in the Florida Statutes.

Section 3.29. - Rooftop photovoltaic solar systems. 
(A)  Intent.

The provisions and exceptions contained herein are limited to web based applications for pre-approved rooftop photovoltaic solar system installations that utilize the Go SOLAR Broward Rooftop Solar Challenge permitting process.] 
(B)  Permitted accessory equipment. Rooftop photovoltaic solar systems shall be deemed permitted accessory equipment to structures in all zoning districts. Nothing contained in this appendix, including design standards or guidelines included or referenced herein, shall be deemed to prohibit the installation of rooftop photovoltaic solar systems as accessory equipment to conforming and nonconforming building, including buildings containing nonconforming uses.

(1)  If the property is located in a homeowner's association, condominium association, or otherwise subject to restrictive covenants, the property may be subject to additional regulations or requirements despite the issuance of a permit by the city, provided those same regulations or requirements do not infringe upon a property owner's rights as provided for in F.S. § 163.04; and 
(2)  The issuing of said permit for a rooftop photovoltaic solar system does not create in the property owner(s), its, his, her, or their successors and assigns in title, or create in the property itself a right to remain free of shadows and/or obstructions to solar energy caused by development adjoining on other property or the growth of any trees or vegetation on other property or the right to prohibit the development on or growth of any trees or vegetation on another property. 
(D)  Tree maintenance and removal.

( Ord. No. 1500.602, § 1, 8-21-2013 ) 
Section 3.30. - Reasonable accommodation procedures. 
(1)  This section implements the policy of the City of Margate for processing of requests for reasonable accommodation to its ordinances, rules, policies, and procedures for persons with disabilities as provided by the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (42 USC 3601 et seq.) (FHA) and title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 USC 12131 et seq.) (ADA). For purposes of this section, a "disabled" individual or person is an individual that qualifies as disabled and/or handicapped under the FHA and/or ADA. Any person who is disabled (or qualifying entities) may request a reasonable accommodation with respect to the City's land use or zoning laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures as provided by the FHA and the ADA pursuant to the procedures set out in this section. 
(2)  A request by an applicant for reasonable accommodation under this section shall be made in writing by completion of a reasonable accommodation request form, which form is maintained by (and shall be submitted to) the Development Services Department. The reasonable accommodation form shall contain such questions and requests for information as are necessary for processing the reasonable accommodation request. The reasonable accommodation request form shall be substantially in the form set forth in subsection (10), below. 
(3)  Should the information provided by the disabled individual to the City include medical information or records, including records indicating the medical condition, diagnosis or medical history of the disabled individual, such individual may, at the time of submitting such medical information, request that the City, to the extent allowed by law, treat such medical information as confidential information of the disabled individual. The City shall thereafter endeavor to provide written notice to the disabled individual, and/or their representative, of any request received by the City for disclosure of the medical information or documentation which the disabled individual has previously requested be treated as confidential by the City. The City will cooperate with the disabled individual, to the extent allowed by law, in actions initiated by such individual to oppose the disclosure of such medical information or documentation, but the City shall have no obligation to initiate, prosecute or pursue any such action, or to incur any legal or other expenses (whether by retention of outside counsel or allocation of internal resources) in connection therewith, and may comply with any judicial order without prior notice to the disabled individual. 
(4)  The city manager, or his/her designee, shall have the authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation, after notice and public hearing to receive comments, input and information from the public (provided, however, the city manager or designee, shall not be required to render their decision at said public hearing). When a reasonable accommodation request form has been completed and submitted to the Development Services Department, it will be referred to the city manager, or designee, for review and consideration. The city manager, or designee, shall issue a written determination within forty-five (45) days of the date of receipt of a completed application and may, in accordance with federal law, (1) grant the accommodation request, (2) grant a portion of the request and deny a portion of the request, and/or impose conditions upon the grant of the request, or (3) deny the request, in accordance with federal law. Any such denial shall be in writing and shall state the grounds therefore. All written determinations shall give notice of the right to appeal. The notice of determination shall be sent to the requesting party (i.e. he disabled individual or his/her representative) by certified mail, return receipt requested. If reasonably necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the city manager, or designee, may, prior to the end of said forty-five-day period, request additional information from the requesting party, specifying in sufficient detail what information is required. The requesting party shall have fifteen (15) days after the date of the request for additional information to provide the requested information. In the event a request for additional information is made, the forty-five-day period to issue a written determination shall no longer be applicable, and the city manager, or designee, shall issue a written determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of the additional information. If the requesting party fails to provide the requested additional information within said fifteen-day period, the city manager, or designee, shall issue a written notice advising that the requesting party had failed to timely submit the additional information and therefore the request for reasonable accommodation shall be deemed abandoned and/or withdrawn and no further action by the City with regard to said reasonable accommodation request shall be required. 
(5)  In determining whether the reasonable accommodation request shall be granted or denied, the requesting party shall be required to establish that they are protected under the FHA and/or ADA by demonstrating that they are handicapped or disabled, as defined in the FHA and/or ADA. Although the definition of disability is subject to judicial interpretation, for purposes of this ordinance the disabled individual must show: (i) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities; or (ii) a record of having such impairment; or (iii) that they are regarded as having such impairment. Next, the requesting party will have to demonstrate that the proposed accommodations being sought are reasonable and necessary to afford handicapped/disabled persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing. The foregoing (as interpreted by the courts) shall be the basis for a decision upon a reasonable accommodation request made by the city manager, or designee, or by the city commission in the event of an appeal. 
(6)  Within thirty (30) days after the city manager's, or designee's, determination on a reasonable accommodation request is mailed to the requesting party, such applicant may appeal the decision. All appeals shall contain a statement containing sufficient detail of the grounds for the appeal. Appeals shall be to the city commission who shall, after public notice and a public hearing, render a determination as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after an appeal has been filed. 
(7)  There shall be no fee imposed by the City in connection with a request for reasonable accommodation under this section or an appeal of a determination on such request to the City Commission, and the City shall have no obligation to pay a requesting party's (or an appealing party's, as applicable) attorneys' fees or costs in connection with the request, or an appeal. 
(8)  While a application for reasonable accommodation, or appeal of a determination of same, is pending before the City, the City will not enforce the subject zoning ordinance, rules, policies, and procedures against the Applicant. 
(9)  The following general provisions shall be applicable: 
(a)  The City shall display a notice in the City's public notice bulletin board (and shall maintain copies available for review in the Development Services Department, the Building Department, and the City Clerk's Office), advising the public disabled individuals (and qualifying entities) may request reasonable accommodation as provided herein. 
(b)  A disabled individual may apply for a reasonable accommodation on his/her own behalf or may be represented at all stages of the reasonable accommodation process by a person designated by the disabled individual. 
(c)  The City shall provide such assistance and accommodation as is required pursuant to FHA and ADA in connection with a disabled person's request for reasonable accommodation, including, without limitation, assistance with reading application questions, responding to questions, completing the form, filing an appeal, and appearing at a hearing, etc., to ensure the process is accessible.

Section 9.6. - Uses prohibited.

(Ord. No. 1500.560, § 14, 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 1500-563, § 1, 9-1-2010; Ord. No. 1500.578, § 3, 9-7-2011) 
Section 9.7. - Specific design standards. 
(A)  Intent. This article illustrates the types of streets, buildings, heights, and mixes of uses that create the desired "form" presented in the master plan and TOC districts. Guidelines for building design, site design, access, and other development components are transect-based with a corresponding regulating plan that prescribes the appropriate land uses, and project and site design principles relating to the appropriate form for the pedestrian orientation, streetscape, and public realm in the subject area. 
    In general, development along the corridor is able to maximize developable heights and developable volume by positioning buildings at the back of the public sidewalk. Parcels with less than two hundred (200) feet of lot depth will also find increased flexibility in achieving greater developable height and building volume while maintaining or increasing separation from adjacent residential properties located to the rear. 
    A minimum height of two (2) enclosed floors of active use is required for all new development and redevelopment in the TOC-CC City Center district. 
(B)  Building placement. The building placement regulations contained in this article assume the implementation of a one hundred fifty (150) minimum trafficways reservation width for parcels fronting the State Road 7 corridor and one hundred seventy-five (175) minimum trafficways reservation at the intersection of State Road 7 and Atlantic Boulevard as described in appendix 2, Broward County Trafficways Map Series. 
(C)  Setbacks along street frontages. The building placement regulations contained in this article assume the implementation of sidewalk improvements and associated adjustments to the State Road 7 corridor right-of-way widths and related back-of-sidewalk locations as described in subsection (O) "Streets and blocks" and Appendix 2, Broward County Trafficways Map Series Placement of future buildings is encouraged to reflect either: 
(1)  Location of back of sidewalk following street reconstruction, or 
(2)  If street reconstruction has not yet taken place, approved city plans for sidewalk reconstruction that relocate the back of sidewalk. 
    For the purposes of this article front setback is defined as the minimum permitted distance from the back-of-sidewalk line along a primary street to the primary building facade.

Section 9.11. - The Regulating Plan. 
(A)  The development regulations in this document are applied to properties within the Transit Oriented Corridor (TOC) as depicted on the Regulating Plan Map and the Official Zoning Map. The development standards and guidelines for all TOC district zones are contained in [this Article] IX. Development standards and guidelines pertain to building placement, height, frontage types, building types, use, parking, streets and blocks, and landscaping, signage and open space. 
(B)  To ensure that redevelopment activities are consistent with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and Conceptual Master Plan are realized, a series of TOC District Zones are established as the basic organizing principle for the regulations contained in this article. 
    A District Zone is an area of cohesive physical character. District Zones are organized according to criteria that influence their future urban character. Regulations controlling building placement, building height, frontage and building types, use, parking and open space standards are organized by District Zone. The City of Margate TOC District and Regulating Plan is organized into three (3) distinct Districts: 
Transit Oriented Corridor-Corridor (TOC-C) 
Transit Oriented Corridor-Gateway (TOC-G) 
Transit Oriented Corridor-City Center (TOC-CC) 
(C)  Parcels designated as Corridor typically front a primary road. Street-fronting uses are encouraged and will be supported by a redesign of the streetscape to create a highly walkable zone. Buildings are permitted up to four (4) stories, to a maximum of sixty-six (66) feet in height. A wide range of uses, buildings, and frontage types oriented to public streets is encouraged. 
(D)  Parcels designated as Gateway are located at significant entrances to the City where distinctive building elements and height to emphasize the corner, such as a corner tower, are encouraged. Buildings range from one (1) to six (6) stories, to a maximum of ninety-four (94) feet in height, provided that not more than seventy-five (75) per cent of any building elevation exceeding one hundred fifty (150) feet shall exceed four (4) stories and sixty-six (66) feet. Buildings exceeding four (4) stories and sixty-six (66) feet are subject to a minimum setback of seventy-five (75) feet from roadways classified as arterial or collector by the Broward Metropolitan Planning Organization's Federal Functional Classification Map. 
(E)  The City Center zone is intended to create a unified development plan for a high-intensity, highly walkable district with the following features: 
1.  New Main Street with ground-floor shopfronts and restaurants and on-street parking that connects to Margate Boulevard and State Road 7. 
2.  Shopfront buildings assure frequent entries and a high level of transparency into stores and restaurants. 
3.  Urban fabric with housing and/or workplace uses in buildings ranging from two (2) to eight (8) stories, to a maximum of one hundred twenty-two (122) feet in height. 
4.  Highly amenitized public realm including a public plaza, ornamental street trees, lights and public art. 
5.  The majority of parking consolidated in structures and at curbs of public streets. 
(Ord. No. 1500.560, § 48, 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 2015-1500.613, § 2, 4-15-2015 ; Ord. No. 2018-1500.645, § 9, 9-5-2018 ) 
Section 9.12. - Parking standards.

2.  Wrapped on ground level. An above-ground parking structure where nonparking uses are integrated into the ground level of the building along the parcel's primary street frontage(s). Nonparking uses are encouraged to be integrated into the building along secondary street frontages, further hiding the parking structure from view. The parking structure may be exposed to the building's street frontage(s) on upper levels. 
3.  Wrapped on all levels. An above-ground parking structure where nonparking uses are integrated into the building along the parcel's front street frontage(s) on all levels of the building. Nonparking uses are encouraged to be integrated into the building along all street frontages, further hiding the parking structure from view. 
(D)  Access. 
1.  Access to parking facilities shall be provided from alleyways, rear roads, or side streets wherever possible. Parking facilities on adjoining lots are encouraged to share access points and driveways subject to a recorded covenant running with the affected uses. 
2.  The total width of parking access openings on the ground level of structured parking may not exceed thirty (30) feet. 
(E)  Parking calculations. 
1.  Buildable density on a lot shall be determined by the sum of the actual parking calculated as that provided: (1) within the lot (2) along the parking lane corresponding to the lot frontage, and (3) by purchase or lease from a civic parking reserve within a standard pedestrian shed of a quarter (1/4) mile or one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet of the development site, if available. 
2.  Lots immediately adjacent to, or within four hundred (400) lineal feet (on the same side of a roadway) of a designated Broward County Transit stop, Margate Circulator, or other mass transit stop, shall be eligible for a parking credit. A standard transit stop shall provide a credit of two (2) per cent of required parking spaces, or no less than three (3) spaces. If the transit stop has a shelter from sun and rain, the transit stop shall provide a credit of five (5) per cent of required parking, or no less than seven (7) spaces. If a transit station no less than four hundred (400) square feet in area has been incorporated into the primary facade of a principal structure the transit station shall provide a credit of seven (7) per cent of required parking, or no less than ten (10) spaces. 
3.  In lieu of minimum parking requirements, the City may accept a one-time payment per each space of shared parking. The City Manager shall establish the amount of payment annually based on the approximate cost to build structured parking. 
4.  Minimum parking requirements are described in Article XXXIII of this Code, unless specifically provided for below. 
Residential. Residential parking requirements shall be those provided in Section 33.3 of this Code, and subject to a two and one-half (2.5) per cent parking reduction for multiple-family dwelling units within developments containing at least fifty (50) dwelling units, and a five-percent reduction for multiple-family dwelling units within developments containing at least one hundred (100) dwelling units.

Section 19.7. - General requirements and special regulations. 
(A)  Minimum size: All planned unit developments shall contain a minimum of ten (10) acres of contiguous land, unless the planning and zoning board finds that a tract which contains less than ten (10) acres, but not less than two and one-half (21/2) acres, is suitable as a PUD by virtue of some unusual conditions, in which case this minimum may be waived by the city commission upon the recommendation of the board. 
(B)  Maximum area limitations: Pursuant to more specific requirements and regulations as hereinafter prescribed, the following per centages express the maximum land area of the planned unit development that the special land use may occupy: 
    Commercial: Two (2) per cent of gross area. 
Governmental services: Five (5) per cent of gross area. (Said land shall be dedicated to the City of Margate.) 
(C)  Minimum area limitations: Planned unit developments shall contain areas at least equal to the following: 
    Open space: Thirty-five (35) per cent of gross area. 
(D)  Maximum density: The maximum gross density of residential dwelling units per acre permitted within any proposed PUD shall not exceed the combined density recommendations of the Broward County and/or Margate comprehensive land use plan over the area where a particular PUD is proposed. For the purpose of density calculations, nonresidential land uses recommended by the plan shall be considered as "low-density residential." 
    For example, consider a proposed PUD of fifty (50) acres. The recommended land uses of the comprehensive plan are: 
Acres Dwelling 
Units 
per Acre Number of 
Dwelling 
Units Low-density residential ..... 30 ×  3.9 117 Medium-density residential ..... 10 × 15.9 159 Commercial ..... 10 ×  3.9  39 Total Units 315 
     
(E)  Minimum lot area, distance between structures, frontage and setbacks: No minimum lot size shall be required within a planned unit development district. No minimum distance between structures shall be required within a planned unit development district. 
    Each dwelling unit or other permitted use shall have access to a public street, either directly or indirectly, via a private approach road, pedestrian way, court or other area dedicated by common easement guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not necessarily required to front on a dedicated road. The city shall be allowed access on privately owned roadways, easements and common open space to ensure the police and fire protection of the area, to meet emergency needs, to conduct city services, and to generally ensure the health and safety of the residents of the planned unit development. 
There are no required setbacks or yards except the following: 
There shall be a setback or yard of not less than twenty-five (25) feet in depth abutting all public road rights-of-way within or abutting a planned unit development district. 
There shall be a peripheral setback from boundary lines of the PUD of not less than twenty-five (25) feet in depth. Except for accessways, no portion of this peripheral setback may be used for parking or other vehicular use areas. 
(Ord. No. 1500.126, §§ 1, 2, 1-18-1978; Ord. No. 1500.259, § 2, 7-25-1984) 
Section 19.8. - Off-street parking and loading requirements. 
    Off-street parking and loading requirements shall not deviate from Article XXXIII of the zoning regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1500.126, §§ 1, 2, 1-18-1978) 
Section 19.9. - Landscaping requirements. 
    Landscaping shall meet or exceed the requirements of Chapter 23 of the City Code. 
(Ord. No. 1500.126, §§ 1, 2, 1-18-1978; Ord. No. 1500.259, § 3, 7-25-1984) 
Section 19.10. - Underground utilities. 
    Within the planned unit development, all utilities, including telephone, television cable, and electrical systems, shall be installed underground. Primary facilities providing service to the site may be exempted from this requirement. Large transformers shall be placed on the ground and contained within pad mounts, enclosures or vaults. The developer shall provide adequate landscaping with shrubs and plants to screen all utility facilities permitted aboveground. 
(Ord. No. 1500.126, §§ 1, 2, 1-18-1978) 
Section 19.11. - Open space requirements and computation. 
    A planned unit development shall exhibit and maintain a total open space requirement at least equal to thirty-five (35) per cent of the gross area of the PUD. The following areas qualify wholly or partially as open space: 
    If the major recreation use is concentrated in a localized section of the PUD with less than thirty (30) per cent of the residential dwelling units abutting it, only fifty (50) per cent of the area adjacent to the facility may count toward the open space requirement. 
    If, however, the major recreation use is dispersed throughout the PUD with between thirty (30) and sixty (60) per cent of the residential dwelling units abutting it, seventy-five (75) per cent of the area contained therein may count toward the open space requirement. 
    If more than sixty (60) per cent of the residential dwelling units abut the major recreation use, one hundred (100) per cent of the area contained therein may count toward the open space requirement. 
    The area occupied by a multiple-use recreation building and its attendant outdoor recreation facilities, excluding a golf course, may be included as open space. 
    Any privately maintained or owned exterior open space adjacent to and for the exclusive use by the residents of an individual dwelling unit, enclosed or partially enclosed by fences, walls, or hedges, may be considered toward meeting the total open space requirement, provided the total area contained therein does not exceed five (5) per cent of the gross area of the PUD, nor decrease the amount of ground level common open space below thirty (30) per cent of the gross area of the PUD. 
    All pervious land areas within the peripheral setback may be included. 
The area contained in public and private street rights-of-way is not considered as open space and receives no credit toward the open space requirement. All privately owned common open space shall conform to its intended use and remain as expressed in the master development plan through the inclusion in all deeds of appropriate covenants. Said deed restrictions shall run with the land and be for the benefit of present as well as future property owners. All common open space as well as public and recreation facilities shall be specifically included in the development plan schedule and be constructed and fully improved by the developer at an equivalent or greater rate than the construction of residential structures. At least once every sixty (60) days the building official shall inspect the PUD site and examine the construction which has taken place on the site. If the rate of construction of dwelling units is greater than the rate which common open space and recreational facilities have been constructed and provided, no further building permits shall be issued until the proper ratio has been provided. 
    Fifty (50) per cent of the area contained in man-made water bodies and canals with average water width of more than sixty (60) feet may be considered toward meeting the open space requirements. Man-made water bodies with average water width of less than fifty (50) feet shall not be considered toward meeting the open space requirements. 
    If the water body is natural and the shoreline vegetation will not be disturbed by the development, one hundred (100) per cent of the area contained therein may be counted as open space. 
    If the natural habitats of unique and significant value are determined to exist, the planning and zoning board may require that the area so defined be left in an undisturbed state and adequately protected or incorporated into the design of the PUD as a passive recreation area, with a minimum of improvements permitted. In either case, one hundred (100) per cent of the area contained therein may be counted as open space. 
    The area contained in a continuous open space pedestrian system, consisting of permanently maintained walks and trails not less than six (6) feet wide leading to a natural amenity, recreation facility or commercial use, offering internal pedestrian walkways that are divorced from roads and streets, may be included as open space. 
    The area contained in miniparks which may or may not be a part of the open space system, but contain at least one acre and have a minimum dimension of one hundred (100) feet together with, but not limited to, one of the following: 
    Benches; 
    Playground apparatus; 
    Barbeque pits; 
may be included as open space. 
(Ord. No. 1500.126, §§ 1, 2, 1-18-1978) 
Section 19.12. - Limitations applying to commercial uses. 
(A)  No business shall be permitted in a planned unit development until certificates of occupancy for no less than twenty-five (25) per cent of the total planned residential floor area or one hundred (100) residential dwelling units have been issued by the city. 
(B)  All business uses located within the interior of the proposed planned unit development shall be designed having no storefronts, signs or advertisements visible from outside the property line so there is no indication that the business uses are within. 
(C)  In a planned unit development having fifty (50) acres or more, business uses may be located other than in the interior of the proposed planned unit development and do not have to meet the limitations imposed on interior business uses. 
(D)  All products produced shall be for sale on the premises. 
(E)  All business activities and storage of merchandise, equipment and material shall be within an enclosed building. 
(F)  Business activities operated within a planned unit development shall not provide delivery service to locations outside the planned unit development.

    Any plans submitted as part of a petition for a planned unit development shall certify that the services of two (2) or more of the following professionals were utilized in the design or planning process, and shall state their names and businesses and addresses: 
(1)  A planner who by reason of his education and experience is qualified to become, or is a full member of the American Planning Association; and/or

Section 19.14. - Rezoning of land to PUD [classification]. 
    On application for rezoning of land to PUD classification, the planning and zoning board and the city commission shall proceed in general as for other applications for rezoning of land, giving special consideration, however, to the following matters and requirements, and allowing changes in the rezoning application prior to the required planning and zoning board public hearing in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  Prehearing conference. Upon request by the applicant, the building official, and representatives of the other city departments as required, shall meet with the applicant and/or his agent to review a general concept plan, which shall include a boundary map of the proposed PUD, the proposed pattern of land use, the proposed number and type of dwelling units and densities, proposed streets and circulation, proposed open spaces, an outline of the petition for rezoning and other plans, maps and documents deemed necessary for a prehearing conference or conferences shall be to determine that proposed development is not premature. 
    Prior to the formal submission of a petition for rezoning, the general concept plan shall be approved by the planning and zoning board as to land use, density, streets and circulation and open space, and shall thereafter be the basis for the petition for rezoning. 
    In the course of such prehearing conferences, any recommendations for changes shall be recorded in writing and shall become part of the record in the case. 
    Prehearing conferences shall be continued until a general concept plan and petition is approved by the planning and zoning board; however, approval of a general concept plan shall in no manner imply that the applicant has satisfied the conditions and requirements for rezoning. 
(2)  Public hearing: At such times as further conferences appear unnecessary, the applicant may present his formal petition and supporting data for rezoning, as set forth herein. 
    A public hearing date shall be established at the next regularly scheduled planning and zoning board meeting. Thereafter, public notice shall be given and a public hearing before the planning and zoning board on the petition for rezoning shall be held in the same manner as for other applications for rezoning, in accordance with the zoning regulations and requirements of these regulations. 
(3)  Planning and zoning board findings and recommendations: After the closing of the public hearing, the planning and zoning board may recommend by resolution to the city commission that the PUD rezoning be granted, [granted] subject to stated stipulations and conditions, or disapproved. In making its recommendation, the planning and zoning board shall find that the plans, maps, and documents submitted by the applicant and presented at the public hearing do or do not establish that the applicant has met the requirements of these regulations, and in addition: 
(a)  The requirements of unified control; 
(b)  The internal PUD standards; 
(c)  [The requirement that] the tract for the proposed PUD is suitable in terms of its relationships to the comprehensive plan and that the area surrounding the proposed development can continue to be developed in coordination and substantial compatibility with the PUD proposed, including overall dwelling unit or building density and peripheral transitions in such density; 
(d)  [The requirement] that the proposed modification of zoning or other regulations as applied to the particular case justify such modification of regulations. 
(4)  Conditions and stipulations: In recommending rezoning of land to PUD classification, the planning and zoning board may recommend, and the city commission may attach, suitable conditions, safeguards and stipulations in accord with the standards set forth in the PUD and zoning regulations. The conditions, safeguards and stipulations so made at the time of rezoning to PUD [classification] shall be binding upon the applicant or his successors in interest. Deviations from approved plans, except in the manner herein set out, or failure to comply with any requirement, condition or safeguard shall constitute a violation of these regulations. 
    It is intended that no conditions, safeguards or stipulations be required which are unreasonable; such conditions, safeguards and stipulations shall be clearly related to the intent and purposes of the zoning regulations and this article. 
(5)  City commission consideration: Upon receipt of the planning and zoning board resolution, the city commission shall schedule a public hearing to consider the rezoning petition as recommended by the board. After the requisite public notice, the commission shall act in accordance with the procedures for rezoning generally.

Section 40.12. - Boarded up buildings. 
    The city recognizes that from time to time it may be necessary to secure real property because of abandonment, disrepair, public hazard or natural disaster. Unsecured property can lead to vandalism problems, occupancy safety problems and appearance problems. The city feels it necessary to create certain criteria for securing structures. 
(1)  Real property may be secured via boarding up windows, doors, or other openings upon the requirement of the building official, fire official, code officers or by a private party provided a permit is issued by the city prior to securing a property. 
(2)  Any means of securing property including crime prevention devices shall be subject to review by the building official for safety and compliance with the building code. In no instance shall safety bars, grating, or other similar apparatus be allowed over any window, door, or other opening of any building. 
(3)  If real property in any zoning district other than an R-3 or R-3A is secured for more than thirty (30) days, except in the case of a natural disaster, the boards, panels or other means of securing structural openings shall be painted to match the exterior color of the building. 
(4)  The owner of an occupied structure shall promptly repair any broken door or window so that a temporary boarded up condition is limited. Any such repair, other than in the case of a natural disaster, shall be made within ten (10) days. 
(5)  Any device (including wood or approved hurricane shutters) used for the securing of a property during a declared hurricane or tropical storm shall be removed no later than ten (10) days after the lifting of any hurricane or tropical storm warning or watch. This provision may be suspended by the city manager in the event that the posting of any other storm warnings or watches are imminent.
