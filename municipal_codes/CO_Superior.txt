SUPPLEMENTATION 
The Superior, Colorado Municipal Code, originally published by Colorado Code Publishing Company, will be kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
Supplements to this Code provide periodic updating through the removal and replacement of pages. This inter-leaf supplementation system requires that each page which is to be removed and replaced is identified so that the updating may be accurately accomplished and historically maintained. 
Instructions for supplementation are provided for each supplement, identified by Supplement number, date and inclusive ordinance numbers. The Instructions for posting the removal and replacement of pages must be followed and accomplished in sequence, with the most recent supplementation posted last. 
When supplementation is completed and the removal and replacement of all pages are accomplished, the Instructions should be placed under the Supplementation tab, behind this page, with the most recent Instruction sheet on top. Previous Instructions should not be removed, so that the user may refer to this tab section to verify whether the code book is fully updated with all supplements included. 
The maintenance of a Municipal Code with all supplementation is an important activity which deserves close attention so that the value of the code is maintained as a fully comprehensive compilation of the legislative ordinances of the municipality. 
AMENDMENTS 
Amendments may be made to the Code by additions, revisions or deletions therefrom. Those changes may be made as follows: 
Additions: Additions may be made by ordinance to the Code as follows: 
The "SuperiorMunicipal Code" is amended by the addition thereto of a new Section 2-121, which is to read as follows: 
(Set out full section number, title and contents) 
or if the location of the new section number or numbers is undetermined, the Code may be amended as follows:

PREFACE 
The Town of Superior, a statutory town, has published its Municipal Code in a format which features the following: 
The Table of Contents is the table containing each chapter and article title, with reference to page location. Preceding each chapter is a chapter table of contents, also identifying each article by the subject name provided. 
The two-place section numbering system places the chapter number first, followed by a hyphen and section number. This two-place system is simplified by the elimination of article numbering. Each section may be cited by the chapter and section numbers which, together with reserved section numbers, are in sequence within each chapter. 
The open chapter and page numbering system creates reserved chapter and page numbers for expansion or revision of the code without undue complication when changes are made to the code by supplementation. 
The Disposition of Ordinances Table identifies the source for the contents of the code. This table provides ordinance numbers in chronological order and location by section number for the present code contents. Thus, if there is interest in determining whether an ordinance, or a portion thereof, is contained within the code, the Disposition of Ordinances Table will provide that information. The Table of Up-to-Date Pages lists all of the current pages through the most recent supplementation. 
The Index provides references by common and legal terminology to the appropriate code sections. Cross references are provided with the Index when appropriate. 
Supplements to the code provide regular updating of the code to maintain it as a current compilation of all the legislation which has general and continuing effect. Without regular supplementation, the code would soon lose its usefulness as a complete source of the general law of the municipality. Supplementation is accomplished by the periodic publication of additions and amendments to the code.

ARTICLE I - Metropolitan Districts

The policy of the Town is to reduce the proliferation of local governments and to prevent double taxation by overlapping governmental entities. The Town also recognizes that there are times when formation of a metropolitan district or a general improvement district may be appropriate to finance public improvements. The procedures are adopted to prevent problems which can occur by formation of additional governmental entities, including having indebtedness of districts affect the credit rating of the Town; preserve the financial integrity of the Town; minimize excessive tax burdens on properties within the Town; eliminate duplication of government services providers; and ensure that new districts do not dilute the control over governmental services by representatives elected by voters within the Town.

Sec. 4-3-50. - Construction materials use tax. 
(a)  Collection. The collection, administration and enforcement of the construction materials use tax shall be performed by the Treasurer. The Board of Trustees is hereby authorized to adopt rules and regulations necessary or appropriate for collection, administration and enforcement of such tax. 
(b)  Calculation. Use taxes are assessed on the cost of construction materials only. Prior to the issuance of any building permit, all use taxes shall be paid on construction materials. A receipt for the use taxes paid will be provided and should be presented upon purchase of construction materials so that the applicant will not be double-taxed for use taxes and sales taxes. Use taxes are normally established as an estimate equal to fifty percent (50%) of the total project value, and are calculated as follows: 
50% of total valuation = total cost of construction materials x 3.3% = use tax. 
For example, the use tax on a $100,000 house would equal $1,650 (50% of total valuation = $50,000 x 3.3% = $1,650). 
(c)  Audit. Use taxes paid on construction materials may be reviewed by audit of actual costs at the discretion of the Treasurer within three (3) years of the issuance of any certificate of occupancy. If additional use tax is owed, the Treasurer may issue a notice of assessment for use tax due. 
(d)  Rebate. If the fifty percent (50%) of total valuation used to calculate use taxes for a particular project is in excess of the actual cost of the materials as verified by all of the actual receipts for materials, such receipts may be submitted to the Treasurer for a determination as to whether a refund of the excess use taxes paid may be given. If an applicant intends to utilize this rebate procedure, the applicant shall notify the Treasurer of such intent upon submittal of his or her building permit application. Failure to so notify the Treasurer shall be grounds for denying a rebate request. No refund of excess use taxes paid will automatically be given. Any request for a refund must be accompanied by receipts with the applicant's name and address clearly indicated. Upon receipt of the request for a refund, complete with all receipts, the Treasurer shall submit the same to the Chief Building Official for review and a determination as to whether, in the Chief Building Official's reasonable opinion, receipts for all of the materials used have been provided.

(1)  If the applicant complies strictly with this Chapter, there is no reasonable use of the property; 
(2)  The hardship or poor land use of which the applicant complains is one suffered by the applicant alone and not by neighbors or the general public; 
(3)  The hardship claimed relates to the applicant's land, rather than personal circumstances; 
(4)  The hardship is unique and unusual or nearly so, rather than one shared by many surrounding properties; 
(5)  The hardship is not the result of the applicant's own actions; 
(6)  The variance requested is the minimum that will afford relief and the least possible modification of the requirements of this Chapter; and 
(7)  The variance will neither result in the extension of a nonconforming situation, authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use of land, nor conflict with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(d)  In granting variances, the Board of Adjustment may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties. 
(e)  A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration.

(a)  Expedited review. An eligible telecommunications facilities request shall be approved or denied by the Board of Trustees within sixty (60) days of the date of filing of the request. This time period may be tolled only by mutual agreement or where an application is incomplete. If the Board of Trustees fails to approve or deny an eligible telecommunications facilities request within sixty (60) days (plus any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The automatic approval shall become effective only upon the Town's receipt of a written notification from the applicant, after the 60-day period (plus any tolling) has expired, indicating that the application has been deemed granted. 
(b)  Application. Applicants shall only be required to submit such documentation and information as is reasonably necessary to determine whether the modification would substantially change the physical dimensions of an eligible tower or base station. If an application is incomplete, the Town shall provide written notice to the applicant within thirty (30) days, clearly and specifically identifying all missing documents or information. If the application remains incomplete after a supplemental submission, the Town shall again notify the applicant within 10 days, but second or subsequent notices of incompleteness will not require the production of documents or information that was not requested in the original notice of incompleteness.

ARTICLE III - Nonconforming Situations 

Sec. 16-3-10. - Undeveloped nonconforming lots. 
(a)  When a nonconforming lot that was in conformity with this Chapter at the time the lot was created can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except for the required lot minimums set forth in this Chapter, then the lot may be used as proposed. However, no use requiring a lot size greater than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot. 
(b)  When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all respects but the applicable setback requirements, the Manager may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if the Manager finds that: 
(1)  The property cannot reasonably be developed for any use-by-right of the zoning district without such deviations; 
(2)  These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and 
(3)  The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety. 
(c)  Adjacent nonconforming lots under the same ownership at the date they became nonconforming may not utilize this Section, nor may the successors in interest of these lots. The intent of this Section is to require undeveloped nonconforming lots to be combined with adjacent like lots to create conforming lots.

(b)  If a legal nonconforming structure is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed fifty percent (50%) of the appraised value of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only to a conforming structure or use and in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this Section. 
(c)  A legal nonconforming mobile home may be replaced by another mobile home that will fit on the existing pad and that is certified by the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. § 5401, et seq., as amended, without complying with Subsections (a) and (b) above or Paragraphs (1) through (3) of Section 16-29-10 of this Chapter. All such mobile home replacements shall require a building permit and shall comply with Paragraphs (4) and (5) of Section 16-29-10. The mobile home that was replaced shall be removed from the Town within thirty (30) days of replacement. 
(d)  For purposes of Subsections (a) and (b) above: 
(1)  The cost of renovation, repair or replacement means the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair or replacement, as reflected in the plans submitted for a building permit, or other materials supplied by the applicant, and includes the total cost of all such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of Subsections (a) or (b) above by doing such work incrementally. 
(2)  The appraised value means either the appraised market value for property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation, or the fair market value determined by a professionally recognized real estate appraiser.

(6)  Is related to the principal use and actively maintained at the same time as the principal use; and 
(7)  May include home occupations, as permitted by this Code. 
(b)  The gross floor area utilized by all accessory uses, except a private garage, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total floor area of the principal use which is active and operational. The maximum square footage of the portion of a lot used for an accessory use shall be determined based on the above criteria; however, in no event shall the square footage of the portion of the lot used for the accessory use exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the square footage of the principal use which is active and operated at the same time as the accessory use. 
(c)  There shall be no more than one (1) accessory building, unless a detached garage is an accessory use on the property, then one (1) other accessory building on the lot shall be allowed. 
(d)  Accessory uses that have a total roof area not exceeding one hundred twenty (120) square feet do not require a building permit. 
(e)  Accessory uses shall meet setback and other design standard requirements in each zone district. Construction of accessory buildings may or may not require a building permit. If such a permit is required, a plot plan showing the location of the accessory use on the zone lot shall be required.

(f)  Without limiting the generality of Subsection (a) hereof, the following activities, if they satisfy the general criteria set forth above, are specially regarded as accessory to principal residential uses: 
(1)  Offices or studios in an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature, if such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation, which is regulated separately in this Chapter. 
(2)  Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature, limited to the premises. 
(3)  Yard sales or garage sales, if such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than three (3) days (whether consecutive or not) during any ninety-day period.

(4)  There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building or premises or other visible evidence of the conduct of such home occupation. 
(5)  There shall be no exterior storage on the premises of material or equipment used as a part of the home occupation, unless it is enclosed and lot coverage requirements for accessory uses are met. 
(6)  No equipment or process shall be used which creates any glare, fumes, odors, noise or other objectionable conditions. 
(7)  No traffic shall be generated by such home occupation in greater volumes than that generated by a single-family use in a residential neighborhood, and any need for parking generated by the conduct of the home occupation shall be met off the street and not in a required yard adjacent to a street. 
(8)  Under no circumstances shall any of the following be allowed as a home occupation: any retail or wholesale shop, barbershop, beauty parlor, wig styling, mortuary, nursing home, restaurant, veterinary clinic, wood shop, cabinet-making shop, auto repair shop, motorized implement repair; dance, music or other type of instruction with more than four (4) students being instructed at one (1) time; dental offices, medical offices, the painting of vehicles, trailers or boats; welding shops; or sexually-oriented businesses.

(Ord. O-10 §1, 2010) 
ARTICLE X - Planned Developments 

Sec. 16-10-10. - Purpose. 
(a)  The Planned Development (PD), by allowing greater flexibility, is intended to be able to accommodate imaginative ideas in development and site design and to promote a greater facility for open space, more functional use of land and placement of structures in appropriate relationships to each other, to open space and to common facilities. 
(b)  A PD is permitted when it is in the best interests of the Town and will promote good design, enhancement of environmental amenities and increased efficiency of public services. 
(Ord. O-10 §1, 2010) 
Sec. 16-10-20. - General requirements. 
    Because the creation of a PD involves a particular land area and standards for development may be negotiated that are different from those set forth in the schedule of requirements for the basic zone districts in this Chapter, such different standards, as negotiated, are allowed when all of the following general and specific criteria have been met: 
(1)  Design and construction of the PD shall include adequate, safe and convenient arrangements for pedestrian circulation, roadways, driveways, off-street parking and loading space. All developments shall provide for pedestrian access from adjacent developments, open space areas and trails through the developments to border streets or open spaces and trails. 
(2)  The applicant shall clearly demonstrate the positive benefits to the Town of the PD District classification versus a traditional single district zone classification. 
(3)  The plans for the proposed PD shall indicate the particular portions of the project that the applicant intends to develop under various use categories. Densities, acreage and permitted uses shall be detailed for all development areas within the PD. A summary chart indicating development standards applicable to the entire PD or separate areas within the PD shall be required. 
(4)  The total parking requirements of the PD may exceed the sum of the parking that would be required for each separate use pursuant to Article XXIV. However, the total parking requirements may be reduced if the applicant demonstrates to the Town by using standard parking reduction ratios that the total number of spaces is not needed within the PD. 
(5)  Planned open spaces within the PD, including those spaces being used as public or private recreation sites, shall be protected by adequate covenants running with the land, or by conveyances or dedications. 
(6)  Open space percentages within separate land use areas of a PD may vary from the percentages provided in this Chapter, but the total amount of open area shall equal the total overall amount required for residential and nonresidential PDs. 
(7)  Traffic circulation shall be determined by review of each PD. The PD shall have an adequate internal street circulation system. Public streets shall serve all PD planning areas. Streets in a PD District may be designed to a standard that is different than the Town's adopted street standards, particularly in regard to width and traffic calming. Private roads may be permitted if they meet minimum construction standards and can be used by police and fire department vehicles for emergency purposes and each structure or use in the PD provides off- street loading spaces, loading berths, service courts or accesses. 
(8)  Placement of parking in attached, under-structure, underground or in structures is encouraged and shall be considered in allowing height and density increases over the limits of the basic zone districts. 
(9)  The minimum area for a PD shall be two (2) acres. 
(Ord. O-10 §1, 2010; Ord. O-4 §1(Exh. A), 2015)

(1)  In new development, internal pedestrian circulation systems, corridors and other site amenities should link and provide connections to existing and planned pedestrian trails (both regional and local) and crossing facilities. 
(2)  New development adjacent to McCaslin Boulevard is to include site improvements to facilitate linkages between internal pedestrian/bicycle circulation and pedestrian/bicycle crossings. Such crossings may be located on, above or below the grade of the public right-of-way and be designed to separate cyclists or pedestrians from motorized vehicles. 
(3)  Residential neighborhoods, business centers and adjacent developments need to be connected to strengthen the Town's sense of community and identity and to stimulate commercial synergy. Use of multiple pedestrian/bicycle and local, internal vehicular access/egress routes which minimize indirect and unnecessary travel is encouraged. Traffic calming shall be implemented on connections where cut-through traffic may negatively impact residential neighborhoods. 
(4)  Recreational hard trails shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in width, and soft trails a minimum of four (4) feet in width. Vegetation within three (3) feet of each side of the soft trail shall be maintained so that it does not encroach on the trail.

Sec. 16-19-80. - Number of signs on nonresidential properties. 
(a)  No more than four (4) signs may be erected or maintained on any nonresidential property at any time, unless the property is located on a corner and has public entrances on two (2) or more public ways, or where a building has both a front and rear public entrance, in which case one (1) additional sign may be erected. 
(b)  To determine the number of signs that may be displayed on a particular nonresidential property, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  A sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related and composed to form a unit. 
(2)  Where matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of elements, each element shall be considered a single sign. 
(3)  A multi-sided sign shall be regarded as one (1) sign if: 
a.  For a V-type sign, the two (2) sides are not separated by a distance that exceeds five (5) feet; and 
b.  For double-faced (back-to-back) signs, the distance between the backs of each face of the sign does not exceed three (3) feet.

Sec. 16-19-90. - Total sign surface area. 
(a)  Maximum surface area. The maximum sign surface area permitted for each business located on any nonresidential property shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  There may be no more than seventy-five hundredths (0.75) square feet of sign surface area per linear foot of property street frontage up to two hundred (200) feet of frontage. 
(2)  There may be up to one (1) square foot of additional sign surface area per linear foot of property street frontage in excess of two hundred (200) feet, up to a maximum of three hundred (300) square feet. 
(3)  If frontage exists on more than one (1) street, then the total sign surface area permitted for all businesses located on that property shall be the sum of the sign surface area allotments related to each street on which the property has frontage, provided that the total sign surface area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the property's total sign surface area allocation that is derived from frontage on that street. 
(4)  If a property has no street frontage and an applicant desires to install a sign oriented toward a street, then the total sign surface area permitted for all businesses located on that property is that allowed if the property boundary closest to the street toward which such sign is to be oriented fronted the street; provided that only one (1) street and the closest property boundary to such street may be used to determine the total permitted sign surface area. 
(b)  Sign area calculation. 
(1)  The surface area of a sign shall be calculated by including the entire area within a single, rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight (8) straight lines, a circle or an ellipse, enclosing the limits of the writing or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure, such as a wall or fence structure, against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
(2)  If the sign consists of more than one (1) section or module, all of the area, including that between sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign area. 
(3)  For two-sided, multi-sided or three-dimensional signs, the sign surface area shall be computed by including the total of all sides designed to attract attention or communicate information that can be seen at any one (1) time by a person from one (1) vantage point. Without otherwise limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
a.  The sign surface area of a double-faced, back-to-back sign shall be calculated by using the area of only one (1) side of such sign if the distance between the backs of such signs does not exceed three (3) feet. 
b.  The sign surface area of a double-faced sign constructed in the form of a "V" shall be calculated by using the area of only one (1) side of such sign (the larger side if there is a size difference), so long as the angle of the "V" does not exceed thirty (30) degrees and at no point does the distance between the backs of such sides exceed five (5) feet.
