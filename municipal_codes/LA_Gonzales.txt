PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the 1984 Code of the City of Gonzales, Louisiana, itself a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Gonzales of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such Ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 City of Gonzales Code, as supplemented through December 14, 2015, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the 1984 Code. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4046 , adopted Feb. 12, 2018, repealed the former div. 10, §§ 2-289.1-2-289.6, and enacted a new div. 10 as set out herein. The former div. 10 pertained to sexual harassment policy and derived from Ord. No. 2616, adopted Oct. 25, 1999. 

Sec. 2-289.1. - Statement of policy. 
    The City of Gonzales is committed to providing a work environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment in any form. It is the policy of the city to comply with all applicable laws that provide equal opportunity in employment for all persons and to prohibit unlawful discrimination in employment. The policy of the city is not to discriminate by reason of race, color, religion, sex/gender, pregnancy, genetic information, citizenship status, national origin, age, disability or veteran status. The city will comply with all applicable laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on any other factor. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to; hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation, and training. 
( Ord. No. 4046 , 2-12-18) 
Sec. 2-289.2. - Policy against unlawful discrimination/harassment and other inappropriate or unprofessional conduct. 
(a)  Work environment. The City of Gonzales insists that all individuals be treated with respect and dignity. The city expressly prohibits any form of unlawful discrimination or harassment, and will not tolerate, condone, or allow such conduct by fellow employees, supervisors, managers, customers, vendors, contractors, visitors, or others who conduct business with the city. The city's "work environment" extends to all city facilities and any setting outside the workplace where individuals who work with or for the City of Gonzales are gathered, such as business trips, meetings, conferences, and social events. 
(b)  Sexual harassment. The purpose of this policy statement on sexual harassment is to establish clearly and unequivocally that the city prohibits sexual harassment by and of its employees. No employee, either male or female, should be subjected to unsolicited or unwelcome verbal or physical sexual advances or conduct. 
    "Sexual harassment" has been defined by government agencies and the courts as conduct which includes all unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and all other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 
(1)  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; 
(2)  Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or 
(3)  Such conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and to create a hostile or abusive working environment. 
    Sexual harassment may take many forms, including, but not limited to: verbal teasing or abuse of a sexual nature; inquiries about sexual activities, sexual orientation and gender identity; subtle pressure or abuse of a sexual nature; inappropriate, unwelcome and unnecessary touching of an individual, for example, grabbing, patting, pinching, hugging, repeatedly brushing against another employee's body or impeding the movement of another person; offensive sexual flirtation, advances, or propositioning, including suggestive looks or gestures; sexually graphic verbal commentaries or jokes made in any medium; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; or the offensive display in the workplace of sexual or pornographic objects, pictures or writings. 
(c)  Racial/ethnic discrimination and harassment. The purpose of this policy statement on racial/ethnic discrimination and harassment is to establish clearly and unequivocally that the city prohibits racial and ethnic discrimination, including racial/ethnic harassment, by and of its employees. No employee, regardless of race or ethnicity, should be subjected to racially or ethnically offensive, hostile, or intimidating conduct either verbal or physical. 
    Conduct with racial or ethnic content or overtones, which is severe, pervasive or persistent, may be considered racial/ethnic harassment. Racial/ethnic harassment may take many forms, including, but not limited to: menacing behavior, words, or symbols directed at persons of a particular race or ethnicity; displaying, distributing or otherwise communicating anything offensive in any medium which focuses on race or ethnicity; making critical or mocking comments about racial or ethnic characteristics, such as voice, accent, physical features, hair texture, or manner of dress; perpetuating or promoting racial/ethnic stereotypes, such as assumptions about likes and dislikes based on race or ethnicity; assigning persons to an isolated or separate work area based on their race or ethnicity; basing overtime assignments on race or ethnicity. 
(d)  Other illegal harassment. In addition to sexual, racial, and ethnic harassment, the city recognizes that other forms of unlawful harassment exist. Such unlawful harassment may target persons because of their color, religion, gender, marital status, pregnancy, genetic information, citizenship status, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or other factors. The city will not tolerate such conduct. 
( Ord. No. 4046 , 2-12-18) 
Sec. 2-289.3. - Complaint procedure relating to any unlawful discrimination or harassment. 
    Each employee of the city is responsible for maintaining a work atmosphere free of discrimination and harassment, sexual or otherwise. Further, employees of the city are responsible for respecting the rights of their coworkers. It is the city's policy to thoroughly investigate and remedy any known incidence of unlawful discrimination or harassment. The city is equally committed to respond to complaints of inappropriate or unprofessional behavior. In order to accomplish this policy, unlawful discrimination or harassment, as well as any other inappropriate or unprofessional behavior by or toward any city employee, supervisor, manager, customer, vendor, contractor, visitor, or other person, must be reported in the manner and procedure set forth below to the extent possible. 
    Accordingly, if you experience any harassment based on your gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or other "protected classification", and/or you believe that you have been treated in an unlawful, discriminatory manner, do not ignore it. Although the city encourages you to express your concerns directly to the offending person in a reasonable and safe manner, if, in your judgment, informal, direct communications between individuals is ineffective or impossible, you should immediately or as soon as possible communicate your problem to your direct supervisor. If you feel that you are unable to report the problem to your direct supervisor for any reason, then you should report the problem to the director of human resources for the city, who will document the matter and inform the city clerk/chief administrative officer or mayor, assistant chief or police chief, or fire chief or assistant fire chief, as appropriate, who will then take appropriate action. 
    If you have a complaint involving the mayor, police chief, or fire chief, then you should report the problem to the city attorney. The city will endeavor to protect the privacy of both the complainant and the accused and to keep the investigation confidential to the extent practical and appropriate under the circumstances. 
( Ord. No. 4046 , 2-12-18) 
Sec. 2-289.4. - No retaliation. 
    The city prohibits any form of retaliation against any employee for making a bona fide complaint in good faith under this policy or for assisting in a complaint investigation. Retaliation of any kind will be considered a violation of this policy. 
( Ord. No. 4046 , 2-12-18) 
Sec. 2-289.5. - False complaints. 
    The city will not tolerate the reporting of false complaints. If, through the course of an investigation, a complaint is found to be false, the person who knowingly reported a false complaint will be the subject of disciplinary action up to and including termination and may be held liable for the resources expended in investigating a false complaint. 
( Ord. No. 4046 , 2-12-18) 
Sec. 2-289.6. - Remedial measure. 
    If unlawful discrimination, harassment, inappropriate or unprofessional conduct is found to have occurred, appropriate remedial action will be taken.

( Ord. No. 4046 , 2-12-18) 
Sec. 2-289.7. - Employee responsibility. 
    Employees have important responsibilities with respect to the policy against unlawful discrimination and harassment. City employees are responsible for knowing and understanding this policy and promoting a workplace free of unlawful discrimination and harassment by conducting themselves in a manner consistent with this policy. Employees also have a responsibility to report any unlawful discrimination or harassing conduct they are subjected to or they observe taking place toward another employee immediately or as soon as possible in accordance with the complaint procedure set forth above. 
( Ord. No. 4046 , 2-12-18) 
Sec. 2-289.8. - Contractors and vendors. 
    Contractors, vendors and others who have a business or contractual relationship with the city are expected to abide by rules of conduct expressed in the policy while doing business at or on behalf of the city.

( Ord. No. 4046 , 2-12-18) 
Sec. 2-289.9. - Policy regarding disability accommodations. 
    The city will make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities unless doing so would result in an undue hardship. If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation, you should immediately or as soon as possible communicate your circumstances to your direct supervisor. If you feel that you are unable to report the issue to your direct supervisor for any reason, then you should report to the director of human resources for the city, who will document the matter and inform the city clerk/chief administrative officer or mayor, assistant chief or police chief, or assistant fire chief or fire chief, who will then take appropriate action.

State Law reference- Flood control and related matters, R.S. 38:81 et seq. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 10-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has in R.S. 33:101 et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the mayor and city council of the city do hereby ordain as follows in this chapter. 
(Ord. of 7-21-82, § 22-1; Ord. No. 2892, 5-14-07) 
Sec. 10-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. of 7-21-82, § 22-2) 
Sec. 10-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future blight areas; and 
(7)  To insure the potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. of 7-21-82, § 22-3) 
Sec. 10-4. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one (1) per cent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) per cent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one (1) per cent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building (i) built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated flood, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (post and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building" even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures". 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see the definition of flooding). 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its extended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed wall of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or; 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pad) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 94-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages, sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure, either, (1) before the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either, (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Sec. 10-5. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. of 7-21-82, § 22-6(6)) 
Sec. 10-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base discharge would result. 
(i)  Prerequisites for granting variances are as follows: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation, to be determined on a case by case basis, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(j)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in subsections 10-34(a) through (i) are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(k)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot or more above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the local flood administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in section 10-33(b) is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one (1) foot or more above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and method of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Manufactured homes: 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to one (1) foot or more above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: (i) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one (1) foot or more above the base flood elevation; or (ii) the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(4)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: (i) Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) days; (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or (iii) meet the permit requirements of section 10-33(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in paragraph (4) of this section.

Sec. 11-81. - Definition. 
    "Hazardous waste," when used in this article, includes, but is not limited to such items as petroleum waste; paints; plastics; explosives; acids; caustics; chemicals; poisons; drugs; radioactive materials; asbestos fibers; pathogenic wastes from hospitals, sanatoriums, nursing homes, clinics, and veterinary hospitals, offal waste, and the like, which by virtue of their particular composition and inherent dangers, require handling and disposal methods different from those used in other waste materials. In the way of further explanation, "hazardous waste" is solid waste, be infectious, explosive, poisonous, caustic, or toxic, or otherwise dangerous or injurious to humans, plant or animal life. Residential solid waste normally contains some hazardous materials, but because such materials are usually present in very small quantities, their safe disposal either in a sanitary landfill or incinerator presents no special problem. Therefore, residential waste is not considered to be "hazardous waste," as used in this text.

(a)  It shall be the duty of every dealer required to make a report and pay any tax under this article to keep and preserve suitable records of the sales and purchases, or sales of services, as the case may be, taxable under this article, and such other books of account as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax due hereunder, and other information as may be required by the tax collector, and it shall be the duty of every such dealer moreover, to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all invoices and other records of goods, wares and merchandise or other subjects of taxation under this article; and all such books, invoices and other records shall be open to examination at all reasonable hours, by the tax collector or any of his duly authorized agents. 
(b)  Each dealer, as defined in this article, shall secure, maintain, and keep, for a period of three (3) years, a complete record of sales of services and tangible personal property received, used, sold, at retail, distributed, or stored, leased or rented, within this city by the dealer, together with invoices, bills of lading, and other pertinent records and papers as may be required by the tax collector for the reasonable administration of this article and all such records shall be open for inspection to the tax collector at all reasonable hours. 
(c)  In order to aid in the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this article, and to collect all of the tax imposed by this article, all wholesale dealers and jobbers in this city are hereby required to keep a record of all sales of tangible personal property made in this city, whether such sales be for cash or on terms of credit. The record required to be kept by all wholesale dealers and jobbers shall contain and include the name and address of the purchaser, the date of the purchase, the article or articles purchased and the price at which the article is sold to the purchaser. These records shall be kept for a period of three (3) years and shall be open to inspection of the tax collector or his duly authorized assistants at all reasonable hours. 
(d)  For the purpose of enforcing the collection of the tax levied by this article, the tax collector is hereby specifically authorized and empowered to examine, at all reasonable hours, the books, records and other documents of all transportation companies, agencies or firms operating in this city, whether the companies, agencies or firms conduct their business by truck, rail, water, airplane, or otherwise, in order to determine what dealers, as provided for in this article, are importing or are otherwise shipping articles of tangible personal property which are liable for said tax. If the transportation company, agency or firm shall refuse to permit such examination of its books, records and other documents by the tax collector as aforesaid, the tax collector may proceed by rule, in term or in chambers, in any court of competent jurisdiction and require the transportation company, agency or firm to show cause why the tax collector should not be permitted to examine its books, records or other documents, and in case the rule be made absolute, the same shall be considered a judgment of the court and every violation of the judgment shall be considered as a contempt thereof and punished according to law. 
(Ord. of 6-9-59, § 11) 
Sec. 18-67. - Failure to pay tax on imported tangible personal property; grounds for attachment. 
(a)  The failure of any dealer who imports tangible personal property from outside the city for use or consumption or distribution or storage to be used or consumed in this city, or who imports for lease or rental any tangible personal property subject to the provisions of this article, to pay any tax, interest, penalties or costs, under this article, shall ipso facto make the tax, interest, penalties and costs delinquent and shall be construed as an attempt to avoid the payment of same which shall be sufficient grounds for attachment of such tangible personal property wherever the same may be located or found, whether the delinquent dealer be a resident or nonresident of this city and whether the tangible personal property is in the possession of the delinquent dealer in the possession of other persons, firm, corporation or association of persons. Each importation or shipment by truck, automobile, or other means of transportation, other than a common carrier, found to be in violation of the provisions of this section shall constitute a separate offense. It is the intention of this article to prevent the disposition of the tangible personal property in order to insure payment of the tax imposed by this article together with interest, penalties and costs, and authority to attach, is hereby specifically authorized and granted to the city. The procedure prescribed by law in attachment proceedings shall be followed except that no bond shall be required of the city. 
(b)  In order to prevent the illegal importation of tangible personal property which is subject to tax into this city and to strengthen and make more effective the manner and method of enforcing payment of the tax imposed hereunder, the tax collector is hereby authorized to put into operation a system of permits whereby any person or dealer may import tangible personal property by truck, automobile, or other means of transportation other than a common carrier, without having the truck, automobile or other means of transportation seized and subjected to legal proceeding for its forfeiture. Such system of permits shall require the person or dealer who desires to import tangible personal property subject to tax imposed hereunder, to apply to the tax collector for a permit, stating the kind of vehicle to be used, the name of the driver, the license number of the vehicle, the kind or character of tangible personal property to be imported, the date, the name and address of the consignee, and such other information as the tax collector may deem proper or necessary. These permits shall be free of cost to the applicant and may be obtained at the office of the tax collector. 
(c)  The importation into this city of tangible personal property which is subject to tax, by truck, automobile, or other means of transportation other than a common carrier, without having first obtained a permit described above, (if the tax imposed by this article has not been paid), is prohibited and shall be construed as an attempt to evade payment of the tax, and the same is hereby prohibited; and the truck, automobile, or means of transportation other than common carrier, as well as the taxable property may be seized by the tax collector in order to secure the same as evidence in a trial, and it shall be subject to forfeiture and sale in the manner provided in this section. 
(d)  The tax collector is authorized in a summary proceeding, or by an action against the owner or operator of any truck, automobile or other means of transportation other than a common carrier used in the illegal importation and transportation of any article or articles of tangible personal property on which a tax is levied, by this article, and on which the tax has not been paid, to demand the forfeiture and sale of the truck, automobile or other means of transportation, together with the taxable property, used in the illegal transportation and in violation of this article. 
(e)  In all cases where it is made to appear by affidavit that the residence of the owner of the automobile, truck, or other means of transportation is out of the city, or is unknown to the tax collector, the court having jurisdiction of the proceeding shall appoint an attorney at law to represent the absent owner against whom the proceeding shall be tried contradictorily within ten (10) days after the filing of the same. The affidavit may be made by the tax collector or one of his assistants, or by the attorney representing the tax collector if it is not convenient to obtain the affidavit of the tax collector or one of his assistants. The attorney appointed to represent the absent owner may waive service and citation of the petition or rule, but he shall not waive any legal defense. If, upon the trial of the proceeding, it is established that the automobile, truck, or other means of transportation, has been used to transport any article of tangible personal property upon which a tax is levied by this article and upon which the tax has not been paid, without first having obtained a permit from the tax collector as provided herein, then the court shall render judgment accordingly, declaring the forfeiture of the taxable property and of the automobile, truck or other means of transportation and ordering the sale thereof after ten (10) days' notice by advertising in the official journal of the city. Sale shall be made at public auction at the court house to the highest bidder, for cash, and without appraisement. It is the intent and purpose of these proceedings to afford the owner of the automobile, truck or other means of transportation a fair opportunity for hearing in a court of competent jurisdiction but lack of knowledge of the violation on the part of the owner shall not be a defense. It is further the intent and purpose of these proceedings that the forfeiture and the sale of automobile, truck or other means of transportation and of the taxable property being transported therein, shall be and operate as a penalty for the violation of this article by the illegal transportation and importation of tangible personal property subject to the tax; and the payment of the tax due on the article upon which a tax is levied by this article, at the moment of seizure or thereafter, shall not operate to prevent, abate, discontinue or defeat the forfeiture and sale of the property. All funds collected from the seized and forfeited property shall be paid into the treasury of the city, and credited in the same manner as provided for the tax herein levied. The court shall fix the fee of the attorney representing the owner when appointed by the court, at a nominal sum not to exceed ten (10) percent to be taxed as costs and to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the property. 
(Ord. of 6-9-59, § 12)

Upon receipt of a sworn statement of the dealer as to the gross amount of such refunds during the period covered by such sworn statement, which person shall not be longer than ninety (90) days, the city through the tax collector shall issue to the dealer an official credit memorandum equal to the net amount remitted by the dealer for such tax collected. Such memorandum shall be accepted by the city at full face value from the dealer to whom it is issued, in the remittance of subsequent taxes accrued under the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. of 6-9-59, § 13) 
Sec. 18-69. - Tax collector to provide forms. 
    The tax collector shall design, prepare, print and furnish to dealers or make available to the dealers all necessary forms for filing returns, and instructions to insure a full collection from dealers and an accounting for the taxes due. Failure of any dealer to secure such forms shall not relieve such dealer from the payment of the taxes at the time and in the manner herein provided. 
(Ord. of 6-9-59, § 14) 
Sec. 18-70. - Method of enforcement.

The city council also finds that the number of vehicles, the improper storage of vehicles and the parking of and storage of excessive numbers of vehicles can be a nuisance and can affect the neighborhood character as well as the public health, safety and welfare, property values and the reasonable use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. The city council further finds that the establishment of these regulations furthers the goals in the Gonzales Comprehensive Plan relative to the establishment and enhancement of residential neighborhoods and similar goals. In making these findings, the city council accepts the recommendations of city staff and the planning commission that have studied the experiences of other suburban cities that have reviewed and regulated off-street parking in residential areas. The Gonzales City Council establishes these regulations as a means to balance the interests of the owners of vehicles, nearby residents and the public. 
(c)  Goals. The city council's goals in adopting this ordinance include the following: 
(1)  Preserving neighborhood character, public health, safety and welfare and property values. 
(2)  Allowing all residents a reasonable use of and a chance to enjoy their property. 
(3)  Minimizing the nuisances and the adverse effects of off-street vehicle parking through careful site design standards. 
(4)  Requiring the owners and builders of residential driveways and parking areas to design and build them to reasonable standards. 
(5)  Avoiding nuisances and potential damage to adjacent properties from off-street vehicle parking and parking areas through design standards and setback requirements. 
(d)  Off-street parking standards for single and two-family dwellings. The following standards shall apply to off-street parking for single and two-family residential properties in the R-6, R-8, R-10, R-15 zoning districts: 
(1)  Vehicle parking in the front yard setback area (the area between the front of the residential structure and the street right-of-way line) of single and two-family residences shall only be on a hard surface driveway or on improved and designated parking areas. Such a hard surface shall include bituminous, concrete, brick, gravel or crushed rock or another hard surface approved by city staff, constructed to a depth sufficient to distribute the weight of a vehicle or equipment over such area to preclude deterioration and deflection of the area due vehicle or equipment load, adverse weather, or other conditions. 
(2)  Vehicle or equipment means and includes any motor vehicle, truck, passenger motor vehicle, motor home, camper cabin, motorcycle, trailer, boat, farm machinery or similar equipment. 
(3)  The city prohibits vehicle parking or storage in the front yard on grass, unimproved areas or areas without a hard surface. 
(4)  Driveways and parking areas shall preferably be at least five (5) feet from a side property line, but no less than one (1) foot from a side property line and parking areas may cross, but shall not otherwise be in any right-of-way or on other public property. 
(5)  No owner or operator shall park a vehicle that would block a sidewalk. 
(6)  All vehicles parked or stored outside on a residential property shall not be abandoned (as defined in Chapter 19, Division 2), shall have a current license and registration and shall be in operable condition. 
(7)  The total area in the front yard setback area of a single dwelling lot improved for parking and driveway purposes shall not exceed forty (40) percent of the front yard setback area. The total area in the front yard setback area of a duplex or double-dwelling lot improved for parking and driveway purposes shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the front yard setback area. 
(8)  The city may in limited circumstances approve an increase in front yard driveway coverage, a different driveway setback or a different coverage, a different driveway setback or a different driveway surface for a single or double dwelling by administrative review. As part of such approval, the city may require the property owner or applicant to add screening such as a privacy fences, additional landscaping or other means of screening next to or around the parking area or driveway, subject to inspection and approval of city staff. Any permit considered for an increase in driveway coverage must be consistent with the original architectural design intent for the residence and keeping with the overall characteristics of the surrounding community. 
(e)  Offense. It shall be an offense for any person to park or to cause, suffer or permit the parking of a vehicle or equipment on any surface that is not an improved surface as defined in this ordinance, within any front or side yard of a single-family residence in a residential area subject to this section. It is presumed that the registered owner of the vehicle or equipment is the person who parked, caused, suffered or permitted the vehicle or equipment to be parked in violation of this ordinance. 
    The provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to special events such as family gatherings or parties. This exception is limited to twelve (12) hours. 
(f)  Penalty. Any person who violates any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Each day of violation of this article shall constitute a separate offense. 
    The city's goal is compliance. Prohibited parking complaints will be assigned to the city building official or his designee. The city building official will communicate with the violator/homeowner/resident to educate and explain the violation. They will be given the opportunity to correct the violation and advised that future violations may result in a citation and fine from the Gonzales Police Department. The preferred method to address violations of this ordinance is to contact the city building official, NOT calling 911 or the police dispatcher.

v.  The R-3-Z district generally requires four thousand (4,000) square feet. 
e.  Residential duplex (R-3-D). The residential duplex district is intended to provide for attached housing with a maximum of two (2) dwelling units per building, with the design and character of a single-family home. Structures may be divided horizontally or vertically. Duplex zoning can serve as a transition between higher density residential or commercial development and lower density single-family development. 
f.  Residential townhouse (R-3-TH). The residential townhouse district is intended to provide for attached housing on individual lots. Townhouse zoning can serve as a transition between higher density residential or commercial development and lower density single-family development. 
g.  Residential multifamily (R-3-M, R-3-E, and R-3-M25). 
1.  The residential multifamily districts are intended to accommodate a mix of housing. The districts are generally intended to provide for the integration of single-family, two-family and multifamily together. 
2.  The residential multifamily districts vary primarily on the maximum density within the district. 
i.  The R-3-M district generally allows up to fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre. 
ii.  The R-3-E district generally allows up to twenty-five (25) dwelling units per acre, with an emphasis on senior housing and services. 
iii.  The R-3-M25 district generally allows up to twenty-five (25) dwelling units per acre. 
h.  Mixed use (R-3-MU). The mixed use district is intended to promote safe, active, and pedestrian-scaled mixed use centers as part of a neighborhood. The R-3-MU district enhances the convenience, ease and enjoyment of walking, shopping and public gathering spaces. Although buildings can be exclusively residential or nonresidential in use, the vertical mixing of uses (floor-to-floor) is encouraged. 
i.  Limited business (B-1). The limited business district is intended to provide for a lower-intensity commercial zoning district for office and limited retail uses as a transition zone adjacent to residential development. 
j.  Commercial (C-1 and C-2). The commercial districts are intended to balance the need for safe, active, and pedestrian-scaled areas with the need for parking between the buildings and the street. While the commercial districts allow buildings to be built to the street edge, the district is intended to address auto-dominated corridors where it is infeasible or impractical to require buildings pulled up to the street. The primary distinction between the C-1 and C-2 districts are the intensity of commercial uses permitted. 
k.  Main street (C-MS). The main street district is intended to promote safe, active, and pedestrian-scaled mixed use streets. This district may be applied in a linear fashion along a block face or at corners of key intersections. The C-MS district should be applied where a higher degree of walkability and pedestrian activity is desired. The C-MS district allows uses to be mixed both vertically within a building or horizontally on a site. 
l.  Employment (E-1). The employment district is intended to accommodate light manufacturing, research and development, warehousing, wholesale, and retail uses. This district represents a lower-intensity alternative to the Industrial district to provide for continued employment and economic growth in Gonzales. 
m.  Industrial (I-1). The industrial district is intended to accommodate higher-intensity commercial and industrial uses that should not be located near residential areas because of their intensity or the nature of their services. 
n.  Traditional neighborhood development (TND). A traditional neighborhood development (TND) is not a single zoning district, but is a process to apply specifically tailored regulations to a tract of land for the purpose of building complete neighborhoods. The process and requirements for traditional neighborhood developments (TND) are established in section 22-6(b)(8), traditional neighborhood development (TND).

Sec. 22-3. - Use provisions. 
(22-3)(a)  Allowed uses. 
(22-3)(a)(1)  General provisions. 
a.  Use categories. 
1.  Use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate categories with other, similar uses. 
2.  Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the hours of operation, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, likely impact on surrounding properties, and site conditions. 
b.  Principal uses. Allowed principal uses by district are listed in the Allowed Use Table in section 22-3(a)(3), allowed use table. Principal uses are grouped into use categories outlined in section 22-3(b), use categories. The uses listed are not an exhaustive list. When a proposed use is not identified on the allowed use table or in section 22-3(b), use categories, the administrator may determine that the proposed use is sufficiently similar to an identified use. 
c.  Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed in conjunction with an allowed principal use as set forth in section 22-3(h), accessory uses. 
d.  Temporary uses. Temporary uses are allowed as set forth in section 22-3(i), temporary uses. 
(22-3)(a)(2)  Uses not listed. 
a.  The administrator is responsible for categorizing all uses. If a proposed use is not listed in a use category, but is similar to a listed use, the administrator may place the proposed use under that use category. 
b.  When determining whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use in section 22-3(b), use categories, the administrator will consider the following criteria: 
1.  The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use; 
2.  The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to the proposed use; 
3.  Relative amounts of sales; 
4.  The customer type; 
5.  The relative number of employees; 
6.  Hours of operation; 
7.  Building and site arrangement; 
8.  Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements; 
9.  The number of vehicle trips generated; 
10.  Signs; 
11.  How the proposed use is advertised; 
12.  The likely impact on surrounding properties; and 
13.  Whether the activity is likely to be independent of the other activities on the site. 
(22-3)(a)(3)  Allowed use table. The allowed use table establishes the uses allowed within each district and any conditions or use standards associated with each use. The allowed use table key is set forth below. 
a.  Allowed by right (¦). Use is allowed by right in the respective district subject to any use standard. Such use is also subject to all other applicable requirements of this zoning code.

Special use permits are subject to all other applicable requirements of this zoning code, including all applicable use standards. 
c.  Approved concept plan (*). Indicates a use may be allowed in the respective district only where approved by the city council as part of an approved concept plan in accordance with section 22-6(b)(8) Traditional neighborhood development (TND). Unless otherwise modified by the city council, uses allowed as part of an approved concept plan are subject to all other applicable requirements of this zoning code, including all applicable use standards.

3.  In the event that the existing vegetation has been credited and is subsequently removed or dies, it shall be replaced with the appropriate planting material. 
4.  Credit may also be permitted for existing plant material, fences and walls on abutting property, provided such items are in a permanently protected area, including, but not limited to: 
i.  A conservation easement or preserve area on adjacent property; or 
ii.  An existing utility or drainage easement exceeding one hundred (100) feet in width. 
c.  Sight distance planting. A clear sight triangle shall be established at the intersection of a driveway and a street measuring ten (10) feet from the back of the right-of-way and extending seventy (70) feet from the edge of each side of the driveway and on all corner lots (the intersection of two (2) streets) measuring twenty-five (25) feet from the corner of both sides of the intersecting streets at the back of the right-of-way. 
d.  Soils. Planting areas shall have un-compacted coarse loam that is a minimum of twelve (12) inches deep. Soils shall be appreciably free of gravel, stones, rubble or trash. All compacted soil, contaminated soil or road base fill shall be removed.

Sec. 22-5. - Master street plan. 
(22-5)(a)  General provisions. 
(22-5)(a)(1)  Purpose. The master street plan identifies the location and type of roadway facilities that are needed to meet projected growth and ensure mobility and access for the public. The objective of the master street plan is to ensure adequate right-of-way is preserved to allow for orderly and efficient roadway expansion if needed. 
(22-5)(a)(2)  Street types established. 
a.  The following street types are established, and are shown on the map in the comprehensive plan adopted on August 24, 2015, which is herein made a part of this chapter and is on file in the clerk's office: 
1.  Arterials serve major centers of metropolitan areas, provide a high degree of mobility and can also provide mobility through rural areas. Unlike their access-controlled counterparts, abutting land uses can be served directly. Forms of access include driveways to specific parcels and at-grade intersections with other roadways. 
2.  Collectors serve a critical role in the roadway network by gathering traffic from local roads and funneling them to the arterial network. Within the context of functional classification, collectors are broken down into major collectors and minor collectors. 
3.  Local roads are not intended for use in long distance travel, except at the origin or destination end of the trip, due to their provision of direct access to abutting land. Bus routes generally do not run on local roads. Local roads are often designed to discourage through traffic. As public roads, they should be accessible for public use throughout the year. 
(22-5)(a)(3)  Right-of-way requirements. 
a.  Master street plan proposed minimum widths.

(22-5.5)(b)(3)  Easements and dedication. All dedications of property to the city for public purposes shall be made formally through a written certification pursuant to R.S. 33:5051, except that, at the city discretion, the grant of an easement may be taken for the following purposes: recreational easements, conservation easements, emergency access easements, or public utility easements. All dedications in fee and grants of easements shall be free of liens and encumbrances except for those that the city, in its discretion, determines would not conflict with the intended ownership and use. 
(22-5.5)(c)  Blocks and cul-de-sacs. 
(22-5.5)(c)(1)  Block and cul-de-sac standards. 
a.  The following table establishes the maximum block perimeter and maximum cul-de-sac length by zoning district for complete blocks, partial blocks and cul-de-sacs: 
Blocks and Cul-de-Sacs Maximum Block Perimeter Maximum Cul-de-Sac Length Conservation and Agricultural Zoning Districts n/a n/a Residential Zoning Districts 3,000' 350' Mixed-Use Zoning Districts 2,400' Not allowed Commercial Zoning Districts 2,600' Not allowed

c.  Any single non-industrial block face longer than eight hundred (800) feet must include a pedestrian passage near the center of the block with a minimum servitude of fifteen (15) feet that connects two (2) streets. This servitude shall be dedicated for public use (utility, passage, etc.). In this servitude, no structure above ground level will be allowed. A paved sidewalk having a minimum of four (4) feet and a maximum of six (6) feet in width, and a minimum of four (4) inches in depth shall be required in this servitude in residential subdivisions only. 
(22-5.5)(c)(2)  Block and cul-de-sac measurements. 
a.  Generally. 
1.  The administrator may approve exemptions to the maximum block perimeter in the event that slopes in excess of twenty-five (25) percent; freeways; waterways, railroad lines; preexisting development; conservation areas, open space, and easements are determined to make the block perimeter maximum unfeasible. 
2.  A block may be broken by a civic building or open space, provided the lot is at least fifty (50) feet wide and provides pedestrian access through the lot. 
b.  Complete blocks. 
1.  A block is bounded by either a publicly-dedicated street, a private drive or private street that meets the requirements for a publicly-dedicated street. 
2.  A block perimeter is measured along the centerline of intersecting streets that encompass the block. 

c.  Partial blocks. If the scale of a proposed subdivision does not generate the need for a complete block, then street stubs may be required at certain locations to allow for future connections. 
1.  Narrow site subdivision. 
i.  As an alternative to a cul-de-sac, a subdivider may provide a street stub to serve future development. 
ii.  The street stub shall be located so that future development may connect to the street stubs in such a way as to form a block equal to or less than the maximum block perimeter allowed under section 22-5.5(c)(1) block and cul-de-sac standards. 
iii.  The depth assumed for the potential development area shall be equal to or greater than the partial block depth proposed in the subdivision. 

2.  Wide site subdivision. 
i.  As an alternative to a cul-de-sac, a subdivider may choose to provide a street stub to serve future development. 
ii.  The street stub shall be located so that future development may connect to the street stub in such a way as to form a block equal to or less than the maximum block perimeter allowed under section 22-5.5(c)(1) block and cul-de-sac standards. 
iii.  The depth assumed for the potential development area shall be equal to or greater than the partial block depth proposed in the subdivision. 

d.  Cul-de-sacs. 
1.  All cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length in accordance with section 22-5.5(c)(1) and a minimum turning radii of thirty-three (33) feet. 
2.  Cul-de-sac length is measured along the center line of the cul-de-sac from the center of the intersection to the center of the turnaround. 
3.  A cul-de-sac shall terminate with a permanent turn-around with curb treatment consistent with the street design. 
4.  The applicant shall provide for perpetual maintenance of any unpaved landscaped island through a property owners association or other acceptable organization. 
5.  The following alternatives to cul-de-sacs may be approved by the planning commission at the time of subdivision: 
i.  Eyebrow. An eyebrow is a rounded expansion of a street beyond the normal curb line. An eyebrow must have a landscaped island and is only allowed in the suburban context. 

ii.  Loop lane. A loop lane is a two-way street, no portion of which may be more than the maximum allowable cul-de-sac length from the abutting street right-of-way. The interior landscaped area must at least have an average width of seventy-five (75) feet. 

iii.  T-turnaround. If a T-turnaround is approved by the city engineer, it shall be eighty (80) feet long and twenty (20) feet wide. 
(22-5.5)(d)  Street and alley standards. 
(22-5.5)(d)(1)  Purpose. The master street plan identifies the location and type of roadway facilities that are needed to meet projected growth and ensure mobility and access for the public.

22-5.5(d)(6)  Alley standards. 
a.  An alley may serve as the primary vehicular access to a lot or building, but an alley should not provide the sole public right-of-way frontage for a parcel of land. Alleys shall only be granted in cases where access management standards deny parcel owners driveway access to existing city streets. 
b.  Alleys should connect to a public street at each end and should not terminate in permanent dead ends. In special circumstances, the city engineer may consider alleys that only intersect public streets at one (1) end. 
c.  Alleys should intersect public streets at a 90-degree angle where practical. In no case shall the intersecting angle be less than seventy-five (75) degrees as measured from centerline of intersecting street. 
d.  Alleys shall meet the following minimum requirements: 
New Commercial or Mixed Use Alleys New Residential Alleys Paved Travel Zone (minimum) 22 feet 14 feet Right-of-Way 26 feet 18 feet Minimum building setback along an alley right-of-way NA 25 feet  
e.  All alleys shall be improved by paving the full width and length of the alley right-of-way. 
f.  Alleys shall be no longer than 750 feet unless the proposed alley connects two (2) existing public streets and is approved by the city engineer. 
g.  Access is allowed to and from a fully improved alley, but on-street parking within any portion of the alley right-of-way is prohibited. "No Parking" signs are required to be installed by the developer. The signs should be located at the alley/street intersections. 
h.  Alleys shall generally be designed with an inverted crown section storm drain system. Alley runoff must be collected within a subsurface drainage system and not allowed to run off from the right-of-way. The minimum alley cross slope shall be two and one-half (21/2) percent. 
i.  Alleys shall generally be linear in design, but the city engineer may consider alleys with horizontal curves greater than two hundred (200) feet on a case-by-case basis. 
j.  All alley infrastructure including subsurface drainage within the alley right-of-way will be privately owned and maintained unless dedicated to the city by means of an approved final plat. The developer shall install signs indicating private street, no public maintenance, and the city shall have no liability for: 
1.  Maintenance of the alley pavement section. 
2.  Patrolling the alley. 
3.  Drainage of stormwater or other surface runoff from such alley onto abutting property. 
(22-5.5)(d)(7)  Street layout. 
a.  All street Intersections shall approximate right angles. 
b.  Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. 
c.  Street offsets shall be approved by the city engineer. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be prohibited. 
d.  Existing street stubs, contiguous to the subject property, shall be connected to the proposed street system. 
(22-5.5)(d)(8)  Neighborhood access. 
a.  Open access. Developments shall provide roadways that remain permanently open to the public and provide community-wide access as part of an overall connected street network. 
b.  Connections. Applicants for the subdivision of land shall be required to provide sufficient external access points to the existing or future roadway network as follows; however, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this section and section 22-5.5(c) blocks and cul-de-sacs, the provisions of section 22-5.5(c) shall control. 
1.  Any residential subdivision of greater than thirty (30) units shall include at least two (2) access points. The second access may consist of a street stub with a T-turnaround. 
2.  Any residential subdivision of greater than sixty (60) units shall include at least two (2) access points. Street stub shall not be considered part of the two (2) access points. 
3.  Residential subdivisions of one hundred (100) or more units shall provide at least three (3) separate access points. 
4.  Access points onto a state roadway require an approved permit from DOTD. 
5.  A hardship waiver of these standards may be granted by the planning commission during approval of the preliminary subdivision plat only in extreme cases where limited frontage, natural features (slope, topography, bodies of water), or similar circumstances preclude the required connections and there is no substantial impact noted regarding emergency service delivery. 
c.  Street stubs. 
1.  Street stubs into adjacent properties may be required to ensure adequate circulation. Existing street stubs, contiguous to the subject property, shall be connected to the proposed street system. 
2.  When connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required under section 22-5.5(c) blocks and cul-de-sacs, the right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the property line of the subdivided property at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. 
3.  The city engineer may require a temporary turnaround at the end of any street stub when such turnarounds appear necessary to accommodate emergency or service vehicles. No temporary street stub shall be permitted in excess of three hundred fifty (350) feet.

Amounts within such LVU ordinance utility fund will be used first to pay ordinance expenses then due and owing and second to pay any other expenditures as permitted by law consistent with the provisions of city's gas utility budget which may include, but not be limited to administrative costs, professional fees, repair and replacements to the city's gas utility, security, fire protection and such other costs and expenses as may be approved in the city's budgetary process; provided, however, each LVU's adequate assurance deposit amount shall only be deposited into the applicable LVU adequate assurance fund and invested and applied in accordance with the provisions of section 27-12. Any amounts on deposit in the LVU ordinance utility fund shall be invested in permitted investments.

(2)  In the event of a breach by LVU on any day(s), payment by LVU to city in the amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the index price and the price received by city utilizing the cover standard for the resale of such gas, adjusted for any additional transportation and related charges incurred as a result of breach by LVU (including any applicable capacity charges and/or additional charges), multiplied by the difference between the contract quantity and the quantity actually taken by LVU for such day(s) excluding any quantity for which no cover standard sale is made; and 
(3)  In the event that LVU has used commercially reasonable efforts to replace the gas or city has used commercially reasonable efforts to sell the gas to a third party, and no such replacement or sale is made for all or any portion of the contract quantity of gas, then in addition to (1) or (2) above, as applicable, the sole and exclusive remedy of the performing party with respect to the gas not replaced or sold shall be an amount equal to any unfavorable difference between the contract price and the spot price in the event of a claim by LVU for city's breach of its obligation to deliver gas, or between the index price and the spot price in the event of a claim by city for LVU's breach of its obligation to purchase gas, as adjusted for any transportation and related charges (including with respect to LVU any capacity charges and/or additional charges), multiplied by the quantity of such gas not replaced or sold. Imbalance charges shall not be recovered under this section 27-7, but city and/or LVU shall be responsible for imbalance charges, if any, as provided in section 27-8. The amount of such unfavorable difference shall be payable as provided in section 27-10.

Each LVU acknowledges and agrees that gas purchased by such LVU from city under the provisions of this chapter will be consumed by LVU at the LVU plant as provided under part 9 of each local services agreement. Upon written request by an LVU, city shall provide to LVU copies of agreements which city has executed with transporters to provide for transportation and delivery of gas under the contract with LVU to the relevant delivery point. LVU may make recommendations to city with respect to any proposed transportation arrangements providing for transportation and delivery of gas under the contract with LVU to the relevant delivery point. City and LVU shall use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate periodically and consistently with one another to discuss LVU's recommendations and other alternatives with respect to transportation and delivery of gas under the contract with LVU to the relevant delivery point. Provided, however, city, in its sole discretion, may accept or reject any such LVU recommendations or proposed transportation and delivery alternatives as city shall retain control for transporting gas to the relevant delivery point and have responsibility for transporting gas to the relevant delivery point consistent with the provisions of this section 27-8. 
In the event of an amendment, supplement, modification or termination with respect to (1) any agreement with any transporter, or (2) any agreement with city's gas suppliers which will result in any curtailment in city providing for delivery of gas under a contract with an LVU, city shall provide notice of such event to such relevant LVU. 
The parties shall coordinate with respect to city's nomination activities, giving sufficient time to meet the deadlines of the affected transporter(s). Each party shall give the other party timely prior notice, sufficient to meet the requirements of all transporter(s) involved in the transaction, of the quantities of gas to be delivered and purchased each day. Should either party become aware that actual deliveries at the delivery point are greater or lesser than the scheduled gas, such party shall promptly notify the other party. 
The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid imposition of any imbalance charges. If city receives an invoice from a transporter that includes imbalance charges with respect to a contract with an LVU, the parties shall determine the validity as well as the cause of such imbalance charges. If the imbalance charges were incurred as a result of LVU's actions or inactions, then LVU shall pay city the amount of such imbalance charges or if applicable, reimburse city for such imbalance charges paid by city.

(2)  The maximum applicable lawful interest rate.

(1)  The contract quantity under the contract for a month; and 
(2)  The ratio of the unpaid amount over the total amount billed to LVU under the contract for such month, multiplied by twenty cents ($0.20) per MMBtu. 
Provided, however, in the event that city exercises its right to set off any adequate assurance deposit amount against any amount due and owing by such LVU to city pursuant to the provisions of section 27-12, city shall assess a late payment fee in a reduced amount equal to the product of: 
(1)  The contract quantity under the contract for a month; and 
(2)  The ratio of the unpaid amount over the total amount billed to LVU under the contract for such month, multiplied by five cents ($0.05) per MMBtu.

If at any time (1) LVU or LVU's guarantor fails to make any two (2) payments within any twelve-month period on or before the applicable date for payment as provided for under a contract, or (2) LVU or LVU's guarantor has caused or permitted to occur an event of default under section 27-12 or a default under section 27-12, city may demand adequate assurance of performance which shall be an adequate assurance deposit amount equal to the adequate assurance valuation amount. Within one (1) business day after such demand is made by city to LVU, LVU shall provide adequate assurance of performance which shall be an adequate assurance deposit amount provided by LVU to city (or city's designee) in an amount equal to the adequate assurance valuation amount. 
City shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to set off against any adequate assurance deposit amount provided by LVU any amounts due and owing by such LVU under the terms of a contract including, but not limited to, any amounts due and owing by such LVU under section 27-10 and section 27-12. Within one (1) business day after city exercises its right to set off under this section 27-12 and applies funds from LVU's adequate assurance deposit amount against any amounts due and owing by such LVU under the terms of the contract, city, or a third party acting on behalf of city, shall provide notice to LVU which shall include the amount that LVU shall be required to provide to city (or its designee) so that the adequate assurance of performance shall be replenished. Within one (1) business day after receipt of such notice by LVU, LVU shall provide to city (or city's designee) the amount necessary to replenish the adequate assurance of performance as set forth in such notice provided by city to LVU. 
In the event that (1) LVU or LVU's guarantor with a minimum credit rating has provided adequate assurance of performance pursuant to section 27-12 and thereafter has made all payments under its contract on or before the applicable dates for payment for twelve (12) consecutive months, and (2) such LVU or LVU's guarantor has not caused or permitted to occur an event of default under section 27-12 or a default under section 27-12, then city shall return (or cause its designee to return) to LVU all or a portion of the adequate assurance deposit amount; provided, however, such LVU shall continue to provide and maintain adequate assurance of performance under section 27-12, including any adequate assurance deposit amount provided for under part (1) of the definition of adequate assurance of performance. In the event that LVU subsequently fails to meet the requirements of section 27-12, LVU shall again provide adequate assurance of performance in accordance with the provisions of section 27-12. City (or its designee) shall calculate adequate assurance of performance as of each valuation date and city (or its designee) shall provide LVU a statement within five (5) business days after such valuation date setting forth the adequate assurance valuation amount, the adequate assurance threshold amount, the amount of investment earnings on deposit in the relevant LVU adequate assurance fund, the undrawn portion of any letter of credit, the letter of credit valuation percentage, and the adequate assurance deposit amount. Within one (1) business day after receipt of such statement provided by city, or a third party acting on behalf of city, to LVU under the provisions of this section 27-12, LVU shall provide any additional amounts to city (or its designee) as set forth in such statement so that the adequate assurance deposit amount shall meet the requirements for adequate assurance of performance on such valuation date. To the extent city (or its designee), as of any valuation date, has on deposit amounts (including any investment earnings) in the relevant LVU adequate assurance fund, plus any adequate assurance deposit amount funded with a letter of credit from a qualified institution, in excess of adequate assurance of performance for LVU, such excess shall be returned by city (or its designee) to LVU within one (1) business day after the delivery of the applicable statement by city to LVU. 
For each adequate assurance deposit amount provided by an LVU under this chapter, city (or its designee) shall establish a separate fund or account for each LVU (each such fund or account an "LVU adequate assurance fund") within the LVU ordinance utility fund. City (or its designee) shall make deposits to each LVU adequate assurance fund, invest amounts therein and apply amounts there under consistent with the provisions of this section 27-12. City shall not deposit, invest or apply any amounts within each LVU adequate assurance fund except as provided for under the provisions of this section 27-12. Moneys contained in each LVU adequate assurance fund shall be held by city (or its designee) and shall be continuously invested and reinvested by city (or its designee) in permitted investments, to the extent practicable that shall mature (or be readily convertible to cash) not later than the respective dates, as estimated by city (or its designee), when the moneys in the relevant LVU adequate assurance fund shall be required for the purposes intended. No such investment shall be required to be made unless the cash at the time available therefor is at least equal to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). City (or its designee) shall be authorized, to the extent necessary to enable city to apply an LVU's adequate assurance of performance in accordance with the of this section 27-12, at any one (1) or more times to sell any part or all of the investments on deposit in such LVU's adequate assurance fund whenever it may, for any reason or purpose whatsoever, deem any such sale to be desirable. Any income derived from any profit or loss on any such investment of moneys on deposit in any such LVU adequate assurance fund shall be credited or debited, as the case may be, to the respective fund or account in which earned. City (or its designee) shall in no event have any liability for any loss resulting from the investment of monies in accordance with the provisions of this section 27-12. On each valuation date, city (or its designee) shall furnish LVU with a written copy of the types, amounts, yield and maturities of all such investments. Investments shall be valued by city (or its designee) as of each valuation date. 
With respect to an LVU which provides a letter of credit from a qualified institution as adequate assurance of performance, upon the occurrence of a letter of credit default, LVU shall deliver to city a substitute letter of credit from a qualified institution or other adequate assurance of performance in an amount at least equal to that of the letter of credit to be substituted on the first business day after written demand by city, with failure by LVU to provide such letter of credit to be deemed to be an event of default under section 27-12. Notwithstanding any provision of the relevant contract, the issuer of a letter of credit shall not be relieved of any liability it may have to any party resulting from the occurrence of a letter of credit default with respect to it. 
City may designate a qualified institution(s) which may act as a custodian and fiduciary on behalf of city with respect to depositing, investing and/or applying adequate assurance of performance in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In connection therewith, city may contract with such qualified institution(s) with respect to depositing, investing and/or applying adequate assurance deposit amounts in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
In the event (each an "event of default") either party (the "defaulting party") or its guarantor shall: 
(1)  Make an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; 
(2)  File a petition or otherwise commence, authorize, or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or case under any bankruptcy or similar law for the protection of creditors or have such petition filed or proceeding commenced against it; 
(3)  Otherwise become bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced); 
(4)  Be unable to pay its debts as they fall due; 
(5)  Have a receiver, provisional liquidator, conservator custodian, trustee or other similar official appointed with respect to it or substantially all of its assets; 
(6)  Fail to perform any obligation to the other party with respect to any adequate assurance of performance relating to the contract; 
(7)  With respect to LVU (or its guarantor) only, fail to provide and maintain adequate assurance of performance to city (or its designee) under section 27-12 or fail to provide, replenish and/or maintain, as applicable, any adequate assurance deposit amount to city (or its designee) under section 27-12; 
(8)  Not have paid any amount due the other party hereunder on or before the second business day following written notice that such payment is due, including a failure by city to make a payment to LVU as permitted under the provisions of section 27-6 of the chapter; 
(9)  With respect to LVU only, fail to comply with the representations and covenants set forth under part 9 to the local services agreement; 
(10)  For reasons other than (a) force majeure, (b) an event of default by LVU under this section 27-12, or (c) a default by LVU under section 27-12, with respect to city only, fail to deliver to LVU for five (5) consecutive days the contract quantity required to be delivered by city under the relevant contract for such days or fail to deliver to LVU under the relevant contract more than fifty (50) percent of the contract quantity required to be delivered by city on any particular day for fifteen (15) cumulative days during any contract year; 
(11)  For reasons other than (a) force majeure or (b) an event of default by city under this section 27-12, with respect to LVU only, fail to receive from city for five (5) consecutive days the contract quantity required to be received by LVU under the relevant contract for such days, or fail to receive from city more than fifty (50) percent of the contract quantity required to be received by LVU under the relevant contract on any particular day for fifteen (15) cumulative days during any contract year; or 
(12)  With respect to LVU (or LVU's affiliate) only, cause or permit to occur a default or event of default under other contract(s) as set forth under the provisions of part 13.11 of the local services agreement, then the other party (the "non-defaulting party") shall have the right, at its sole election, to immediately withhold and/or suspend deliveries of gas or payments upon notice and/or to terminate and liquidate the transactions under the contract (and terminate the relevant contract) in the manner provided in section 27-12, in addition to any and all other remedies available hereunder; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an event of default by an LVU described in this section 27-12, city shall immediately withhold and/or suspend deliveries of gas or payments upon notice and/or shall have the right, at its sole election, to terminate and liquidate the transactions under the contract (and terminate the relevant contract) in the manner provided in section 27-12 in addition to all the other remedies available hereunder. 
If an event of default has occurred and is continuing, the non-defaulting party shall have the right, by notice to the defaulting party, to designate a day, no earlier than the day such notice is given and no later than forty (40) days after such notice is given, as an early termination date (the "early termination date") for the liquidation and termination pursuant to section 27-12 of all transactions under such defaulting party's contract (each a "terminated transaction"). On the early termination date, all transactions under such defaulting party's contract will terminate, other than those transactions, if any, that may not be liquidated and terminated under applicable law or that are, in the reasonable opinion of the non-defaulting party, commercially impracticable to liquidate and terminate ("excluded transactions"), which excluded transactions must be liquidated and terminated as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, and upon termination each shall be a terminated transaction, and shall be valued consistent with the provisions of section 27-12. With respect to each excluded transaction, its actual termination date shall be the early termination date for purposes of this section 27-12. Except with respect to any excluded transactions which shall be liquidated and terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section 27-12 and subject to the provisions for a subsequent accounting by non-defaulting party to the defaulting party under the provisions of section 27-12, such defaulting party's contract shall also terminate on such early termination date. 
As of the early termination date, the non-defaulting party shall determine, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the amount owed (whether or not then due) by each party with respect to all gas delivered and received between the parties under terminated transactions and excluded transactions on and before the early termination date and all transportation charges and other applicable charges relating to, such deliveries and receipts (including without limitation any amounts owed under section 27-7), for which payment has not yet been made by the party that owes such payment under the applicable contract. With respect to LVU only, if LVU is the defaulting party, LVU shall reimburse city for all applicable transportation fees and charges paid or to be paid by city for the right to transport the originally agreed contract quantity to LVU's delivery point as provided for under capacity charges under Schedule 2 at the end of this chapter. 
The non-defaulting party shall net or aggregate, as appropriate, any and all amounts owing between the parties under section 27-12, so that all such amounts are netted or aggregated to a single liquidated amount payable by one (1) party to the other (the "net settlement amount"). At its sole option and without prior notice to LVU, city may set off any net settlement amount owed to city by LVU under the contract against any adequate assurance deposit amount held by city (or its designee). 
If the amount of any obligation that is to be included in any netting, aggregation or setoff pursuant to section 27-12 is unascertained, the non-defaulting party may in good faith estimate the amount of that obligation and net, aggregate or setoff, as applicable, in respect of the estimated amount, subject to the non-defaulting party accounting to the defaulting party when the amount of the obligation is ascertained. Any amount not then due which is included in any netting, aggregation or setoff pursuant to section 27-12 shall be discounted to net present value in a commercially reasonable manner determined by the non-defaulting party. 
As soon as practicable after a liquidation, notice shall be given by the non-defaulting party to the defaulting party of the net settlement amount, and whether the net settlement amount is due to or due from the non-defaulting party. The notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of the net settlement amount, provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the liquidation or give rise to any claim by the defaulting party against the non-defaulting party. The net settlement amount, as adjusted by any setoffs applied against such amount pursuant to section 27-12, shall be paid by the close of business on the second business day following such notice, which date shall not be earlier than the early termination date. Interest on any unpaid portion of the net settlement amount, as adjusted by setoffs, shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at a rate equal to the lower of: 
(1)  The then-effective prime rate of interest published under "Money Rates" by the Wall Street Journal, plus two (2) percent per annum; or 
(2)  The maximum applicable lawful interest rate. 
The non-defaulting party's remedies under this section 27-12 are the sole and exclusive remedies of the non-defaulting party with respect to the occurrence of any early termination date. Each party reserves to itself all other rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that it is or may be entitled to arising under the applicable contract. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 27-7 and section 27-12, failure by LVU to make to city when due any of the payments for which provision is made in the contract on or before the second business day following written notice that such payment is due shall constitute a default on the part of LVU. The rights and remedies of city under this section 27-12 shall be in addition and supplemental to any other rights and remedies of city under this chapter. In the event of any default described in this section 27-12, city shall have the right to recover from LVU any amount then due under the provisions of the applicable contract. In enforcement of any such right of recovery, city may bring any suit, action, or proceeding at law or in equity, including without limitation mandamus, injunction and action for specific performance, as city determines may be necessary or appropriate to enforce any covenant, agreement, or obligation to make any payment for which provision is made in the contract. Upon city withholding and/or suspending deliveries of gas consistent with the provisions of section 27-12, city thereafter shall have the right to (or cause its designee to) remarket such gas for such period of time as city in its sole discretion may determine. In the event city takes all or any of the actions authorized by this section 27-12, LVU shall remain fully liable for payment of all amounts in default and interest thereon, and shall not be relieved of any of its obligations under the contract. If city has withheld and/or suspended deliveries of gas under the provisions of this section 27-12 but has not terminated the contract, and LVU subsequently cures a default under this section 27-12 by: 
(1)  LVU providing payment in full of all amounts then due and payable under the contract; 
(2)  LVU (or its guarantor) providing adequate assurance of performance with an adequate assurance deposit amount equal to the adequate assurance valuation amount; and 
(3)  LVU (or its guarantor) agreeing to maintain adequate assurance of performance for the remaining term of the contract with an adequate assurance deposit amount equal to the adequate assurance valuation amount, city shall, within three (3) months of city receiving notice from LVU of such default under this section 27-12 being cured, either: 
(a)  Reinstate such gas deliveries to such LVU; or 
(b)  Exercise its right to terminate and liquidate the transactions under such LVU's contract (and terminate the relevant contract) in the manner provided in section 27-12. 
(Ord. No. 2928, 7-27-09) 
Sec. 27-13. - Force majeure. 
    Except with regard to a party's obligation to make payment(s) due under section 27-10 and/or section 27-12 and to pay imbalance charges due under section 27-8, neither party shall be liable to the other for failure to perform an obligation pursuant to section 27-5, to the extent such failure was caused by force majeure. The term "force majeure" as employed herein means any cause not reasonably within the control of the party claiming suspension, as further defined in section 27-13. 
Force majeure shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms or storm warnings, such as hurricanes, which result in evacuation of the affected area, floods, washouts, quick sand, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery or equipment or lines of pipe; 
(2)  Weather-related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures which cause freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe; 
(3)  Interruption and/or curtailment of firm transportation and/or storage by transporters and of non-firm transportation or storage where firm service is not available; 
(4)  Acts of others such as strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars, or acts of terror; and 
(5)  Governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order, law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or policy having the effect of law promulgated by a governmental authority having jurisdiction. City and LVU shall make reasonable efforts to avoid the adverse impacts of a force majeure and to resolve the event or occurrence once it has occurred in order to resume performance. 
Neither party to a contract shall be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of force majeure to the extent performance is affected by any or all of the following circumstances: 
(1)  The curtailment of interruptible or secondary firm transportation unless primary, in-path, firm transportation is also curtailed, or unless firm transportation service is not available from the affected transporter; or 
(2)  The party claiming excuse failed to remedy the condition and to resume the performance of such covenants or obligations with reasonable dispatch; or 
(3)  Economic hardship, to include, without limitation, city's ability to sell gas at a higher or more advantageous price than the ordinance price, LVU's ability to purchase gas at a lower or more advantageous price than the ordinance price, or a regulatory agency disallowing, in whole or in part, the pass through of costs resulting from the contract; or 
(4)  The loss of LVU's market(s) or LVU's inability to use gas purchased under the contract, except, in either case, as provided in section 27-13; or 
(5)  The loss or failure of city's gas supply or depletion of reserves, except, in either case, as provided in section 27-13; or 
(6)  Breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery within LVU's facilities, unless such incident is the result of other events listed in section 27-13. The party claiming force majeure shall not in any event be excused from its responsibility for imbalance charges. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that the settlement of strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances shall be within the sole discretion of the party experiencing such disturbance. 
The party whose performance is prevented by force majeure must provide notice to the other party. Initial notice may be given orally; however, written notice with reasonably full particulars of the event or occurrence is required as soon as reasonably possible. Upon providing written notice of force majeure to the other party, the affected party will be relieved of its obligation, from the onset of the force majeure event, to make or accept delivery of gas, as applicable, to the extent and for the duration of force majeure, and neither party shall be deemed to have failed in such obligations to the other during such occurrence or event. 
In claiming a force majeure event under this chapter, city shall not discriminate against an LVU as compared to other LVUs, and unless otherwise agreed to by LVU with respect to a force majeure event under its contract, will apply available resources and facilities to the delivery of gas to such LVU and the delivery of gas to other LVUs on at least a pro rata basis. 
The party not claiming force majeure will have the right, upon forty-five-days' notice to the party claiming force majeure (or such other notice period as agreed to by the parties), to terminate its obligations under its contract prior to the end of the delivery period without liability to either party under section 27-7 in the event of a continuing force majeure event lasting longer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; provided, however, with respect to any contract quantity to be delivered and received under the contract through the date of termination under this section 27-13, the parties shall pay all amounts owed there under and all other applicable charges relating to gas service under the contract (including any amounts owed under section 27-7). Further, LVU shall be responsible to reimburse city for all applicable transportation fees and charges paid or to be paid by city for the right to transport the originally agreed contract quantity to LVU's delivery point as provided for under capacity charges under Schedule 2 at the end of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2928, 7-27-09) 
Sec. 27-14. - Term. 
    Each contract shall remain in effect until the expiration of the latest delivery period as set forth under the respective local services agreement; provided, however, any contract may be terminated as of an early termination date in accordance with the terms and conditions under section 27-12. Further, LVU shall have the right to terminate its obligations under this contract in accordance with the provisions of section 27-5 and either party shall have the right to terminate its obligations under this contract in accordance with the provisions of section 27-8. The rights of either party to a contract pursuant to part 11 of its local services agreement, section 27-12, section 27-15, and the obligations to make all accrued payments hereunder shall survive the termination of the contract. 
(Ord. No. 2928, 7-27-09) 
Sec. 27-15. - Limitations. 
    For breach of any provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy. A party's liability under a contract shall be limited as set forth in such provision, and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived. If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly provided for under a contract, a party's liability under a contract shall be limited to direct actual damages only. Such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy, and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived. Unless expressly herein provided, neither party under a contract shall be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost profits or other business interruption damages, by statute, in tort or contract, under any indemnity provision or otherwise. It is the intent of the parties to a contract that the limitations herein imposed on remedies and the measure of damages be without regard to the cause or causes related thereto, including the negligence of any party, whether such negligence be sole, joint or concurrent, or active or passive. To the extent any damages required to be paid hereunder are liquidated, the parties to a contract acknowledge that the damages are difficult or impossible to determine, or otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy is inconvenient, and the damages calculated hereunder constitute a reasonable approximation of the harm or loss. 
(Ord. No. 2928, 7-27-09) 
Sec. 27-16. - Market disruption and price correction. 
    If a market disruption event has occurred with respect to the index price, then the replacement price shall be determined in accordance with the market disruption procedures set forth in the 1992 ISDA master agreement (multicurrency - cross border) subject to and governed by the 2000 ISDA definitions and the 2005 ISDA commodity derivatives definitions as may be amended, supplemented, updated and restated from time to time (collectively, the "definitions") as if the following elections had been made: 
(1)  The "market disruption events" specified in section 27-8 of the commodity definitions shall apply, except as otherwise specifically provided in the relevant confirmation; 
(2)  "Additional market disruption events" shall apply only if so specified in the relevant confirmation; and 
(3)  The following "disruption fallbacks" specified in section 27-8 of the commodity definitions shall apply in the following order, except as otherwise provided for in the relevant confirmation: 
(a)  Fallback reference price; 
(b)  Negotiated fallback; 
(c)  Delayed publication or announcement; 
(d)  Fallback reference dealers; and 
(e)  No fault termination. 
If a market disruption event has occurred with respect to the spot price, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a replacement price (or a method for determining the price at issue), and if the parties have not so agreed on or before the fourteenth (14 th ) business day following the first trading day on which the market disruption event occurred or existed, then the replacement price shall be determined by the majority of a panel of three independent dealers in the gas market or other recognized experts in the field of pricing natural gas. The parties shall each select one (1) dealer or other expert and the two (2) dealers or other experts selected by the parties shall mutually agree on the third dealer or expert. 
For purposes of determining the relevant prices for any day, if the index price or the spot price published is corrected no later than thirty (30) days after the original publication and the correction is published or announced by the person responsible for that publication or announcement, either party may notify the other party (1) of that correction, and (2) the amount (if any) that is payable as a result of that correction. If a party gives notice that an amount is so payable, the party that originally either received or retained such amount will, not later than three (3) business days after the effectiveness of that notice, pay, subject to any applicable conditions precedent, to the other party that amount, together with interest at the prime rate of interest published under "Money Rates" by the Wall Street Journal for the period from and including the day on which payment originally was (or was not) made to but excluding the day of payment of the refund or payment resulting from that correction. 
(Ord. No. 2928, 7-27-09) 
Sec. 27-17. - No immunity claim. 
    City warrants and covenants that, with respect to its contractual obligations under the contract, it will not claim immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or similar grounds with respect to itself or the assets of the LVU ordinance utility fund from: 
(1)  Suit; 
(2)  Jurisdiction of court; or 
(3)  Execution or enforcement of judgment.

    All ordinances and/or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed. 
(Ord. No. 2928, 7-27-09) 
Sec. 27-19. - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this ordinance shall for any reason be held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions there under. 
(Ord. No. 2928, 7-27-09) 
Sec. 27-20. - Amendments or supplements to ordinance. 
    In accordance with the provisions of Louisiana law, city may from time to time amend or supplement this chapter and the corresponding provisions of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Gonzales. Provided, however, such amendment or supplement to this chapter and the corresponding provisions of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Gonzales shall not be enforceable by city against an LVU which has executed a local services agreement prior to the effective date of such amendment/supplement, unless such LVU provides its written consent to such amendment or supplement; provided, however, that any adjustments to LVU discount and ordinance price in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 2 at the end of this chapter under the heading "Adjustments to LVU Discount and Ordinance Price" shall not require any consent by LVU. City shall provide notice to LVU of any amendment/supplement to this chapter at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date thereof. 
(Ord. No. 2928, 7-27-09) 
Sec. 27-21. - Enactment and authorization. 
    Be it ordained by the mayor and city council of the City of Gonzales, Louisiana, that the provisions of this chapter shall become and be made a party of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Gonzales, Louisiana, and the sections of this chapter may be renumbered to accomplish this intention. 
The mayor of the City of Gonzales is hereby authorized to enter into one (1) or more local services agreements with an LVU as provided in this chapter and to approve any amendments as provided in section 27-20. Other documents related to the LVU program, including but not limited to, natural gas supply agreements, gas remarketing agreements, contracts relating to the management and transportation of gas, and contracts relating to the management of the financial affairs of LVU program, may be executed by the mayor of the City of Gonzales only after the adoption of a resolution of the city council authorizing such action.

(3)  In providing for Adequate Assurance Threshold Amounts under this Schedule 1 and subject to credit review by City in connection with City's review of the applicable Gas Utility Service Application, City may, in its sole discretion, calculate Adequate Assurance Threshold Amount(s) separately under separate Service Contracts for an LVU taking into account separate sources of Gas supply. 
SCHEDULE 2 
To the Ordinance 
Monthly Rates 
    The following rates and charges shall be the Monthly Rates under Chapter 27 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Gonzales (the "Ordinance"). Capitalized terms used in this Schedule 2, and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in Chapter 27. 
    The monthly rates and charges for Gas service are set forth below and shall include charges for Gas delivered each Month in the Delivery Period based on the Ordinance Price, Capacity Charges incurred during each Month in the Delivery Period, and any Additional Charges incurred during each Month in the Delivery Period.

    Ordinance Price: For Gas delivered during each Month in the Delivery Period, the Ordinance Price under this Monthly Rate shall be determined based on the Service Option selected by LVU under the Gas Utility Service Application. The Ordinance Price shall be included under Part 4 of the Service Contract for each LVU. In the event of a Market Disruption Event, the Ordinance Price shall be determined using the replacement price for the Index Price as provided for under Section 27-16 of the Ordinance. 
    Adjustments to LVU Discount and Ordinance Price: The rates and charges for Gas service to all City customers (including Monthly Rates charged to LVUs hereunder) are reasonably calculated (i) to meet the costs associated by providing the Gas to such users and (ii) to provide for the revenue requirements of the Gas Utility of City necessary to meet the ongoing budgetary requirements of the Gas Utility of City. By further action of the Mayor and City Council of City, City, from time to time, may change its rates and charges for Gas service so that rates and charges for Gas service to all City customers (including Monthly Rates to LVUs hereunder) continue to be reasonably calculated (i) to meet the costs associated by providing the Gas to such users and (ii) to provide for the revenue requirements of the Gas utility of City necessary to meet ongoing budgetary requirements of the Gas utility of City. Consistent with the provisions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, City may from time to time adopt procedures for adjusting rates and charges (including adjustments to the LVU Discount which shall result in an adjustment to the Ordinance Price) which may include provisions for the calculation of the weighted average cost of Gas for all retail customers served by the Gas utility of City. In the event that City adjusts the LVU Discount and Ordinance Price pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, City shall provide LVU Notice of such adjustment to LVU Discount and to the Ordinance Price at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date thereof. Such adjusted LVU Discount and Ordinance Price shall be binding against LVU and City on the effective date thereof as set forth in the Notice provided by City without any further action required to be taken by City or LVU. The Capacity Charges and Additional Charges shall not be subject to adjustment or change under provisions of this paragraph but shall be determined over the term of the respective Contract in accordance with the provisions set forth below.

Chapter 28 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT: DURING CONSTRUCTION AND POST-CONSTRUCTION FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2944, adopted Feb. 22, 2010, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 28-1-28-12. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion with the concurrence of the city, these provisions have been included as §§ 28-1-28-26. 

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 28-1. - Introduction, purpose and intent. 
    During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. Clearing and grading during construction can also cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. 
    Post-construction, new developments have a tendency to increase impervious land surfaces due to the addition of hard surface roads, sidewalks and foundations, which may lead to increased volume and levels of pollutants in stormwater discharges. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment during construction and post-construction. 
    Additionally, it has been determined that proper management of construction stormwater runoff and post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum construction and post-construction stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum construction and post-construction stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of green space and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
(Ord. No. 2944, § 28-1, 2-22-10) 
Sec. 28-2. - Applicability. 
    This chapter shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (2) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one (1) or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  New development that involves the creation of one (1) acre or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one (1) acre or more; 
(2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of one (1) acre or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one (1) acre or more; 
(3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the City of Gonzales to be a hotspot land use; or 
(4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(Ord. No. 2944, § 28-2, 2-22-10) 
Sec. 28-3. - Administration. 
    The City of Gonzales shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the City of Gonzales may be delegated in writing by the superintendent of drainage to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the agency. 
(Ord. No. 2944, § 28-3, 2-22-10) 
Sec. 28-4. - Compatibility with other regulations. 
    This chapter is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(Ord. No. 2944, § 28-4, 2-22-10) 
Sec. 28-5. - Severability. 
    The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this chapter or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 2944, (§ 28-8), 2-22-10) 
Sec. 28-23. - Erosion and sediment control plan. 
    At least one (1) stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) shall be developed for each construction project or site covered by an LPDES permit. Each SWPPP shall include a description of appropriate control measures (i.e., BMPs) that will be implemented as part of the construction activity to control pollutants in stormwater discharges. An erosion and sediment control plan is minimum requirement of a SWPPP. 
    The erosion and sediment control plan shall include the following: 
(1)  Short- and long-term goals and criteria: 
a.  The construction phase erosion and sediment controls should be designed to retain sediment on-site to the maximum extent practicable. 
b.  All control measures must be properly selected, installed, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturers specifications and good engineering practices. If periodic inspections or other information indicates a control has been used inappropriately, or incorrectly, the permittee must replace or modify the control for site situations. 
c.  If sediments escape the construction site, off-site accumulations of sediment must be removed at a frequency sufficient to minimize off-site impacts (e.g., fugitive sediment in street could be washed into storm sewers by the next rain and/or pose a safety hazard to users of public streets). 
d.  Sediment must be removed from sediment traps or sedimentation ponds when design capacity has been reduced by fifty (50) percent. 
e.  Litter, construction debris, and construction chemicals exposed to stormwater shall be prevented from becoming a pollutant source for stormwater discharges (e.g., screening outfalls, picked up daily, etc.). 
f.  Off-site material storage areas (also including overburden and stockpiles of dirt, borrow areas, etc.) used solely by the permitted project are considered a part of the project and shall be addressed in the stormwater pollution prevention plan. 
(2)  Stabilization practices. The erosion and sediment control plan must include a description of interim and permanent stabilization practices for the site, including a site-specific scheduling of the implementation of the practices. Site plans should ensure that existing vegetation is preserved where attainable and that disturbed portions of the site are stabilized. Stabilization practices may include, but are not limited to: establishment of temporary vegetation, establishment of permanent vegetation, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation, and other appropriate measures. Use of impervious surfaces for stabilization should be avoided. 
The following records shall be maintained and attached to the erosion and sediment control plan: the dates when major grading activities occur; the dates when construction activities temporarily or permanently cease on a portion of the site; and the dates when stabilization measures are initiated. Except as provided in subsections a., b., and c. below, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased, but in no case more than fourteen (14) days after the construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or permanently ceased. 
a.  Where the initiation of stabilization measures by the fourteenth day after construction activity temporarily or permanently ceases, is precluded by snow cover or frozen ground conditions, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable. 
b.  Where construction activity on a portion of the site is temporarily ceased, and earth disturbing activities will be resumed within twenty-one (21) days, temporary stabilization measures do not have to be initiated on that portion of site. 
c.  In areas experiencing droughts where the initiation of stabilization measures by the fourteenth day after construction activity has temporarily or permanently ceased is precluded by seasonal arid conditions, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable. 
(3)  Structural practices. The SWPPP must include a description of structural practices to divert flows from exposed soils, store flows or otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from exposed areas of the site to the degree attainable. Such practices may include but are not limited to: silt fences, earth dikes, drainage swales, sediment traps, check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains, level spreaders, storm drain inlet protection, rock outlet protection, reinforced soil retaining systems, gabions, and temporary or permanent sediment basins. Placement of structural practices in floodplains should be avoided to the degree attainable. The installation of these devices may be subject to Section 404 of the CWA. 
Modifications to the plan shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as subsection (4) of this regulation, may be authorized by the City of Gonzales by written authorization to the permittee, and shall include: 
a.  Major amendments of the erosion and sediment control plan submitted to the City of Gonzales. 
(Ord. No. 2944, (§ 28-9), 2-22-10) 
Sec. 28-24. - Design requirements. 
(a)  Grading, erosion control practices, sediment control practices, and waterway crossings shall meet the design criteria set forth in the most recent version of the City of Gonzales reference manual and shall be adequate to prevent transportation of sediment from the site to the satisfaction of the City of Gonzales. Cut and fill slopes shall be no greater than 3:1, except as approved by the City of Gonzales to meet other community or environmental objectives. 
(b)  Clearing and grading of natural resources, such as forests and wetlands, shall not be permitted, except when in compliance with all other chapters of this chapter. Clearing techniques that retain natural vegetation and drainage patterns, as described in the City of Gonzales reference manual, shall be used to the satisfaction of the City of Gonzales. 
(c)  Clearing, except that necessary to establish sediment control devices, shall not begin until all sediment control devices have been installed and have been stabilized. 
(d)  Phasing shall be required on all sites disturbing greater than thirty (30) acres, with the size of each phase to be established at plan review and as approved by the City of Gonzales.

(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
3.2.  Restoration of public ways. If during the course of the Grantee's construction, operation, or maintenance of the Cable System there occurs a disturbance of any Public Way by the Grantee, the Grantee shall replace and restore such Public Way to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition of the Public Way existing immediately prior to such disturbance. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
3.3.  Relocation at request of the franchising authority. Upon its receipt of reasonable advance written notice, not to be less than five (5) business days, the Grantee shall protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the Public Way, as necessary, any property of the Grantee when lawfully required by the Franchising Authority by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes, or any other type of public structures or improvements which are not used to compete with the Grantee's services. The Grantee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property. If public funds are available to any Person using such Public Way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the Franchising Authority shall make application for such funds on behalf of the Grantee.

3.4.  Relocation at request of third party. The Grantee shall, on the request of any Person holding a lawful building moving permit issued by the Franchising Authority, protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from any Public Way, as necessary, any property of the Grantee, provided: (a) the expense of such is paid by said Person benefiting from the relocation, including, if required by the Grantee, making such payment in advance; and (b) the Grantee is given reasonable advance written notice to prepare for such changes. For purposes of this Section, "reasonable advance written notice" shall be no less than ten (10) business days in the event of a temporary relocation, and no less than one hundred twenty (120) days for a permanent relocation.

3.6.  Safety requirements. Construction, operation, and maintenance of the Cable System shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in substantial accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations and the National Electric Safety Code. The Cable System shall not unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of Persons or property in the Service Area. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
3.7.  Aerial and underground construction. 
A.  In those areas of the Service Area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground; provided that such facilities are actually capable of receiving the Grantee's cable and other equipment without technical degradation of the Cable System's signal quality. In those areas of the Service Area where the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications, and electric services are both aerial and underground, the Grantee shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or underground. Nothing contained in this Section shall require the Grantee to construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as Subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, network reliability units, pedestals, or other related equipment. 
B.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, in the event that all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are placed underground after the effective date of this Franchise, the Grantee shall only be required to construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if it is given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities' facilities at the time that such are placed underground. 
C.  The Franchising Authority shall provide the Grantee with written notice of the issuance of building or development permits for planned commercial/residential developments within the Service Area requiring undergrounding of cable facilities.

Such notice must be received by the Grantee at least ten (10) business days prior to availability. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
3.8.  Required extensions of service. The Grantee agrees to provide Cable Service to all residences in the Service Area, subject to the density requirements specified in this Section. Whenever the Grantee receives a request for Cable Service from a potential Subscriber in a contiguous unserved area where there are at least forty (40) residences within one (1) mile from the portion of the Grantee's trunk or distribution cable which is to be extended, the Grantee shall extend its Cable System to such Subscribers at no cost to said Subscribers for the Cable System extension, other than the applicable installation charge; provided that such extension is technically feasible, and will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of the Cable System. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the Cable System into any newly-annexed area which is not contiguous to the present Service Area of the Grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing. Grantee shall not be required to offer Cable Service to individual units of a multiple dwelling unit (MDU) facility within the Service Area unless the owner of the facility consents in writing to the following: (i) to Grantee's providing of Cable Service to individual units of the facility; (ii) to reasonable conditions and times for installation, maintenance, and inspection of the portion of the Cable System on the facility premises; (iii) to reasonable conditions promulgated by Grantee to protect Grantee's equipment and to encourage widespread use of the Cable System; and (iv) to not demand or accept payment from Grantee for permitting Grantee to provide Cable Service to the facility and to not discriminate in rental charges, or otherwise, between tenants who receive Cable Service from the Grantee and those who do not. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
3.9.  Subscriber charges for extensions of service. If a potential Subscriber resides in an area that does not meet the density requirements of Section 3.8 above, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the Cable System if the Subscribers in that area are willing to share the capital costs of extending the Cable System by making a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements. Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per mile of its trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 40. Subscribers who request service hereunder shall bear the remaining construction costs on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential Subscribers be paid in advance. Subscribers shall also be responsible for any applicable installation charges to extend the Cable System from the tap to the residence. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
3.10.  Service to public buildings. The Grantee shall, upon request, provide without charge to the Franchising Authority, one standard installation and one outlet of Basic Cable to those administrative buildings owned and occupied by the Franchising Authority, fire station(s), police station(s), and K-12 public school(s) that are passed by its Cable System. The Cable Service provided shall not be distributed beyond the originally installed outlet without authorization from the Grantee. The Cable Service provided shall not be used to distribute or sell services in or throughout such buildings or for other commercial purposes, and such outlets shall not be located in areas open to the public. The Franchising Authority shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Grantee's Cable System in any manner that results in the inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to the Cable System. The Franchising Authority shall hold the Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of Cable Service required by this Section, including but not limited to, those arising from copyright liability. The Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to said buildings or premises exceeds 125 cable feet, unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 125 cable feet. If additional outlets of Basic Cable are provided to such buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation and service fees associated therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
3.11.  Emergency use. The Grantee shall comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the FCC regarding emergency alert systems (47 C.F.R. Part 11). If the Grantee provides an Emergency Alert System ("EAS"), then the Franchising Authority shall permit only appropriately trained and authorized Persons to operate the EAS equipment and shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Grantee's Cable System in any manner that results in inappropriate use thereof, or any loss or damage to the Cable System. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law, the Franchising Authority shall hold the Grantee, its employees, officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of the Franchising Authority's use of the EAS, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
3.12.  Discrimination prohibited. Grantee shall not, because of age, race, creed, color, national origin, or sex, unlawfully (i) refuse to hire or employ, (ii) bar or discharge from employment, or (iii) discriminate against any person in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.

The Grantee shall pay to the Franchising Authority a franchise fee equal to five percent (5%) of Gross Revenues (as defined in Section 1.1 of this Franchise) received by the Grantee from the operation of the Cable System to provide Cable Services on an annual basis. The franchise fee payment shall be paid semiannually within 45 days of the end of the period for which the fee is calculated. The franchise fee payable hereunder shall be paid and received in lieu of any tax, license, charge, fee or any other character of charge for use and occupancy of the Public Ways. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report from a representative of the Grantee showing the basis for the computation. 
B.  The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three (3) years from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due.

(2)  The fee is not assessed any earlier than the tenth (10 th ) day after the due date as reflected on the Subscriber's bill; and 
(3)  The bill sets forth the amount of the fee. 
    Any fee imposed by the Grantee that does not exceed $5.00 in 2006 dollars (as adjusted annually for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index) shall be presumed reasonable to cover the costs associated with the delinquent payment. The assessment of a fee pursuant to this Section shall not be construed as a limitation on the Grantee's right to charge any other lawful fees or charges. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
4.3.  Renewal of franchise. 
A.  The Franchising Authority and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the Franchising Authority that relate to the renewal of the Grantee's Franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act. 
B.  In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626(a), the Franchising Authority agrees to notify the Grantee of all of its assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as, the past performance of the Grantee under the then-current Franchise term. The Franchising Authority further agrees that such assessments shall be provided to the Grantee promptly so that the Grantee has adequate time to submit a proposal under Section 626(b) of the Cable Act and complete renewal of the Franchise prior to expiration of its term. 
C.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section, the Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that at any time during the term of the then-current Franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to comment, the Franchising Authority and the Grantee may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then-current Franchise and the Franchising Authority may grant a renewal thereof.

(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
4.4.  Conditions of sale. 
A.  If a renewal or extension of the Grantee's Franchise is denied or the Franchise is lawfully terminated, and the Franchising Authority either lawfully acquires ownership of the Cable System or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the Cable System to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act. 
B.  The Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that in the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the Franchise, the Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity, which shall be at least 12 months, to effectuate a transfer of its Cable System to a qualified third party. Furthermore, the Grantee shall be authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior Franchise during such period. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its Cable System that is reasonably acceptable to the Franchising Authority, the Grantee and the Franchising Authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law. It is further agreed that the Grantee's continued operation of the Cable System during such period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment, of any rights of either the Franchising Authority or the Grantee. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
4.5.  Transfer of franchise. The Grantee's right, title, or interest in the Franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Grantee, without the prior consent of the Franchising Authority, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the Grantee in the Franchise or Cable System in order to secure indebtedness. Within thirty (30) days after receiving the request for transfer, the Franchising Authority shall notify the Grantee in writing of any additional information it reasonably requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee. If the Franchising Authority has not taken action on the Grantee's request for transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving such request, consent by the Franchising Authority shall be deemed given.

Such notice shall specifically reference the Section of the Franchise which is under review, so that the Grantee may organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the Franchising Authority. Alternatively, if the books and records are not easily accessible at the local office of the Grantee, the Grantee may, at its sole option, choose to pay the reasonable travel costs of the Franchising Authority's representative to view the books and records at the appropriate location. The Grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records for Franchise compliance purposes longer than three (3) years. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information that it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor disclose books and records of any affiliate. The Franchising Authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee shall not be required to provide Subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act or any comparable state law or regulation regarding the protection of Subscriber privacy.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall not indemnify the Franchising Authority for any damages, liability or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence of the Franchising Authority. The Grantee shall have the right to participate in or assume control of the defense of any such claim or action, including without limitation the right to select counsel.

The Franchising Authority shall provide the Grantee at least ten (10) days' prior written notice of such hearing, which notice shall specify the time, place and purpose of such hearing. At such hearing, the Grantee shall be provided a full and fair opportunity to be heard. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07)

A.  Seek specific performance of any provision that reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; or 
B.  Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or 
C.  In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the Franchise, seek to revoke the Franchise in accordance with Section 7.5. 
    The Grantee may appeal such determination of the Franchising Authority to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the Franchising Authority "de novo". Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the determination of the Franchising Authority. 
(Ord. No. 2893, 5-14-07) 
7.5.  Revocation. 
A.  Should the Franchising Authority seek to revoke the Franchise after complying with the procedures set forth in Sections 7.1 through 7.4 above, the Franchising Authority shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the Franchise on the basis of a pattern of noncompliance by the Grantee, including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with a material provision of the Franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee shall have ninety (90) days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the Franchising Authority has not received a satisfactory response from the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the Franchise at a public hearing. The Franchising Authority shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least thirty (30) days prior to such public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to revoke the Franchise. 
B.  At the designated hearing, the Franchising Authority shall give the Grantee a full and fair opportunity to state its position on the matter, including without limitation the right to introduce evidence, to require the production of evidence, to question witnesses, and to obtain a transcript of the proceeding, after which the Franchising Authority shall determine whether or not the Franchise shall be revoked. 
C.  The Franchising Authority may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action that it deems appropriate to enforce the Franchising Authority's rights under the Franchise in lieu of revocation of the Franchise. 
D.  The Grantee may appeal any determination of the Franchising Authority to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the Franchising Authority "de novo".

7.6.  Force Majeure. 
A.  The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default (including termination, cancellation or revocation of the Franchise), where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by strike, riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow storm, hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic act of nature, labor disputes, governmental, administrative or judicial order or regulation or other circumstances reasonably beyond the Grantee's ability to anticipate and control. This provision includes work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles to which the Grantee's Cable System is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. 
B.  Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the Franchising Authority's intention to subject the Grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the Franchise for so-called "technical" breach(es) or violation(s) of the Franchise, which shall include but are not limited to the following: (i) in instances or for matters where a violation or a breach by the Grantee of the Franchise was good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the customers within the Service Area; or (ii) where strict performance with the terms of the Franchise would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the Grantee that outweigh the benefit to be derived by the Franchising Authority and/or Subscribers.
