PREFACE 
    This volume is a republication of the Code of Ordinances of Monroeville, Alabama, of 1977, including all general and permanent ordinances enacted by the City Council through Ordinance No. 2019-01-002, adopted January 8, 2019. 
    The 1997 Code constituted a complete codification of the ordinances of Monroeville, Alabama of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note which appears in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate all laws and ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the eleventh section of Chapter 7 is 7-11. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-3 and 4-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-3.1, 4-3.2, 4-3.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of each chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this republication is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Index 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings; some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Acknowledgments 
    The republication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Tassy Spinks, Vice President of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to all city officers and employees for their supervision, cooperation and interest during the preparation of this Code.

Sec. 1-6. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-7. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful to change or amend by addition or deletion, any part of this Code or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with this Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. 
Sec. 1-8. - Violations-General penalty; continuing offense. 
    Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city an act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance shall be punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00); and in addition may be punishable by imprisonment or hard labor for the city, or a combination thereof, for a period not exceeding six (6) months, unless otherwise provided by section 7-1(3) of this Code. Each day's violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 9-6-83) 
Cross reference- Penalty for violating state law, §§ 7-1, 14-1(b); penalty for violating city ordinances, § 7-2. 
State Law reference- Authority of city to enforce obedience to ordinances by fine not exceeding $200.00 and by imprisonment or hard labor not exceeding 6 months, or both, Code of Ala., Tit. 37, § 455; punishment for violation of statute to be same as provided in the statute, Tit. 37, § 595; women may not be sentenced to work on the streets, Tit. 37, § 463; however, in the case of Fondren v. Jasper, 39 Ala. App. 593, 105 So. (2d) 735, the holding was that this section did not prevent a woman from being sentenced to hard labor. 
Sec. 1-9. - Same-Orders, rules and regulations adopted. 
    Any person who shall violate, or fail, neglect or refuse to comply with any lawful order of any lawful officer of the city made in pursuance of and under his authority as such officer, or who shall violate, or shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with any of the rules and regulations or laws adopted by this Code, shall be guilty of an offense; provided, however, the provisions of this section shall not apply to violations of official duty imposed by this Code upon officers or employees of the city as such, unless the provision imposing the duty also expressly makes the violation thereof unlawful or punishable. 
Sec. 1-10. - Corporate limits. 
    The corporate limits and boundaries of the city shall be as shown on the land use map, and on ordinances describing the city and annexing territory to the city, copies of which are on file in the office of the city clerk.

Sec. 2.5-21. - Purposes. 
(a)  The main purpose of this article is to reduce or eliminate the incidents of false alarms in the City of Monroeville, Alabama. While alarm systems provide a vital service to residents, businesses and the entire city, false fire alarms pose a safety hazard. They divert municipal employees from useful duties, causing a waste of municipal manpower and services. 
(b)  The purpose of this article is to encourage alarm users and alarm businesses (sales, installation, customer service and/or monitoring) to properly maintain and operate alarm systems within the city by limiting unnecessary municipal department responses to false fire alarms. 
(c)  This article governs local alarm systems by providing for penalties for violation of this article along with enforcement procedures. 
(Ord. of 4-21-98, Art. I) 
Sec. 2.5-22. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, as used in this article, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:] 
    Automatic telephone dialing device or digital alarm communicator alarm system means an alarm system which is activated by a signal or message and which automatically sends a prerecorded voice message or coded signal by microwave, telephone lines, or other mode of transmittal directly to the county 911 line or directly to the police or fire department, indicating the existence of an emergency situation that the alarm system is designated to detect. 
    False fire alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or the negligent or intentional misuse of the alarm system by the fire alarm user or an employee whereby the fire or medical emergency does not in fact exist. False fire alarm does not include an alarm signal caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm business operator or alarm user. Alarms resulting from the following conditions are not considered false fire alarms: 
(1)  Earthquake causing structural damage to the protected premises. 
(2)  Flooding of the protected premises due to overflow or natural drainage. 
(3)  Lightning bolt causing physical damage to the protected premises. 
(4)  Telephone line malfunction verified in writing to the city by at least a first line telephone company supervisor or by fire department personnel on the scene of an alarm. 
(5)  Notification of the fire department before a unit is dispatched to investigate; that the alarm does not require a response. 
(6)  An alarm call on the mistaken belief that a fire or medical emergency exists. 
    Fire alarm system means any mechanical, electrical or radio controlled device which is arranged, designed, or used to signal the occurrence in the city of a fire or medical emergency requiring urgent attention, and to which fire or medical emergency personnel are expected to respond. Fire alarm systems include those through which public safety personnel are notified directly of such signals through central monitoring stations or are notified indirectly by way of third persons who monitor the alarm systems and who reports such signals to the fire department. Fire alarm systems also include those designed to register a signal which is audible, visible, or in other ways perceptible outside of a protected building, structure or facility as to notify persons in the neighborhood beyond the zoning lot where the signal is located who in turn may notify the fire department of the signal. 
    Fire alarm user means the individual, including but not limited to any person, firm, corporation, partnership or any other entity who purchases, leases, contracts for, or obtains a fire or medical alarm system. 
(Ord. of 4-21-98, Art. II, § 1) 
Sec. 2.5-23. - Liability of city. 
    The city and any of its agents and employees shall have no liability or responsibility for the operation or effectiveness of any alarm system and shall not be subject to any claims, demands or actions which may arise out of or in connection with the failure to respond to any alarm. 
(Ord. of 4-21-98, Art. II, § 2)

(c)  Upon activation of an alarm system and a request for assistance by the fire department no fire alarm user or other person listed with the fire department, shall fail or refuse to respond to the premises where the alarm occurred after being requested to do so by the City of Monroeville Central Dispatch. Any failure to respond to the premises within fifteen (15) minutes after requested to do so shall be deemed a failure to respond.

(Ord. of 4-21-98, Art. II, § 4)

(d)  The issuance of a courtesy letter of warning to the alarm user is not intended to create any rights of the alarm user. The issuance of a letter of warning is merely a courtesy offered by the fire department to induce the alarm user to make corrective actions to prevent future false fire alarms. 
(e)  The fire official shall have the right to inspect any alarm system upon request, to determine whether the alarm system is in proper working order and in compliance with this article.

(Ord. of 12-16-08(1), § 3) 
Sec. 5-23. - License shall be location specific. 
(a)  For each place at which any business is carried on, a separate license shall be paid, and any person desiring to engage in any business for which a license is required shall designate the place at which business is carried on, and the license to be issued shall designate such place, and such license shall authorize the carrying on of such business only at the place designated.

To establish a bona fide branch office, the taxpayer must demonstrate proof of all following criteria: 
(i)  The taxpayer must demonstrate the continuing existence of an actual facility located outside the police jurisdiction in which its principal business office is located, such as a retail store, outlet, business office, showroom, or warehouse, to which employees and/or independent contractors are assigned or located during regular normal working hours.

Provided that a mere change in the name or ownership of a taxpayer that is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other form of legal entity now or hereafter recognized by the laws of Alabama shall not constitute a transfer for the purposes of this chapter, unless (1) the change requires the taxpayer to obtain a new federal employer identification number or department of revenue taxpayer identification number or (2), in the discretion of the municipality, the subject license is one for the sale of alcoholic beverages. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a municipality from requiring a new business license application and approval for an alcoholic beverage license.

A violation of this provision, in addition to the penalties otherwise set forth in this article, shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offence, and if a willful violation, by imprisonment, not to exceed six (6) months, or both, at the discretion of the court trying the same.

Such license may not be issued without a finding by the city council of good cause for the failure to obtain or renew the license. The foregoing shall be additional to any other penalties imposed by this article, the city code or any statute for failure to obtain a license. 
    Provided it shall not be unlawful where such business, person, taxpayer, or agent of a person or taxpayer has been issued and holds a current license that has not been revoked or suspended and has been renewed and paid in full prior to January 31 of that license year. 
(2)  The provisions of this article shall be enforced by the license inspector, by whatever name called, under the supervision of the city clerk. This official shall have the authority: to enter upon the premises for the purpose of making inspections necessary in carrying out his/her duties; to write citations for violations; to institute criminal proceedings; and to require any illegal business or one operating illegally to immediately cease operations in accordance with the city's administrative and or/and enforcement procedures.

(b)  If the municipality determines that the amount of business license tax reported on or remitted with any business license remittance form is incorrect, if no business license remittance form is filed within the time prescribed, or if the information provided on the form is insufficient to allow the taxing jurisdiction to determine the proper amount of business license tax due, the municipality shall calculate the correct amount of the tax based on the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable and enter a preliminary assessment for the correct amount of business license tax, including any applicable penalty and interest. 
(c)  The municipality shall promptly mail a copy of any preliminary assessment to the taxpayer's last known address by either first class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested, or, in the sole discretion of the municipality, deliver the preliminary assessment to the taxpayer by personal delivery. 
(d)  If the amount of business license tax remitted by the taxpayer is undisputed by the municipality, or if the taxpayer consents to the amount of any deficiency or preliminary assessment in writing, the municipality shall enter a final assessment for the amount of the tax due, plus any applicable penalty and interest. 
(e)  If a taxpayer disagrees with a preliminary assessment as entered by the taxing jurisdiction, the taxpayer shall file a petition for review with the municipal license officer within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the preliminary assessment setting out the specific objections to the preliminary assessment. If a petition for review is timely filed, the license officer of the municipality shall schedule a conference with the taxpayer for the purpose of allowing the taxpayer or its representatives and the representatives of the municipality to present their respective positions, discuss any omissions or errors, and to attempt to agree upon any changes or modifications to their respective positions. 
(f)  If a petition for review is not timely filed or is timely filed and upon further review the license officer determines that the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the municipality may make the assessment final in the amount of business license tax due as computed by the licensing officer, with applicable interest and penalty computed to the date of entry of the final assessment. The license officer shall, whenever practicable, complete his or her review of the taxpayer's petition for review and applicable law within ninety (90) days following the later of the date of filing of the petition or the conference, if any. 
(g)  A copy of the final assessment shall promptly be mailed to the taxpayer's last known address by either first class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of business license tax of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or less; or by certified U.S. mail with return receipt request in the case of assessments of business license tax of more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). In either case, at the option of the taxing jurisdiction a copy of the final assessment may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal delivery. The final assessment shall include a statement informing the taxpayer of his or her right to appeal the final assessment to circuit court within thirty (30) days from the date of the entry of the final assessment. 
(Ord. of 12-16-08(1), § 8)

(b)  The taxpayer shall be notified by registered or certified mail, or by personal service, of the amount of any such assessment, and of his right to appear before the municipal governing body on a day named not less than twenty (20) days from the date of notice and to show cause why such assessment shall not be made final. Such appearance may be made by agent or attorney. 
(c)  If no showing in made on or before the date fixed in such notice, or if such showing is not sufficient in the judgment of the municipality, such assessment shall be made final in the amount originally fixed, or in such other amount as is determined by the municipality to be correct.

Sec. 5-29.10. - Refunds on overpayments. 
(a)  Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the municipality for any overpayment of business license tax erroneously paid to the municipality.

(Ord. of 12-16-08(1), § 20) 
Sec. 5-29.11. - Delivery license. 
(a)  In lieu of any other type of license, a taxpayer may at its option purchase for one hundred dollars ($100.00) plus the issuance fee, a delivery license for the privilege of delivering its merchandise in the municipality if the taxpayer meets all the following criteria: 
(1)  Other than deliveries, the taxpayer has no other physical presence within the municipality or its police jurisdiction. 
(2)  The taxpayer conducts no other business in the municipality other than delivering merchandise and performing the requisite set-up and installation of said merchandise; 
(3)  Such delivery and set-up and installation are performed by the taxpayer's employees or agents, concerns the taxpayer's own merchandise in that municipality, and is done by means of delivery vehicles owned, leased or contracted by the taxpayer; 
(4)  The gross receipts derived from the sale and any requisite set-up or installation of all merchandise so delivered shall not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) during the license year; 
(5)  Any set-up or installation shall relate only to (i) that required by the contract between the taxpayer and the customer or as may be required by state or local law, and (ii) the merchandise so delivered; 
(6)  If at any time during the current license year the taxpayer fails to meet any of the above stated criteria, then within forty-five (45) days after any of said criteria have been violated or exceeded, the taxpayer shall purchase a business delivery license or other appropriate license from the municipality, and will be subject to a penalty of ten dollars ($10.00). 
(b)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the municipality to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the seventy-five thousand dollar ($75,000.00) limitation described in the preceding section if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into the taxing jurisdiction using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. 
(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year. 
(e)  The purchase of a delivery license for the exemption from the purchase of a delivery license pursuant to subsection (f) shall not, in and of itself, establish nexus between the taxpayer and the municipality for purposes of the taxes levied by or under the authority of Title 40 of the Code of Alabama or other provisions of law, nor does the purchase of a delivery license conclusively determine that nexus does not exist between the taxpayer and the municipality. 
(f)  A taxpayer that otherwise meets the criteria for the purchase of a delivery license is not required to purchase a delivery license or a regular business license if (i) the taxpayer's gross receipts that are derived from within the municipality do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00); and (ii) the taxpayer has no other physical presence within the municipality during the year.

ARTICLE IX. - PEDDLERS AND SOLICITORS 

Sec. 5-139. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  This article is based on the following findings: 
(1)  The city council finds that persons and organizations have been visiting private residential properties, as well as privately owned businesses, for the purpose of soliciting sales of goods, wares, merchandise or services. 
(2)  Some residents and business owners find these commercial activities to be intrusive upon their privacy. 
(3)  The city council further finds that a variety of misrepresentations and other frauds are at times employed in such commercial activities. 
(4)  Unregulated door-to-door commercial solicitation constitutes a serious concern for the city. 
(5)  The goal of protecting residents and private business owners from fraud and crime and thereby promoting the safety and privacy of residents within the city and its police jurisdiction is a legitimate, urgent and substantial governmental interest. 
(6)  The city has a substantial interest in preventing fraudulent or criminal activities which may result from unregulated commercial solicitation. 
(7)  The city has a substantial interest in protecting individuals' safety and privacy by reasonably limiting the hours of commercial solicitation and setting those hours consistent with those recognized to be customary at retail commercial establishments within the city and its police jurisdiction and requiring the registration and permitting of commercial solicitors in a content neutral manner. 
(8)  The city has a substantial interest in allowing individuals to determine their level of comfort with privacy and whether or not they want to receive solicitation. 
(9)  Non-commercial speech is entitled to broader protection under the first amendment to the United States Constitution than commercial speech, affording the city greater ability to regulate commercial speech than non-commercial speech. 
(10)  All of these goals and interests may properly be served by this narrowly tailored regulation which requires commercial solicitors to obtain a permit prior to soliciting within the city or its police jurisdiction, reasonably limits the hours of activities, and prohibits solicitation of occupants of properties where signs have been posted prohibiting such activities. 
(11)  By adopting a registration system for commercial solicitations that identifies solicitors and requires basic background information from them, the city can limit the exposure of its citizens to fraud and misrepresentation and prevent persons with a history of violent crime from conducting solicitations. 
(12)  Some minor commercial transactions incidental to otherwise noncommercial activities are of a completely different character than the types of commercial solicitations targeted by this article. Thus, the council has consciously provided an exemption for sales by youth in support of educational, charitable and community activities, with the intent of protecting such traditional activities as cookie and candy sales. 
(b)  The purpose of this article is to balance free speech and expression with the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city and its police jurisdiction.

A copy of the order shall be delivered by the circuit clerk to the clerk of the municipal court. The circuit court may, on motion of defendant made within thirty (30) days of the order of dismissal, set aside the dismissal and other orders and reinstate the appeal on such terms as the court may prescribe for good cause shown by the defendant. 
(g)  Upon receipt of notice of dismissal of an appeal, the municipal court may issue a warrant for arrest of the defendant, who may also be arrested without a warrant as an escape. Upon arrest, the defendant shall be delivered to the municipal authorities and punished in accordance with the judgment of the municipal court. 
(h)  If a judgment is entered against a defendant upon appeal, the circuit court shall remand the defendant to the municipal authorities for punishment in accordance with the judgment of the circuit court, unless, when the judgment is for fine and costs only, the judgment is paid or a judgment is conferred therefor in favor of the municipality with sureties or as otherwise provided for convictions under state law. 
(i)  Upon receipt of payment of fines and costs upon appeals, the clerk of the circuit court shall, within thirty (30) days, pay ninety (90) percent of such fines and forfeitures, and ten (10) percent of the costs, to the treasurer of the municipality.

If the appeal is taken by the municipality, it shall not be required to give surety for the cost of the appeal. When taken by the defendant, he may give bail with sufficient sureties, conditioned that he will appear and abide by the judgment of the appellate court, and failing, to give bail he must be committed to the municipal jail; but he may give such bail at any time pending the appeal. When an appeal is taken by the defendant and bail is given pending the appeal, and the judgment of conviction is affirmed or the appeal is dismissed, the defendant is bound by the undertaking of bail to surrender himself to the municipal authorities within fifteen (15) days from the date of such affirmance or dismissal, and if he shall fail to do so, the clerk of the circuit court from which the appeal is taken, upon motion of the municipality, must endorse the bail bond forfeited, and a writ, or writs of arrest, must be issued by the clerk to the sheriff. Upon arrest, the defendant shall be delivered to the municipal authorities and the sentence must be carried out without delay, as if no appeal has been taken. If bail is forfeited as herein provided, a conditional judgment must be rendered by the court in favor of the municipality, and the same proceedings must be had thereon for the municipality as is authorized by law to be had in the name of the state in state cases.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 9.5-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title 11, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24, Chapter 45, Sections 1-11, Chapter 52, Sections 1-84, and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Monroeville, Alabama, does ordain as is set out in this chapter. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-2. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of Monroeville, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-5. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Monroeville, Alabama. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-6. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated February 4, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for Monroe County are hereby adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS such as the flood prone areas, identified on the map prepared by Goodwyn, Mills and Cawood, Inc. and adopted by the city planning commission on December 4, 1995. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-7. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-8. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-9. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-10. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Monroeville or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-12. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor.

    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 44, § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-19. - Floodways. 
(1)  Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 9.5-6, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
(b)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
(c)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(d)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
(e)  Only if section 9.5-19(1)(b), (c) or (d), above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article III. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-20. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 9.5-6, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (approximate A-zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 9.5-6, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Article III. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (4) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of section 9.5-17(a) and section 9.5-18(1) through (4). 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of section 9.5-18(3)b.2. in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 9.5-17(4), Elevated Buildings. 
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-21. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 9.5-6, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 9.5-17(4), Elevated Buildings. 
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level or two (2) feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 9.5-15(1)(c) and section 9.5-15(2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
ARTICLE IV. - VARIANCES 

Sec. 9.5-22. - Procedures. 
(a)  The zoning board of adjustment as established by the Code of Ordinances, City of Monroeville, Appendix A, Article X shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of adjustment may appeal such decision to the circuit court, as provided in the Code of Alabama (1975). 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(Ord. of 2-3-09(2)) 
Sec. 9.5-23. - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(1)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(e)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the zoning board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(Ord. of 2-3-09(3); Ord. of 11-19-13(2); Ord. No. 2019-01-002, 1-8-19) 
Sec. 10-40. - Trash and yard waste preparation and collection policy. 
    The city will collect yard waste throughout the week. The total amount of yard waste collected per week from each property is limited to two (2) cubic yards, which is equivalent to a pile measuring three (3) feet high by three (3) feet wide by six (6) feet long. Only the yard waste described below will be collected by the city. Medium and heavy yard waste such as tree stumps, logs, root balls, limbs or branches exceeding three (3) inches in diameter and eight (8) feet in length and other tree cuttings or land clearing debris must be disposed of, within two (2) weeks of the time of cutting, by the property owner or the contractor supplying the lawn or tree service to the property owner. 
(a)  Light yard waste. Light yard waste consisting of leaves and grass clippings will be picked up by a vacuuming machine under the following conditions: 
(1)  Leaves and grass clippings must be placed in a furrow near the curb, not a pile. 
(2)  No rocks or other hard objects such as, wood, plastic or metal shall be mixed in with the leaves or grass clippings as these objects may damage the vacuuming machine and result in costly repairs to equipment. 
(3)  Vehicles must not be parked along the curb or in the city right-of-way in areas where leaves and grass clippings are to be picked up. If vehicles are parked in the way, no pick up will occur. 
(4)  Leaves and grass clippings shall not be placed over storm sewer inlets or in drainage ditches so that they prevent proper drainage of storm water. If necessary, wet leaves and grass clippings after placement to prevent them from blowing into the street or drainage ditch. 
Other light yard waste must be piled separately for pick up by a boom truck. 
(b)  Light yard waste. Light yard waste consisting of tree limbs and branches will be picked up with a boom truck under the following conditions: 
(1)  Tree limbs and branches must be cut into lengths no longer than eight (8) feet and their diameter should be no larger than three (3) inches. They must be stacked parallel to the road and separated from leaf and grass furrows. 
(2)  Tree limbs exceeding three (3) inches in diameter and eight (8) feet in length will not be picked up by the city. They must be disposed of by the property owner or the contractor supplying the service. 
(c)  Recycling of light yard waste. The city encourages the recycling of light yard waste into mulch and/or compost. Burying light yard waste in a landfill is not a responsible or cost-effective way to use valuable landfill space. Buried under trash in a landfill, yard waste takes years to decompose and its value is lost forever. Leaving grass clippings on the lawn after mowing to dry and decompose supplies valuable nutrients that improve soil quality. Grass clippings are twenty (20) to thirty (30) percent protein and usually have about four (4) percent nitrogen, two (2) percent potassium and one-half (0.5) percent phosphorus as well as all the necessary trace elements plants need. 
Using oak tree leaves and pine needles as mulch helps the soil to keep moisture, reduce weeds and prevent erosion. 
Compost can be made in your own back yard and may be used for mulch, potting soil or top dressing. Organics including non-greasy food waste, leaves, grass clippings, paper and wood are ideal for composting. 
(d)  Other trash. Other large or heavy solid waste items such as those listed below, shall be picked up by the city for the fees shown in the listing. Pick up must be scheduled and payment made in advance. Arrangements for pick up must be made at the City Hall. Large and heavy item pickups will made on either Thursday or Friday. Once pick up has been scheduled, the items to be picked up must be placed at the curb side by 7:00 a.m. on the morning of the scheduled pick up date. 
Landscape contractors, lawn services and tree service contractors doing work on occupied properties may place leaves, grass clippings, light yard waste near the street on the property from which they were cut for pickup by the city. No yard waste of any type shall be picked up by the city from vacant lots, or from lots with a vacant or abandoned building unless the owner of the lot is paying for garbage collection service on the lot. 
Contractors engaged in the care and maintenance of lawns for commercial or residential properties must keep trash, grass and leaf debris from being left in the streets. Any debris that has been discarded into the streets must be cleaned up. If it is necessary for the city to sweep and/or clean the streets because of contractors discarding the debris into the streets, the city will charge the contractors for the work. 
It shall be unlawful for any pulpwood, commercial tree trimming or tree surgery company or persons engaged in the business of pulp-wooding, tree trimming or tree surgery to place limbs, clippings, cuttings, vegetation or debris resulting from pulp-wooding or tree trimming on any public street right-of-way, as a result of activity on private property, for pickup by city trash vehicles. It shall further be unlawful for any property owner to place limbs, clippings, cuttings, vegetation or debris resulting from activities of one engaged in the business of pulp-wooding, tree trimming or tree surgery on any public street right-of-way for pickup by city trash vehicles.

Sec. 11-30. - Overgrown grass and weeds prohibited and declared a nuisance. 
    It shall be unlawful and declared a nuisance and injurious to public health, safety and general welfare for any occupant, owner, lessee, or person in control of any property within the city to allow the growth of weeds, grass and vegetation to attain a height greater than twelve (12) inches above the ground. Overgrown grass, weeds and vegetation provides breeding grounds and shelter for rats, mice, snakes, mosquitoes, and other vermin, insects, and pests; when dry, poses a potential fire threat or hazard; bears wingy or downy seeds, when mature, that cause the spread of weeds and, when breathed, irritates the throat, lungs, and eyes of the public; hides debris, such as broken glass or metal, that could inflict injury on a person going upon the property; and is unsightly. 
(1)  Duties of owner. It shall be the duty of the owner of any real property located within the city to maintain any grass or weeds growing upon said property in such a manner as not to constitute a nuisance. The duties and obligations of the owner extend to and include any real property situated within a dedicated right-of-way or easement burdening the property, except to the extent that it may be impracticable to do so because of public facilities located thereon. Such rights-of-way and easement must be maintained by the owner in a manner consistent with the maintenance of the owner's remaining property and within the requirements in this article, except to the extent it may be impracticable to do because of public facilities located thereon. 
(2)  Maintenance practices of city. The dedication and existence of a right-of-way for a public road or of an easement for drainage or for public utilities represents the grant of only a limited interest in property and does not change the actual ownership of the property upon which the right-of-way or easement is located. The public authority maintains rights-of-way and easements only to the extent necessary to maintain the public facility and to maintain safety. The owner of the burdened property continues to control the property, except to the extent that such control interferes with the public use. The public authority does not cut grass, weeds and other growth upon rights-of-way or easements, except to the extent necessary for operations and safety purposes. All other maintenance is the responsibility of the owner of the property upon which the right-of-way or easement is located.

Before the report is submitted to the city council, a copy of the report shall be posted for at least five (5) days prior thereto on or near the chamber door of the city council, together with a notice of the time when the report shall be submitted to the city council for confirmation. 
(7)  Confirmation of report; weed liens. At the time fixed for receiving and considering the report, the city council shall hear the report, together with any objections which may be raised by any of the property owners liable to be assessed for the work of abating the nuisance and thereupon make modifications in the report as deemed necessary, after which by motion or resolution the report shall be confirmed. The amounts for the cost for abating the nuisance in front of or upon the various parcels of land mentioned in the report shall hereinafter be referred to as "weed liens," and shall constitute a weed lien on the property for the amount the weed liens respectively. After confirmation of the reports, a copy shall be given to the tax collector or revenue commissioner of the county who, under the "optional method of taxation," is charged with the collection of the municipal taxes pursuant to Article 1, Division 2, Chapter 51, of Title 11 of the Code of Alabama.

Sec. 11-32. - Emergency action. 
    In cases of necessity for prompt action in abating nuisances, when the matter or thing which is considered a nuisance, is in law clearly a public nuisance, the compliance officer or building official may in writing order the chief of police to remove or abate the same at once, without waiting for a judicial ascertainment of the fact that a nuisance actually exists. 
(Ord. of 2-21-06) 
Sec. 11-33. - General provisions. 
(1)  Requirement for registration of nuisance abatement agents. Businesses or individuals who register with the city clerk and are approved by the city council to abate nuisances pursuant to this chapter and who have filed with the city clerk a certificate of insurance and proof of compliance with all city licensing requirements shall be included on the list of registered nuisance abatement agents. The certificate of insurance shall reflect coverage of adequate comprehensive general liability insurance as required by state law and shall be made by a company authorized to do business in the State of Alabama. Said list of registered nuisance abatement agents shall be posted in the office of the compliance officer or building official of the city. However, such names shall not constitute a recommendation and failure to post such list shall in no way affect the operation of this chapter. 
(2)  Civil recovery of abatement costs. In lieu of assessing such removal or abatement costs against the respective property, the city may elect to recover the cost of abating or removing the nuisance from the owner of the property through a legal action filed in the court of appropriate jurisdiction.

(4)  Abatement procedures separate from penalty. The requirement to abate a nuisance is not a penalty for violating this chapter but is an additional remedy. Abatement proceedings and prosecution of a violation may occur simultaneously.

Sec. 17-81. - General discharge prohibitions. 
    No user, person, firm, or corporation shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation of performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
(1)  Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two (2) successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system), be more than five (5) percent not any single reading over ten (10) percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include but are not limited to: alcohols aldehydes, benzene, bromates carbides, chlorates, commercial solyents, ethers, fuel oil, gasoline, or any hydrocarbon derivatives, hydrides, kerosene, ketones mineral spirits, motor oils, naphtha, perchlorates, peroxides, sultides, toluene, xylene and any other substances which the city, the state, or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. 
(2)  Any pollutants which will cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW (in no case with a pH less than 6.0 or higher than 10.0) or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW, unless the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater (see division 11-Exceptions). 
(3)  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the POTW such as, but not limited to: garbage not properly shredded or garbage with particles greater than one-half (1/2) inch in any dimension, ashes, cinders, animal entrails, paunch, manure, offal, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, whole blood, beer or distillery slops, feathers, sand, lime residues, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, grass clippings, rags, spent grants, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, fiberglass, paint or ink residues, gas, tar, asphalt residues, chemical residues, residues from refining or processing of wastes; any water or waste which contains more than one hundred (100) ppm (by weight) of animal or mineral fats, oil, grease; or any water or waste which contains a substance that will solidify or become viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) degrees Fahrenheit and ninety (90) degrees Fahrenheit. The installation and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths (3/4) horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the city superintendent. 
(4)  Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a discharge have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than fifteen (15) minutes, more than five (5) times the average twenty-four-hour concentration, quantities, or flow during normal operation of the discharger facility. 
(5)  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW plant which exceeds forty (40) degrees Celsius (one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit). Unless a higher temperature is allowed in the user SID permit, no user shall discharge into any sewer line or appurtenance of the POTW wastewater system with a temperature exceeding sixty-five point six (65.6) degrees Celsius (one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit) (see exceptions, division 11). 
(6)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 307(a) of the Act. No TTO, PP, or VOC compounds shall be discharged into the sewer system without written notification to the superintendent. A complete list of all such compounds and the amounts of each discharged to the POTW shall be delivered to the sewer superintendent once each calendar quarter. 
(7)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance, while being conveyed through the sanitary sewer and at the POTW operating in its normal mode, as defined by state law, or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for their maintenance and repair. 
(8)  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, scums, or unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process where the POTW's pursuing a reuse and reclamation program or to cause undue additional labor and materials in connection with its operation. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used, or any future federal regulation. 
(9)  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards. 
(10)  Any wastewater with color sufficient to increase the color in the receiving stream by more than fifty (50) ADMI at the design flow rate of the POTW when the receiving stream is at the calculated 7Q 10 rate of flow. 
(11)  Any liquid or wastewater containing quantities of radioactive waste in excess of presently existing or subsequently accepted limits for drinking water as established by applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the industrial concern, as long as the POTW operation complies within the NPDES limits authorized by EPA and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. 
(Ord. of 4-20-99(2), Art. 2(3)) 
Sec. 17-82. - Industrial waste pretreatment. 
(a)  All persons desiring to discharge industrial wastewater to the city's POTW must first complete an industrial waste questionnaire as attached hereto and submit the questionnaire to the sewer superintendent for review. If, after review by the superintendent and ADEM as noted in the agreement, the industry is found to be subject to the federal or state pretreatment program, then that person must obtain a state indirect discharge (SID) permit. 
(b)  All persons discharging industrial wastewater directly or indirectly to the city's POTW prior to the effective date of the article from which this section is derived and who have obtained prior approval of the industrial wastewater discharge, must complete the industrial waste questionnaire as required under Section II of the agreement. If, after review by the superintendent and ADEM as noted in the agreement, the industry is found to be subject to the federal and state pretreatment program, then that industry must obtain a state indirect discharge (SID) permit within the required time frame established by EPA and ADEM. 
(c)  These regulations adopt and use as a guide the National Pretreatment Standards and the Environmental Protection Agency's pretreatment guidelines. The city recognizes that in some cases these pretreatment standards may not be sufficient to protect the operation of its treatment works, or make it unable to comply with terms of its NPDES permit. In such cases, the superintendent reserves the right to impose more stringent pretreatment standards than those specified in the EPA regulations. 
(Ord. of 4-20-99(2), Art. 2(4)) 
Sec. 17-83. - Prohibitions on storm drainage and groundwater.

ARTICLE X. - VARIANCES 

Sec. 13.1. - Hardship. 
    Whereas the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships may result from strict compliance with these regulations, due to unusual topographic or other conditions beyond the control of the subdivider, it may vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying the interest or purpose of the subdivision regulations, zoning ordinance, sketch thorough-fare plan, or other elements of the Monroeville master plan. 
    Such variance, thus authorized, shall be entered in writing in the minutes of the planning commission along with the reason which justified the departure set forth. 
Sec. 13.2. - Experimental subdivisions. 
    The planning commission may waive, vary, or modify the standards and requirements of these regulations if, in its judgment, an unusual or experimental subdivision might prove of considerable merit toward: 
(a)  The use of unusual materials in constructing required improvements. 
(b)  A new or untried design concept in the Monroeville area which appears promising. 
    Special attention may be given to experimental subdivisions which are related to low cost housing design in an effort to provide housing for low income families. The planning commission shall require the subdivider to provide a written proposal stating the nature of the experiment, and cost-benefit study following the implementation of same. 
Sec. 13.3. - Comprehensive group housing development. 
(a)  A comprehensive group housing development to be constructed on a plot of ground of at least four (4) acres, including construction of two (2) or more buildings together with the necessary drives and ways of access and which is not subdivided into the customary lots, blocks and streets, may be approved by the planning commission if, in the opinion of the commission, no departure from the foregoing regulations can be made without destroying the intent of the regulations. 
(b)  Plans for all such developments shall be submitted to be approved by the planning commission whether or not such plat is to be recorded. No building permits shall be issued until such approval has been given. 
Sec. 13.4. - Conditions. 
    In granting variances, modifications, and approval for experimental subdivisions, the planning commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied, modified, or approved. These may include, without being limited to: personal, surety, performance, or maintenance bonds: affidavits, covenants or other legal instruments. 
ARTICLE XI. - REMEDIES 

Sec. 14.1. - Penalties for transferring lot in unapproved subdivisions. 
    Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision, transfers or sells any land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of a subdivision, before such plat has been approved by the planning commission and recorded or filed in the office of the appropriate county probate office, shall forfeit and pay a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each lot or parcel so transferred or sold; and the description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided. The municipal corporation may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by action for injunction brought in any court of equity jurisdiction or may recover the same penalty by a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
ARTICLE XII. - SEVERABILITY AND SEPARABILITY 

Sec. 15.1. - Validity of ordinance unimpaired. 
    Should any article, section, subsection, or provision of these subdivision regulations be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of the subdivision regulations as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be invalid or unconstitutional. 
ARTICLE XIII. - EFFECTIVE DATE 

Sec. 16.1. - From enactment. 
    These subdivision regulations shall take effect and be in force from and after the date of adoption. Subdivision regulations heretofore adopted are hereby amended. 
APPENDIX I. - PROCEDURE 
(A)  Layout approval. 
(1)  General. The purpose of the layout approval is to give the subdivider and his engineer or land surveyor an opportunity to confer with the subdivision committee and the planning commission, as to the proposed subdivision, in order to help prevent the waste of time, money and effort. 
Planning commission approval of a subdivision layout is based on sketchy information and is not studied in depth, consequently such approval action is not binding toward preliminary plan approval. 
The subdivider should also consult with parties interested or affected by the development, i.e.., lending and mortgage insurance institutions. Also it would be advisable to engage a land planning specialist to help resolve major factors into a workable and profitable plan. 
(2)  Steps in obtaining approval (see chart). 
(i)  Owner's engineer should submit one copy each of the layout to the city electric department, water and sewage department, gas department, city engineer and health department in order to obtain such advice and/or requirements as they may offer. Owner's engineer may desire to make further changes in light of recommendations made by said departments. 
(ii)  Owner's engineer shall submit two (2) copies of the layout, as specified in the subdivision regulations to the city planning commission along with written application for layout approval, at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The layout is reviewed for conformance to subdivision regulations, zoning ordinance and other land regulating policies. Notice may be given that there will be a public hearing before the planning commission if it is deemed necessary. The layout is placed on the agenda for the coming subdivision committee meeting for which it is eligible. 
(iii)  The subdivision committee, made up of the above-named departments, will review the layout as submitted by the owner's engineer, and submit a recommendation for action to the planning commission. A representative of the owner's engineer should attend those meetings of the subdivision committee at which his client's subdivision is to be discussed. 
(iv)  The planning commission may hold a public hearing regarding the subdivision if deemed advisable. The planning commission will consider only those layouts which have been reviewed by the subdivision committee. The planning commission may approve layout; approve layout with conditions; or disapprove layout. All commission action shall be recorded in the planning commission minutes. 
(v)  Owner or owner's engineer will be notified of the action taken by the planning commission. 

LAYOUT APPROVAL FLOW DIAGRAM
(B)  Preliminary approval. 
(1)  General. After conclusions have been reached at the layout stage and layout approval granted, the subdivider must formally make application for preliminary approval which is mandatory before the subdivision can be reviewed for final approval. Preliminary approval shall be tentative in nature and shall in no wise constitute a waiver of the requirements to be met for final plat approval, and shall lapse if final plat approval is not obtained within one year, unless such period of time is extended by the planning commission. Preliminary approval is also required prior to any grading or other improvements to the subdivision. 
The subdivider shall have a preliminary plan prepared containing all plans and data as specified in the subdivision regulations. 
(2)  Steps in obtaining approval (see chart). 
(i)  Owner's engineer shall submit two (2) copies each of that portion of all of the preliminary plan as may be required to the city electric department, water and sewage department, gas department, city engineer and the health department no later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered. These departments will, upon review, sign the appropriate certificates of both copies, retain one copy for their files and submit the second copy to the subdivision committee. 
(ii)  Owner's engineer shall submit one copy of the preliminary plan, as specified in the subdivision regulations, to the planning commission with written application (see sample application) for preliminary approval at least fourteen (14) days before the planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered. Upon receipt of the application for preliminary approval the planning commission will review the plan for conformance to the approved layout, subdivision regulations, zoning ordinance and other land regulating policies. The layout will then be placed on the agenda for the coming subdivision committee meeting for which it is eligible. Notice shall be given as to the time and place for a public hearing to be held before the planning commission. 
(iii)  The subdivision committee, made up of the above-named departments, will review the preliminary plan as submitted by the owner's engineer, and submit a recommendation for action to the planning commission. A representative of the owner's engineer should attend those meetings of the subdivision committee at which his client's subdivision is to be discussed. 
(iv)  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing regarding the subdivision. The planning commission will consider only those preliminary plans which have been reviewed by the subdivision committee. The planning commission may approve the preliminary plan; approve the preliminary plan with conditions; or disapprove the preliminary plan. All commission action shall be recorded in the planning commission minutes. 
(v)  Owner's engineer will be notified of the action taken by the planning commission. 

PRELIMINARY APPROVAL FLOW DIAGRAM
(C)  Final plat approval. 
(1)  General. 
After preliminary approval has been obtained, the next step is final plat approval. The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plan as approved and if so desired it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and then develop, provided however that such portion conforms to all the requirements of the subdivision regulations. 
Final approval of a subdivision by the planning commission is required prior to the recording of the plat in the office of the probate judge. It is not legal to "transfer or sell or agree to sell or negotiate to sell" any land in said subdivision until the plat is recorded. 
Final approval is also required prior to the construction of any structures, and no certificate of occupancy will be issued until such time as the subdivision has been given final approval. 
(2)  Steps in obtaining approval (see chart). 
(i)  Upon fulfillment of the requirements for final plat approval as stipulated in the subdivision regulations, the owner's engineer shall submit the original and eleven (11) copies of the final plat with formal application for final approval to the planning commission (see approval application), at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. 
(ii)  The planning commission upon receipt of the formal application will review the plat for conformance to the preliminary plan, the subdivision regulations, the zoning ordinance and other land regulating policies. 
(iii)  The planning commission will obtain the required signatures of all departments of the city necessary to qualify the plat document for presentation to the planning commission. These signatures may or may not be obtained at a meeting of the subdivision committee, depending upon the conditions under which the final plat is being filed. 
(iv)  Upon containing all the appropriate signatures required, the final plat shall be placed on the agenda for the next planning commission meeting for which it is eligible. If the final plat is found to meet all the requirements, the planning commission certificate is signed. 
(v)  The planning commission will return the original plat document to the owner's engineer. 
(vi)  The owner or his representative shall have the approved plat recorded in the appropriate county. 

FINAL PLAT APPROVAL FLOW DIAGRAM
(D)  Variance procedure. 
(1)  General. In the event the property owner desires to request a variance as authorized in these regulations, the following procedure shall apply: 
(2)  Certificate approval procedure. 
(a)  The property owner shall cause to have drawn up a legal document referred to hereafter as a "Certificate to Subdivide" (see sample certificate). It is advisable that the property owner have a land survey made of the property in question and that the surveyor's certificate be attached to and become a part of the certificate to subdivide. The property owner shall submit the original and two (2) copies of the certificate to subdivide to the planning department with a request for approval by the planning commission. 
(b)  The planning commission will review the request as to its conformity with the subdivision regulations, the zoning ordinance and other land regulating codes and policies. If the certificate is found to be in conformity with all requirements, the planning commission will place the certificate on the agenda for the next regular meeting of the planning commission. 
(c)  The planning commission will approve, approve on condition, or deny approval of said certificate to subdivide. If approved, the certificate shall be signed and acknowledged by the chairman, vice-chairman or secretary of the planning commission and notarized. 
(d)  The planning commission shall return the original of the certificate to subdivide to the property owner or his representative. 
(e)  The property owner or his representative shall have the approved original of the certificate to subdivide recorded in the office of the judge of probate of the county within which said land is located.

b.  Grantee agrees to obtain a permit as required by City prior to removing, abandoning, relocating or reconstructing, if necessary, any portion of its facilities, other than for the normal routine installation of Drop(s) and maintenance activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, City understands and acknowledges there may be instances when Grantee is required to make significant repairs that are of an emergency nature. Permits for emergency work, if necessary, shall be applied for as soon as possible, but in no event later than (5) business days after the emergency work has commenced. 
c.  The fees paid to obtain permits are separate, and in addition to, any other fees included in the Franchise. 
d.  City may issue reasonable policy guidelines to all grantees to establish procedures for determining how to control issuance of construction permits to multiple users of the same Rights-of-Way.

e.  Upon reasonable prior written notice, Grantee shall use reasonable efforts to meet with developers and be present at pre-construction meetings to ensure that Cable System facilities are installed in new developments within City in a timely manner, with such obligation being subject to all other requirements or limitations in this Agreement. 
2.  Use of Existing Poles or Conduits. 
a.  Grantee shall use its best efforts to utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities belonging to either Grantee or other utility providers whenever commercially reasonable and shall not construct or install any new, different or additional poles, conduits or other facilities on public property without the written approval of City. No location or any pole or wire-holding structure of Grantee shall be a vested interest, and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by Grantee at its own expense whenever City determines that such a move is a public necessity. The Grantee shall not be responsible for the cost associated with relocating the Cable System to accommodate other providers, including the City, or private development projects or to satisfy a zoning condition imposed upon a developer by the City. 
b.  The facilities of Grantee shall be installed underground in those areas of City where all other public or private utilities are underground at the time of construction by Grantee. In areas where the facilities of all other public or private utilities are installed aerially at the time of System construction, Grantee may install its facilities aerially; however, at such time as the existing aerial facilities of all other public or private utilities are placed underground, Grantee shall likewise place its facilities underground at its sole cost. If City requires utilities to bury lines which are currently overhead, and the City financially participates in said under grounding, then the City shall provide the same cost sharing to the Grantee. 
3.  Minimum Interference. 
a.  Grantee shall use its best efforts to give reasonable prior notice to any adjacent private property owners who will be negatively affected or impacted by Grantee's significant construction work in the Rights-of-Way. 
b.  All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by Grantee shall be located so as to cause minimum interference with the unencumbered use of Rights-of-Way and other public places and minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the Rights-of-Way and public places. 
4.  Disturbance or Damage. Any and all Rights-of-Way, or public or private property, which are disturbed or damaged during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance, expansion, extension or reconstruction of the System shall be promptly and fully restored by Grantee, at its expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing prior to Grantee's work. If Grantee fails to promptly perform the restoration required herein, after written request of City and reasonable opportunity to satisfy that request, City shall have the right to put the Rights-of-Way back into condition as good as that prevailing prior to Grantee's work. In the event City determines that Grantee is responsible for such disturbance or damage, Grantee shall be obligated to fully reimburse City for such reasonable cost of restoration within thirty (30) days after its receipt of City's invoice therefore. 
5.  Temporary Relocation. 
a.  At any time during the Term of the Franchise, Grantee shall, upon its receipt of reasonable advance written notice, to be not less than ten (10) business days, and at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove any of its property when, in the opinion of City, (i) the same is required by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, Rights-of-Way vacation, freeway or Rights-of-Way construction, alteration to or establishment of any Rights-of-Way or any facility within the Rights-of-Way, sidewalk, or other public place, including but not limited to, installation of sewers, drains, waterlines, power lines, traffic signal lines or transportation facilities; or (ii) a City project or activity makes disconnection, removal, or relocation necessary or less expensive for City. If the City requests the relocation, removal or reinstallation of any of Grantee's facilities in any of the Rights-of-Way for the sole purpose of installing or providing its own cable television or telecommunications services or those of a second cable television or telecommunications service provider in competition with Grantee, then such cost shall not be borne by Grantee but by the City or requesting entity. 
b.  Grantee shall, on prior written request of any Person holding a permit to move a building, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the movement of such buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the Person requesting the same, and Grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. Grantee shall be given not less than five (5) days advance notice to arrange such temporary wire alterations and thirty (30) days to complete the raising or lowering of such lines. 
6.  Emergency. Whenever, in case of fire or other emergency, it becomes necessary in the judgment of the Mayor, police chief, fire chief, or their delegates, to remove or damage any of Grantee's facilities, no charge shall be made by Grantee against City for restoration, repair or damages. 
7.  Tree Trimming. Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees on public Rights-of-Way at its own expense as may be necessary to protect its wires and facilities. Trimming of trees on private property shall require consent of the property owner. Any trimming of trees by the Grantee in the Rights-of-Way and public ways shall be subject to such regulation or supervision as the Mayor or other authorized official may establish to protect the public health, safety and convenience. 
8.  Protection of Facilities. Nothing contained in this section shall relieve any Person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging Grantee's facilities while performing any work connected with grading, regrading or changing the line of any Rights-of-Way or public place or the construction or reconstruction of any sewer or water system. 
9.  Installation Records. Grantee shall keep accurate Installation records of the location of all facilities in the Rights-of-Way and public ways and furnish strand maps to City upon prior written request. Grantee shall cooperate with City to furnish such information in an electronic mapping format which, if possible, shall be compatible with the then-current City electronic mapping format. Upon completion of new or relocation construction of underground facilities in the Rights-of-Way and public ways, Grantee shall provide City with Installation records in an electronic format which, if possible, shall be compatible with the then-current City electronic mapping format showing the location of the underground and above ground facilities. 
10.  Locating Facilities. 
a.  If, during the design process for public improvements, City discovers a potential conflict with proposed construction, Grantee shall either: (a) locate and, if necessary, expose its facilities in conflict or (b) use a location service to locate or expose its facilities. Grantee is obligated to furnish the location information in a timely manner, but in no case longer than thirty (30) days. 
b.  City reserves the prior and superior right to lay, construct, erect, install, use, operate, repair, replace, remove, relocate, regrade, widen, realign, or maintain any Rights-of-Way and public ways, aerial, surface, or subsurface improvement, including but not limited to water mains, traffic control conduits, cable and devices, sanitary or storm sewers, subways, tunnels, bridges, viaducts, or any other public construction within the Rights-of-Way of City limits. 
11.  City's Rights. 
a.  Nothing in this Franchise shall be construed to prevent City from constructing, maintaining, repairing or relocating sewers; grading, paving, maintaining, repairing, relocating and/or altering any Right-of-Way; constructing, laying down, repairing, maintaining or relocating any water mains; or constructing, maintaining, relocating, or repairing any sidewalk or other public work. 
12.  Facilities in Conflict. If, during the course of a project, City determines Grantee's facilities are in conflict, the following shall apply: 
a.  Prior to City Notice to Proceed to Contractor: Grantee shall, within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding three (3) months, remove or relocate the conflicting facility. This time period shall begin running upon receipt by Grantee of written notice from City. However, if both City and Grantee agree, the time frame may be extended based on the requirements of the project. 
b.  Subsequent to City Notice to Proceed to Contractor: City and Grantee will immediately begin the coordination necessary to remove or relocate the facility. Removal or relocation is to begin no later than seventy-two (72) hours, if practicable, after written notification from City of the conflict. 
13.  Relocation Delays. Subject to Grantee's compliance with 3.12 above, if Grantee's relocation effort so delays construction of a public project causing City to be liable for delay damages, Grantee shall reimburse City for those direct damages attributable to the delay created by Grantee. In the event Grantee should dispute the amount of damages attributable to Grantee, the matter shall be referred to the City engineer for a decision. In the event that Grantee disagrees with the City Engineer's, the matter shall be submitted to the Mayor or the Mayor's designee for determination, whose decision shall be final and binding upon Grantee as a matter of City review, but nothing herein waives any right of appeal to the courts. 
14.  Interference with City Facilities. The Installation, use and maintenance of the Grantee's facilities within the Rights-of-Way and public ways authorized herein shall be in such a manner as not to interfere with City's placement, construction, use and maintenance of its Rights-of-Way and public ways, Rights-of-Way lighting, water pipes, drains, sewers, traffic signal systems or other City systems that have been, or may be, installed, maintained, used or authorized by City. 
15.  Interference with Utility Facilities. Grantee agrees not to install, maintain or use any of its facilities in such a manner as to damage or interfere with any existing facilities of another utility located within the Rights-of-Way and public ways of City and agrees to relocate its facilities, if necessary, to accommodate another facility relocation. Nothing in this section is meant to limit any rights Grantee may have under Applicable Laws to be compensated for the cost of relocating its facilities from the utility that is requesting the relocation. 
16.  Collocation. To maximize public and employee safety, to minimize visual clutter of aerial plant, and to minimize the amount of trenching and excavation in and along City Rights-of-Way and sidewalks for underground plant, Grantee shall make every commercially reasonable effort to co-locate compatible facilities within the Rights-of-Way subject to the engineering requirements of the owners of utility poles and other facilities. 
17.  Access to Open Trenches. The City agrees to include the Grantee in the platting process for any new subdivision.

The overlay district maps shall be identified by name and signature of the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk. All dimensions and explanations included on the overlay district maps are adopted and made a part of this Zoning Ordinance.
Section 4 - Location and Interpretation of District Boundaries
The exact location of zoning district boundaries on the Zoning Map(s) shall be determined using the following rules.
4.1 Corporate Limits: When district boundaries are indicated as following the corporate limits, the corporate limit lines shall be construed to be the district boundaries.
4.2 Lot Lines: When district boundaries are indicated as following lot lines, the lot lines shall be construed to be the district boundaries.
4.3 Centerlines: When district boundaries are indicated as following the center line of streets and alleys, railroads, waterways, or such lines extended, the centerlines or the extensions of these lines shall be construed to be the district boundaries.
4.4 Parallel Lines: When district boundaries are indicated approximately parallel to corporate limits, lot lines, the center lines of streets and alleys, railroads or waterways, the zoning district lines shall be construed as being parallel to and at the distance indicated on the Zoning Map. If no dimension is given on the zoning map, the distance shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the Zoning Map.
4.5 Divisions of Land: When district boundaries divide land that is in single ownership and less than four acres in area, the district lines, unless specified by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the Zoning Map. The district regulation applying to the majority of the lot or land area (51% or more) shall only be extended to the entire lot or land by a ruling made by the Board of Zoning Adjustment. Any other interpretations or extensions of district boundaries involving two acres or more shall require rezoning.
4.6 Vacated Rights-of-Way: When a public right-of-way for a street, alley or other public land, or a private right-of-way such as a railroad, is officially vacated or abandoned through proper legal procedure as established by the Code of Alabama, 1975 as amended, the district regulations applicable to the property to which the vacated or abandoned land reverted shall apply to the vacated or abandoned land. If necessary, the zoning district boundary shall be adjusted to comply with the decision to vacate public property.
22
4.7 Interpretation by Zoning Board of Adjustment: In the case of any uncertainty, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall determine the exact location of district boundaries. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may also order detailed maps prepared for any part of the City to interpret, following the guidelines contained in preceding paragraphs, the exact location of the zoning district boundaries.
