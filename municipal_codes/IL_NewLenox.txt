PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of New Lenox, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Village Code, as supplemented through Ordinance No. 1613, adopted February 8, 2005, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice-President of Production and Elizabeth Butler, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Marcia Englert, Village Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

Sec. 1-3. - Catchlines of sections and other headings. 
    The catchlines of the several subsections and sections and the headings of chapters, articles and divisions of this Code are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the subsection, section, chapter, article or division and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such subsections, sections, chapters, articles and divisions or as any part of the subsection, section, chapter, article or division, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such subsections, sections, chapters, articles or divisions, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted. 
(Code 1981, § 1-3-3)

    Any ordinance amending this Code shall set forth the chapter and section number of the section or sections to be amended, and this shall constitute a sufficient compliance with any statutory requirement pertaining to the amendment or revision by ordinance of any part of this Code. All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code that amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion in this Code, or, if chapters, sections and subsections or any parts thereof are repealed by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby, and the subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code of Ordinances by the board of trustees. 
(Code 1981, § 1-1-3) 
Sec. 1-6. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by village personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the president and board of trustees. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive parts of permanent and general ordinances passed by the president and board of trustees during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _______ to _______" (inserting sections numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections or the alphabetical arrangement of new chapters inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-7. - Unauthorized alteration of Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person in the village to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever that will cause the law of the village to be misrepresented thereby. 
(Code 1981, § 1-1-4)

a.  Maintains a bona fide establishment for transacting businesses in the village corporate boundaries (hereinafter "village"); or 
b.  A contractor whose regular full-time workforce includes a majority of village residents. 
(2)  To be considered by the village as a "local bidder," the contractor or vendor must certify to the village that either: 
a.  Maintains a bona fide establishment for transacting businesses in the village corporate boundaries; or 
b.  That a majority of the contractor's regular, full-time workforce, is comprised of village residents, along with payroll records sufficient to verify this certification.

Under no circumstance will any contract be awarded to a responsible local bidder when the responsible local bidder's bid exceeds the responsible non-local bidder by more than $20,000.00. 
(5)  When a bid is awarded to any bidder certifying that the bidder meets the requirements of a local bidder pursuant to this section, it shall be part of any contract with the successful bidder that the bidder agrees to indemnify and hold the village harmless for any claims that may be made against the village, its employees, officers, and agents as a result of the bidder's being awarded the bid based upon the local bidder preference. 
(6)  The local bidder preference provided for herein shall only apply if formal notice of the aforementioned criteria is provided as part of the bid specifications. 
(7)  This local bidder preference shall not apply to a bid if a funding source prohibits it through law, rule, or regulation. 
(8)  In the event of a dispute about the application of the provisions of the local bidder preference, the decision of the mayor and village board for any purchase or contract work which the mayor and village board, or their designee, are authorized to make shall be deemed final.

The owner shall be sent immediate notification of the determination by registered or certified mail that includes a complete description of the appeal process.

(1)  Evaluation of the dog by a certified applied behaviorist, a board certified veterinary behaviorist, or another recognized expert in the field and completion of training or other treatment as deemed appropriate by the expert.

Sec. 14-15. - Vicious dog. 
(a)  Vicious dog determination. In order to have a dog deemed vicious, the police chief or the department must give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the owner, conduct a thorough investigation, interview any witnesses, including the owner, gather any existing medical records, veterinary medical records or behavioral evidence, and make a detailed report recommending a finding that the dog is a vicious dog and give the report to the state's attorney's office and the owner. The police chief, the department, state's attorney, or any citizen of the county in which the dog exists may file a complaint in the circuit court to deem a dog to be a vicious dog.

A dog found to be a vicious dog shall not be released to the owner until the police chief or the department approves the enclosure. No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away the dog without court approval. Whenever an owner of a vicious dog relocates, he or she shall notify the administrator of the county animal control where he or she has relocated and the police chief and the department where the owner formerly resided. 
(f)  Enclosure. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog unless the dog is kept in an enclosure. The only times that a vicious dog may be allowed out of the enclosure are: 
(1)  If it is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary care for the dog; 
(2)  In the case of an emergency or natural disaster where the dog's life is threatened; or 
(3)  To comply with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a leash not exceeding 6 feet in length, and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the owner of the dog or muzzled in its residence. 
(g)  Impoundment. The police chief or the department shall impound any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog and which is not confined to an enclosure. If the owner of the dog has not appealed the impoundment order to the county in which the owner resides within 15 working days, the dog may be euthanized. Upon filing a notice of appeal, the order of euthanasia shall be automatically stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. The owner shall bear the burden of timely notification to the police chief and the department in writing of an appeal.

ARTICLE XVI. - SITE PLAN REVIEW 

Sec. 18-326. - Authority. 
    The village board has the authority to approve or disapprove site plans required to be submitted for approval under this section in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 2, 10-27-2014) 
Sec. 18-327. - Purpose. 
    Plan review and approval is required to ensure that the use and development of land is undertaken in a manner that furthers the public health, safety, and welfare of the village, and makes adequate provisions for public and private services and amenities that minimize the adverse effects of such development. The design, orientation, and location of buildings, parking areas, signs, and landscaping visible to the public realm has a material and substantial relationship to property values and the taxable values of property in the village, and the cost of the municipal services provided thereto. Many neighborhoods in other communities have deteriorated due to the lack of planning, neglect of proper maintenance standards, and the erection of buildings and structures that are incompatible with the character of the area, resulting in a reduction in property values. 
    Therefore, it is the policy of the village that these regulations be adopted to avoid and prevent deterioration of the function, character, and appearance of the village, and provide a favorable environment for residents and businesses, and to preserve and enhance the property values and the general public welfare. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 2, 10-27-2014) 
Sec. 18-328. - Approved plan; when required.

(2)  Application to completely redevelop any site for non-residential or multiple-family uses; 
(3)  Application to expand an existing principal structure, erected prior to the date of the adoption of this ordinance, for which the sum total of the gross floor area of the proposed expansion(s) is (are) equal to or greater than 25 percent of the existing gross floor area of said structure; 
(4)  Application to modify any new or existing building(s) and/or site improvement(s) that have previously received site plan approval under this article. Reapproval is required for components of the plan which depart from the approved site plan. The extent of changes to be incorporated in the submittal for reapproval shall be determined by the building and zoning administrator; 
(5)  A site plan shall be required along with any application for a special use permit or a special use permit amendment for any non-residential or multiple-family development; 
(6)  A site plan shall not be required exclusively for a change of use unless such change of use results in increased off-street parking requirements equal to or greater than 25 percent of the existing off-street parking; 
(7)  The requirement for site plan review excludes the reconstruction of legally nonconforming buildings, when such buildings and related improvements are substantially restored to their prior condition; 
(8)  Site plan review is not required as part of planned unit development approval, but may apply to development of individual sites following approval of a planned unit development, as controlled by the ordinance granting approval of the planned unit development.

(b)  After the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, any alarm equipment supplier who installs automatic protection devices or telephonic alarm systems for the purpose of sending prerecorded emergency messages directly to the police department shall first obtain necessary instructions, including a designated telephone number, from the communications center in order to key such devices to a special trunkline into the communications center. 
(c)  Within 60 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, all automatic protection devices or telephonic alarm systems that were keyed on that date to a primary trunkline shall be disconnected therefrom. The owner or lessee of any such device shall be responsible for the disconnecting of it. 
(d)  An owner or lessee of an automatic protection device or telephonic alarm system who has it disconnected as required by this section may authorize an alarm equipment supplier who has a temporary permit or a license as required by this article to key the automatic protection device to a special trunkline into the communications center, provided that the device meets operational requirements as set forth in this article or as required by the communications center. 
(e)  After the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, no one except an alarm equipment supplier with a temporary permit or a license from the village, as required by this article, shall install any automatic protection device or telephonic alarm system or key such device or system to a special trunkline. 
(f)  By the tenth of the second calendar month after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, every alarm equipment supplier who has keyed any automatic protection device to a special trunkline shall furnish the communications center with a current list of such installations, showing the following: 
(1)  The name, residence address and telephone number of the owner or lessee. 
(2)  The address of the place where the device is installed and the telephone number at that location. 
(3)  The name and telephone number of any other person at a different location who is authorized to respond to an emergency and open the place where the device is installed. 
Within ten days after the end of each quarter following the last month included in the initial list, every alarm equipment supplier shall furnish the communications center with a supplemental list of any such additional installations that he has keyed to a special trunkline, along with any corrections or deletions. 
(g)  Automatic protection devices or telephonic alarm systems installed on premises of any kind that are keyed to a special trunkline shall meet minimum operational requirements, as follows: 
(1)  The content of the type of recorded message to be transmitted by such device must be intelligible and in a format approved by the communications center concerned as appropriate for the nature of the alarm. 
(2)  No recorded message shall be delivered to the police department more than three times as the result of a single stimulus of the sensory mechanism. 
(3)  The length of time for transmitting the recorded message must not exceed 15 seconds. 
(4)  The time gap between delivery of each recorded message must be in the range from ten to 12 seconds. 
(5)  Such device must be capable of transmitting an alarm message to two or more recipients, so that, upon installation, any message will be sent not only on a special trunkline, but also on the line of an authorized person having a key to the premises who is available to respond to an emergency. 
(6)  The sensory mechanism used in connection with such devices must be adjusted to suppress false indications of fire or intrusion, so that the devices will not be actuated by impulses due to transient pressure changes in water pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises such as the rattling or vibrating of doors or windows, vehicular noise adjacent to the installation, or other forces unrelated to genuine alarms. 
(7)  All components comprising such a device must be maintained by the owner or lessee in good repair to ensure reliability of operation.

(i)  Each alarm equipment supplier, as referred to in subsection (h) of this section, shall also furnish the communications center with a copy of the instructions as to the way the device operates, along with a maintenance manual and a correct circuit diagram. If the communications center finds such to be incomplete, unclear or otherwise inadequate, it may require the alarm equipment supplier to have the manual and diagram revised to meet the communication center's approval and then promptly distributed to persons for whom installations of such devices have already been made, as well as to persons for whom installations are henceforth made. 
(j)  Each alarm equipment supplier that sells or leases to a person an automatic protection device which is installed on such person's premises after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and which is keyed to a special trunkline must offer service, directly or through an agent, on a 24-hour basis, seven days a week, to repair such device, so as to correct any malfunction of the device that may occur. 
(k)  At the time of installation, each alarm equipment supplier shall furnish to the person for whom an automatic protection device has been installed written information as to how service can be obtained at any time, including the telephone number to call for service; and such person shall be responsible for having the device repaired as quickly as possible after he learns, either from his own sources or from notification by the communications center or any member of the police department, that the device is not working properly. 
(l)  When messages evidencing failure to comply with the operational requirements set forth in this article are received by the communications center and the chief of the department concerned concludes that the automatic protection device sending such messages should be disconnected in order to relieve the burden of responding to false alarms, he is authorized to demand that the owner or lessee of such device, or his representative at the place where it is installed, disconnect such device until it is made to comply with the operational requirements. If disconnection of the defective automatic protection device is not accomplished promptly by such demand, and the chief of the department concerned determines that one malfunctioning device is repeatedly sending false alarms in succession without any intermittent valid alarms, he may then take whatever steps are necessary to disconnect the defective automatic protection device. 
(m)  For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, the communications center and the chief of the police department shall each have the authority, at reasonable times and upon oral notice, to enter upon any premises to inspect the installation and operation of an automatic protection device or signaling device, the purpose of which is to report an emergency to the communications center or the police department, either directly or through an intermediary.

Sec. 38-37. - Site design requirements. 
(a)  Sediment control measures. On-site sediment control measures, as specified by the following criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site: 
(1)  For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers (including filter fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures) shall be constructed to control all off-site runoff as specified in referenced handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of 25 feet, may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected. 
(2)  For disturbed areas draining more than one but less than five acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
(3)  For disturbed areas draining more than five acres, a sediment basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area. 
(4)  Sediment basin and sediment trap designs shall provide for both detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed of equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention storage and each shall be sized for the two-year, 24-hour runoff from the site under maximum runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the basin shall be that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention storage. 
(5)  The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in one year. For construction periods exceeding one year, the one-year sediment load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted. 
(b)  Stormwater conveyance channels. Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales and diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the ten-year frequency storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized within 48 hours, consistent with the following standards: 
(1)  For grades up to four percent, seeding in combination with mulch, an erosion blanket or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod or an erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel. 
(2)  For grades of four to eight percent, rock, riprap or an equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively reduced using drop structures. 
(3)  For grades greater than eight percent, rock, riprap or an equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively reduced using drop structures. 
(c)  Stabilization of disturbed areas. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within seven calendar days following the end of active disturbance, or re-disturbance, consistent with the following criteria: 
(1)  Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding, mulching, sodding and/or nonvegetative measures. 
(2)  Areas having slopes greater than 12 percent shall be stabilized with sod, a mat or a blanket in combination with seeding, or the equivalent. 
(d)  Activities disturbing stream channels. Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements shall be met: 
(1)  Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
(2)  The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized within 48 hours after channel disturbance is completed, interrupted or stopped. 
(3)  Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be constructed in the dry area and fully stabilized before flow is diverted. 
(e)  Protection of inlets and culverts. Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications. 
(f)  Soil storage piles. Soil storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of materials shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers, including straw bales, a filter fence or the equivalent shall be installed immediately on the downslope side of the piles. 
(g)  Use of dewatering devices. If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or the equivalent. 
(h)  Roads and parking areas. Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. 
(i)  Maintenance requirements. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices must be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure effective performance of their intended function. 
(j)  Removal of temporary measures. All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation. 
(Ord. No. 1186, § 1(7-7-4.K), 3-11-1998) 
Sec. 38-38. - Maintenance of control measures. 
    All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this article shall be maintained periodically by the applicant or subsequent landowner during the period of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance. 
(Ord. No. 1186, § 5(7-7-4.L), 3-11-1998) 
Sec. 38-39. - Emergency measures; special precautions. 
    If at any stage of the grading of any development site the village engineer determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, the village engineer may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions be taken as are considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. Special precautions may include but shall not be limited to a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, and installation of plant materials for erosion control.

Sec. 38-91. - Authority and purpose. 
    This article is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to villages by the Illinois Revised Statutes (Chapter 24, Sections 11-12-5-6, and 12 (subdivision regulations), 11-13-1 (zoning), 11-14-1 (setback lines) 11-30-2 and 8 (building codes), 11-105-1 (public lands), 11-109-1 (culverts, drains) 11-110-11 (drainage, flood control) and Chapter 85, Section 1711 (on-site detention). 
    The purpose of this article is to diminish threats to public health, safety, and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources. The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quality and rate and impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land as such this ordinance regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts. 
    This article is adopted to accomplish the following objectives: 
(1)  To assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(2)  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff; 
(3)  To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed basis; 
(4)  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repair to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development; 
(5)  To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
(6)  To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats; 
(7)  To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development.

(1)  When improvements are proposed to facilities built prior to May 12, 1976, the percent impervious surface will be calculated based on the entire parcel or development. If the percent impervious calculated is 50 percent or greater, than detention will be required, but only for the portion of the parcel or development being improved. 
(2)  When improvements are proposed to facilities built after May 12, 1976, where detention does not already exist, the percent impervious surface will be calculated based on the entire parcel or development. If the percent impervious calculated is 50 percent or greater, then detention will be required for the entire parcel or development. When improvements are proposed to facilities built after May 12, 1976, where detention does already exist, the percent impervious surface will be calculated based on the entire parcel or development. If the percent impervious calculated is 50 percent or greater, then detention will be required, but the additional volume required will be only for the portion of the parcel or development being improved.

(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-4), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-97. - Minimization of increase in runoff volumes and rates. 
    In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall evaluate and implement, where practicable, site design features which minimize the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The applicant's drainage plan submittal shall include evaluations of site design features which are consistent with the following hierarchy: 
(1)  Minimize impervious surfaces on the property, consistent with the needs of the project; 
(2)  Attenuate flows by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions and preserve existing natural stream channels;

(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-5), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-98. - Water quality and multiple uses. 
    The drainage system should by designed to minimize adverse water quality impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants. In particular, designers shall give preference to wet bottom and wetland designs and all flows from the development shall be routed through the basin (i.e., low flows shall not be bypassed). Retention and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants. 
    The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid using portions of the property exclusively for stormwater management. 
(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-6), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-99. - Design criteria, standards, and methods. 
(a)  Release rates. The drainage system for a property shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the two-year, 24-hour and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels which will not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. The peak discharge from events less than or equal to the two-year event shall not be greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property drained. The peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than 0. 15 cfs per acre of property drained. 
(b)  Detention basin outlet design. Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet. 
(c)  Detention storage requirements. The design maximum storage to be provided in a detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour event and reservoir (also called modified puls or level pool) routing or equal. Detention storage shall be computed using hydrograph methods as described in this section. 
(d)  Drainage system design and evaluation. The following criteria should be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity to pass the ten-year peak flow in the minor drainage system and an overload flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity. 
(1)  Design methodologies. Major and minor conveyance systems for areas up to 10 acres may be designed using the rational formula. The rational formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites. Runoff hydrograph methods as described in section 38-99 must be used for major drainage system design for all systems with greater than ten acres of drainage area and for the design of all detention basins. 
(2)  Positive drainage. Whenever practicable, all areas of the property must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a stage at least I foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the minor drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street ponding and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch. 
(e)  Methods for generating runoff hydrographs. Runoff hydrographs shall be developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and antecedent moisture. 
(1)  Rainfall. Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois State Water Survey's Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems with critical durations less than or equal to 12 hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance system with critical durations greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours. The fourth quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with durations greater than 24 hours. The first, third, and fourth quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in Table 37 of Bulletin 70. The SCS Type 11 distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff distributions. 
(2)  Antecedent moisture. Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume a conservative wet antecedent moisture condition as a minimum. 
(f)  Wet detention basin design. Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for recreational use. 
(1)  Wet basin depths. Wet basins shall be at least three feet deep, excluding nearshore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided, they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25 percent of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out. 
(2)  Wet basin shoreline slopes. The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than 5 to 1 (horizontal to vertical). 
(3)  Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the two-year event. 
(4)  Inlet and outlet orientation. To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
(g)  Wetland and dry detention basin design. In addition to the other requirements of this ordinance, wetland and dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible, to be available for multiple uses. 
(1)  Wetland and dry basin drainage. Wetland and dry basins shall be designed so that the portion of their bottom area which is intended to be dry shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement. Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the wet/wetland portion of the basin bottom from the dry portion 
(2)  Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants. 
(3)  Inlet and outlet orientation. To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. There should be no low flow bypass between the inlet and outlet and paved low flow channels shall not be used. 
(4)  Stilling/sedimentation basins. A stilling/sedimentation basin should be constructed at each major inlet to a wetland or dry basin. The volume of the basins should be at least 500 ft. per acre of impervious surface in the drainage area. Side slopes of the basins shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical and basin depths should be at least three feet to minimize resuspension of accumulated sediment. 
(h)  Detention in floodplains. The placement of detention basins within the floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention requirements of this article may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met. 
(1)  Detention in flood fringe areas. The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 1.5 times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all streamflow and floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain storage lost below the ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(2)  Detention in floodways. Detention basins shall be placed in the floodway only in accordance with section 38-99. 
(3)  On-stream detention. On-stream detention basins are discouraged but allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this ordinance with respect to water quality and control of the two-year and 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are presented in section 38-99 of this article. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger than one square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention: 
a.  Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as spawning; 
b.  Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat; 
c.  Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
d.  Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands; 
e.  Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source management program throughout the upstream watershed. 
f.  Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge; and 
g.  Shall comply with 92 Illinois Administration Code Parts 702 and 708 and the floodplain ordinance of the Village of New Lenox. 
(i)  Protection of wetlands and depressional storage areas. Wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be protected from damaging modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this article, the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands and depressional storage areas (as appropriate): 
(1)  Detention in wetlands and depressional storage areas. Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions. Existing storage and release rate characteristics of wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage. 
(2)  Sediment control. The existing wetland shall be protected during construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and shall not be filled. 
(3)  Alteration of drainage patterns. Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to the wetland. 
(4)  Detention/sedimentation. All runoff from the development shall be routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to the wetland. This basin shall be constructed before property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in section 38-97 should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland. 
(5)  Vegetated buffer strip. A buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width, preferably vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the periphery of the wetland. 
(j)  Street, parking lot, and culvert drainage. 
(1)  Streets. If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch and shall not remain flooded for more than eight hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-year event. 
(2)  Parking lots. The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any parking area shall not exceed six inches for more than four hours. 
(3)  Culvert road and driveway crossings. Sizing of culvert crossings shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the culvert. 
(k)  Infiltration practices. To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement should be located on soils in hydrologic soil groups "A" or "B" as designated by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to recharge groundwater shall not be located within 75 feet of a water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over 80 percent of a dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet above seasonally high groundwater and bedrock. 
(l)  Safety considerations. The drainage system components, especially all detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events. 
(1)  Side slopes. The side slopes of all detention basins at 100 year capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than three to one (horizontal to vertical). 
(2)  Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least four feet in width two and one-half to three feet below the normal water depth. 
(3)  Velocity. Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow. 
(4)  Overflow structures. All stormwater detention basins shall be provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate. 
(m)  Maintenance considerations. The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed sideslopes shall be designed to allow lawnmowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not feasible.) Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment shall be provided. 
(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-7), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-100. - Accommodating flows from upstream tributary areas. 
(a)  Upstream areas not meeting article requirements. Where there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of this article tributary to the applicants property, the stormwater drainage system shall be designed to transport this off site flow for the 100-year event based on the existing conditions of the tributary area. In no event however shall this flow be computed using a runoff coefficient of less than 0.35. The applicant shall compute and provide the storage volume needed for his property. This off site flow may bypass the applicants detention facility provided that the discharge location is not altered from the pre-development location of the applicants property. 
(b)  Upstream areas meeting article requirements. Where there are areas which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this ordinance tributary to the applicants property, the stormwater drainage system shall be designed to transport this off site flow based on the allowed release rate of the tributary area. The applicant shall compute and provide the storage volume needed for his property. This off site flow may bypass the applicants detention facility provided that this discharge location is not altered from the pre-development location of the applicants property. 
(c)  Release rate modification. If tributary off site flow is routed through the applicants detention facility, the allowable release rate shall be based on the combined total of the applicants property and the tributary areas. This combined release rate may be utilized whether the tributary area meets the requirements of this ordinance or not. Influent flows from undeveloped tributary areas routed through the applicants detention that exceed this combined release rate will be treated as an emergency overflow. Where tributary flows bypass the applicants detention facility, the allowable release rate will be controlled by section 38-99 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-8), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-101. - Early completion of detention facilities. 
    Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of the facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-9), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-102. - Maintenance responsibility. 
    Maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before a building permit is obtained from the village the applicant shall execute a maintenance agreement with the village guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its stormwater drainage system. The maintenance agreement shall also specifically authorize representatives of the village to enter onto the property for the purpose of inspections and maintenance of the drainage system. Such agreement shall be recorded with the recorder of deeds of Will County. The maintenance agreement shall also stipulate that if the [engineer or his representative] of the Village of New Lenox notify the property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner shall make such corrections within 30 calendar days of notification. If the corrections are not made within this time period the village may have the necessary work completed and assess the cost to the property owner. 
    The village has the option of requiring a bond to be filed by the property owner for maintenance of the stormwater drainage system. 
(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-10), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-103. - Administration. 
(a)  Inspections during construction. General site grading shall not begin until the engineer of the village has certified in writing to the applicant that any necessary detention facilities are in place and operational. The engineer of the village or his representative will also conduct periodic inspections of the work in progress to be certain that the drainage system is being built as designed. If any violations of the provisions or requirements of this ordinance are noted during such inspections, the engineer shall notify the property owner in writing of the items needing correction. The property owner shall have ten calendar days to make such corrections unless given a specific extension of time in writing by the engineer. Failure to complete such corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a violation of this article. 
(b)  Final inspection. Upon notification by the applicant that the drainage system is completed, the engineer of the village or his representative shall conduct a final inspection. If the drainage system is found to contain deficiencies which require correction, the engineer or his representative shall notify the property owner of the necessary corrections. The property owner shall correct such deficiencies within ten calendar days unless given a specific extension of time in writing by the engineer. Failure to make necessary corrections within the specified time period shall constitute a violation of this article. Upon finding that the drainage system meets the provisions and requirements of this article, the engineer shall issue in writing a notice of drainage system completion to the property owner. 
(c)  Routine inspections. All privately owned drainage systems shall be inspected by representatives of the village not less than once per year. A written report shall be filed of the results of any inspection and a copy sent to the property owner detailing any problems which need correction. 
(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-11), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-104. - Enforcement. 
    The administration and enforcement of this article shall be the responsibility of the engineering department of the village or his representatives. 
(Ord. No. 1188, § 1(9-5-12), 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 38-105. - Appeals. 
    All appeals to the director of the engineering department's decision regarding the interpretation of this article shall be heard by the village board of the village.

ARTICLE IV. - RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STREAM AND WETLAND PROTECTION[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1260, adopted Aug. 24, 1999, did not specifically amend the Code, hence; inclusion as art. IV, §§ 38-131-38-133 was at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 38-131. - Intent. 
    This article applies to development in or near streams, lakes, ponds, and wetlands within the Village of New Lenox. Streams, lakes, and ponds (including intermittent streams) are those which are shown on the United States Department of the Interior Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle maps and those additional streams, delineated on the village's comprehensive plan. Those maps are hereby made a part of this article, and two copies thereof shall remain on file in the office of the village administrator for public inspection. Within the jurisdiction of the Village of New Lenox, those waterbodies and watercourses that are named and are subject to the provisions of this article are Jackson Creek, Jackson Branch Creek, Sugar Run Creek, Hickory Creek, Marley Creek, and Spring Creek. Wetlands are those designated in the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service/Illinois Department of Conservation wetland inventory. 
    The procedures, standards and requirements contained in this article shall apply to all lots within wetlands and streams, and all lots lying wholly or in part: 
(1)  Within the special flood hazard area (SFHA) designated by the federal emergency management agency (FEMA); 
(2)  Within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) of a perennial stream or intermittent stream, the ordinary high water mark of a lake or pond, or the edge of a wetland; or 
(3)  Within depressional areas serving as floodplain or stormwater storage areas. 
(Ord. No. 1260, 8-24-1999) 
Sec. 38-132. - Minimum setback of development activity from streams, lakes, ponds, and wetlands. 
    Absolutely no development activity (except as provided below) may occur within the minimum setback which is defined as 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark of streams, lakes, and ponds, or the edge of wetlands, or within a designated depressional area. In no case shall the setback be less than the boundary of the 100-year floodway as defined by FEMA. These setback requirements do not apply to a stream in a culvert unless the stream is taken out of a culvert as part of development activity. If a culvert functions as a low-flow culvert, where water is intended to periodically flow over it, the setback requirements apply. 
    Review waiver of this article for proposed development activity within the minimum setback area will consider the following: 
(1)  Only limited filling and excavating necessary for the development of public boat launching ramps, swimming beaches, or the development of park shelters or similar structures is allowed. The development and maintenance of roads, parking lots and other impervious surfaces necessary for permitted uses are allowed only on a very limited basis, and where no alternate location outside of the setback area is available. 
(2)  Land surface modification within the minimum setback shall be permitted for the development of stormwater drainage swales between the developed area of the site (including a stormwater detention facility on the site) and a stream, lake or pond, or wetland. Detention basins within the setback are generally discouraged, unless it can be shown that resultant modifications will not impair water quality, habitat, or flood storage functions. 
(3)  No filling or excavating within wetlands is permitted except to install piers for the limited development of walkways and observation decks. Walkways and observation decks should avoid high quality wetland areas, and should not adversely affect natural areas designated in the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory or the habitat of rare or endangered species. 
(4)  Wetland area occupied by the development of decks and walkways must be mitigated by an equal area of wetland habitat improvement. 
(5)  Modification of degraded wetlands for purposes of stormwater management is permitted where the quality of the wetland is improved and total wetland acreage is preserved. Where such modification is permitted, wetlands shall be protected from the effects of increased stormwater runoff by measures such as detention or sedimentation basins, vegetated swales and buffer strips, and sediment and erosion control measures on adjacent developments. The direct entry of storm sewers into wetlands shall be avoided. 
    The applicant shall present evidence, prepared by a qualified professional, that demonstrates that the proposed development activity will not endanger health and safety, including danger from the obstruction or diversion of flood flow. The developer shall also show, by submitting appropriate calculations and resource inventories, that the proposed development activity will not substantially reduce natural floodwater storage capacity, destroy valuable habitat for aquatic or other flora and fauna, adversely affect water quality or ground water resources, increase stormwater runoff velocity so that water levels on other lands are substantially raised or the danger from flooding increased, or adversely impact any other natural stream, floodplain, or wetland functions, and is otherwise consistent with the intent of this article. 
    In addition to locating all site improvements on the subject property to minimize adverse impacts on the stream, lake, pond, or wetland, the applicant shall install a berm, curb or other physical barrier during construction, and following completion of the project, where necessary, to prevent direct runoff and erosion from any modified land surface into a stream, lake, pond, or wetland. All parking and vehicle circulation areas should be located as far as possible from a stream, lake, pond or wetland. 
    The Village of New Lenox may limit development activity in or near a stream, lake, pond, or wetland to specific months, and to a maximum number of continuous days or hours, in order to minimize adverse impacts. Also, the Village of New Lenox may require that equipment be operated from only one side of a stream, lake, or pond in order to minimize bank disruption. Other development techniques, conditions, and restrictions ma be required in order to minimize adverse impacts on streams, lakes, ponds, or wetlands, and on any related areas not subject to development activity. 
(Ord. No. 1260, 8-24-1999) 
Sec. 38-133. - Natural vegetation buffer strip required. 
    To minimize erosion, stabilize the stream bank, protect water quality, maintain water temperature at natural levels, preserve fish and wildlife habitat, to screen manmade structures, and also to preserve aesthetic values of the natural watercourse and wetland areas, a natural vegetation strip shall be maintained along the edge of the stream, lake, pond or wetland. The natural vegetation strip shall extend landward a minimum of 25 feet from the ordinary high water mark of a perennial or intermittent stream, lake, or pond and the edge of a wetland. These guidelines are outlined in the publication "Native Plant Guide for Streams and Stormwater Facilities in Northeastern Illinois" jointly published by the Fish & Wildlife Service, NRCS, IEPA, and Army Corps of Engineers. 
    Within the natural vegetation strip, trees and shrubs may be selectively pruned or removed for harvest of merchantable timber, to achieve a filtered view of the waterbody from the principal structure, to control the spread of undesirable invasive species such as buckthrow or box elder, to restore a balanced community of native plant species, and for reasonable private access to the stream, lake, pond or wetland. Said pruning and removal activities shall ensure that a live root system stays intact to provide for stream bank stabilization and erosion control.

Any person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. 
In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the public works superintendent is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The village is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in section 38-185. 
(b)  Warning notice. When the public works superintendent finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the public works superintendent may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieve the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the village to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice. 
(c)  Notice of violation. Whenever the public works superintendent finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the public works superintendent may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. The notice of violation shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the alleged violator; 
(2)  The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred; 
(3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
(4)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore compliance with this article and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action; 
(5)  A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed; 
(6)  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to a committee of the village board by filing a written notice of appeal within ten business days of service of notice of violation; and 
(7)  A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
Such notice may require without limitation: 
(1)  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
(2)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
(3)  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
(4)  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property 
(5)  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
(6)  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
(d)  Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this article, the public works superintendent may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. 
(e)  Suspension of MS4 access. 
(1)  Emergency cease and desist orders. When the public works superintendent finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the public works superintendent may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
a.  Immediately comply with all village requirements; and 
b.  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(2)  Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the public works superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The public works superintendent may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the public works superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this article. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the public works department within five business days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(3)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The public works superintendent may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the public works superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(4)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The public works superintendent will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition a committee of the village board for a reconsideration and hearing. 
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the public works superintendent. 
(f)  Civil penalties. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within five business days, or such greater period as the public works superintendent shall deem appropriate, after the village has taken one or more of the actions described above, in addition to all other remedies, the violator shall be sentenced as provided in section 1-15 of this Code for each offense and for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(g)  Criminal prosecution. Any person that has violated or continues to violate this article shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of up to $750.00 per violation per day and/or imprisonment for a period of time not to exceed 30 days. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.

If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the public works superintendent or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
    Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the village by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than 12 equal payments. 
    Interest at the rate of five percent per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the thirtieth day following discovery of the violation.

    Structure means the results of a manmade change to the land constructed on or below the ground, including the construction, reconstruction or placement of a building or any addition to a building, installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure, either before the improvement or repair is started, or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Transition section means reaches of the stream or floodway where water flows from a narrow cross section to a wide cross section, or vice versa.

Sec. 46-33. - Determination of base flood elevation. 
(a)  This article's protection standard is based on the Countywide Flood Insurance Study for Will County, Illinois, and Incorporated Areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated September 6, 1995. If the base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey's Flood Plain Information Repository. When a party disagrees with the best available data, he may finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the division of water resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(b)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the special flood hazard areas of Hickory Creek and Jackson Branch Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Countywide Flood Insurance Study of Will County, Illinois, and Incorporated Areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated September 6, 1995, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(c)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the special flood hazard areas of those parts of the unincorporated area of the county that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Countywide Flood Insurance Study of Will County, Illinois, and Incorporated Areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated September 6, 1995, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(d)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each special flood hazard area delineated as an AH zone or AO zone shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Maps of Will County, Illinois, and Incorporated Areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated September 6, 1995. 
(e)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining special flood hazard areas delineated as an A zone on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Maps of Will County, Illinois, and Incorporated Areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated September 6, 1995, shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey Flood Plain Information Repository. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine special flood hazard area shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-11 or WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-1, TR-20 or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans. Along any watercourse draining more than one square mile, these analyses should be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Flood Plain Information Repository for filing. For a non-riverine special flood hazard area, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the Illinois State Water Survey. 
(Code 1981, § 9-6-5) 
Sec. 46-34. - Requirements applicable to all floodplain areas. 
    In addition to the requirements found in divisions 3, 4 and 5 of this article for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways, and special flood hazard areas or floodplains where no floodways have been identified (zone A, AO, AH, AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M or E), the following requirements shall be met: 
(1)  Public health standards. 
a.  Storage of hazardous or toxic materials. No developments in the special flood hazard area shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants or other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection elevation. 
b.  Water supply and waste disposal facilities. New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other aboveground openings located below the flood protection elevation are watertight. 
(2)  Maintenance of flood-carrying capacity; notification of alteration of watercourse. For all projects involving channel modification, fill or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities in writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse. 
(3)  Protection of buildings. 
a.  Applicability. All buildings located within a 100-year floodplain, also known as a special flood hazard area, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation. However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in division 4 of this article. This building protection criteria applies to the following situations: 
1.  Construction or placement of new building. 
2.  A structural alteration to an existing building that either increases the first floor area by more than 20 percent or the building's market value by more than 50 percent. 
3.  Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site. This building protection requirement does not apply to returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage. 
4.  Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days. 
b.  Methods. This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following methods: 
1.  Construction on landfill. A residential or nonresidential building, when allowed, may be constructed on permanent landfill in accordance with the following: 
i.  The lowest floor (including basement) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation. 
ii.  The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation. However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties. 
2.  Elevation. A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in accordance with the following: 
i.  The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl spaces, stilts, piles, walls or other foundation that is permanently open to floodwater and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above grade and consist of a minimum of two openings. The openings must have a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood elevation. 
ii.  The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice and floating areas. 
iii.  All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement) and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located at or above the flood protection elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps and other waterproofed service facilities may be located below the flood protection elevation. 
iv.  No area below the flood protection elevation shall be used for storage of items or materials. 
v.  Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than 180 days shall be elevated to or above the flood protection elevation, and shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the Rules and Regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act issued pursuant to 77 Illinois Administrative Code 870. 
3.  Floodproofing. Only a nonresidential building may be structurally dry floodproofed (in lieu of elevation), provided that a registered professional engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation, and the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity (levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection). 
4.  Nonconforming structures. Nonconforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may remain in use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered. A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or manmade disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds 50 percent of its market value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this article. 
(Code 1981, § 9-6-9) 
Sec. 46-35. - Standards for review and approval of subdivisions and other development. 
(a)  The village board of trustees shall take into account flood hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions related to land management, use and development. 
(b)  New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements and planned unit developments (PUDs) within the special flood hazard area shall be reviewed to ensure that the proposed developments are consistent with section 46-34 and divisions 3, 4 and 5 of this article and the need to minimize flood damage. Plats or plans for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks and planned unit developments shall include a signed statement by a registered professional engineer that the plat or plans account for changes in the drainage of surface water in accordance with the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/1 et seq.). 
(c)  Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, travel trailer parks, planned unit developments, additions to manufactured home parks and additions to subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation data and floodway delineations. Where this information is not available from an existing study filed with the Illinois State Water Survey, the applicant's engineer shall be responsible for calculating the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation per section 46-33(e) and the floodway delineation per the definition in section 46-32 and submitting it to the state water survey and the division of water resources for review and approval as best available regulatory data. 
(d)  Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and channels. Wherever possible, the floodplains shall be included within parks or other public grounds. 
(e)  The village board of trustees shall not approve any planned unit development or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits unless such agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Code 1981, § 9-6-10) 
Sec. 46-36. - Disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the special flood hazard area, will be free from flooding or damage. This article does not create liability on the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this article or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
(Code 1981, § 9-6-12) 
Sec. 46-37. - Abrogation of existing agreements; conflicting regulations. 
    This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this article and other ordinances, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. This article is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was adopted to meet the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, but is not intended to repeal the resolution which the village passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program.

Sec. 46-61. - Generally. 
(a)  The village engineer shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in section 46-62. To fulfill those duties, the village engineer first should use the criteria listed in section 46-33, pertaining to base flood elevations, to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. 
(b)  Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the village engineer must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, within a regulatory floodway, or within a special flood hazard area or floodplain on which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the village engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of division 3 of this article be met. If the site is within a floodway, the village engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of division 4 of this article be met. If the site is located within a special flood hazard area or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the village engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of division 5 of this article be met.

(Code 1981, § 9-6-7.A.2) 
Sec. 46-104. - Appropriate uses; development standards. 
(a)  Appropriate uses. The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Illinois Administrative Code 708 will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined in this subsection as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
(1)  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion or water quality, or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
(2)  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as facilities and improvements relating to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water-dependent uses. 
(3)  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls. 
(4)  Underground and overhead utilities. 
(5)  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions. 
(6)  Bridges, culverts, roadways (other than those running longitudinally along a watercourse), sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways, and any modifications thereto. 
(7)  Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse. 
(8)  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures, including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
(9)  In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced and which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building. 
(10)  Additions to existing buildings above the base flood elevation that do not increase the building's footprint and are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the building. 
(b)  Development standards; engineering and mitigation criteria. Within the regulatory floodways as identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by the division of water resources, the construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and this is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer, and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 46-34: 
(1)  Preservation of flood conveyance so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
a.  Regulatory floodway conveyance is calculated as follows: 
K = 1.486 / n A(R) 2/3 
where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross section and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.) 
b.  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state or local unit of government can ensure that the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
c.  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to the division of water resources through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
1.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
2.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
3.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
4.  Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
5.  All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
(2)  Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the existing ten-year flood elevation. All regulatory flood elevation storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to the division of water resources through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at an existing structure. 
(3)  Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the proposed work shall not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, in the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures. 
(4)  Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event, or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact the division of water resources, dam safety section, for a dam safety permit or waiver. 
a.  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 46-33. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, Federal Highway Administration's Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, Federal Highway Administration's Hydraulics of Bridge Water calculation procedures. 
b.  Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
c.  Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection (b)(3) of this section. 
d.  If the crossing is proposed over public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a department of transportation permit must be received. 
e.  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to the division of water resources for concurrence that a conditional letter of map revision is not required by this section. 
f.  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection (b)(8) of this section. 
(5)  Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts and approach roads. 
a.  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than a 0.1-foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
b.  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
c.  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with the Department of Transportation Rules, 92 Illinois Administrative Code 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to the division for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
(6)  On-stream structures built for purpose of backing up water. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero feet when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event, shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. A permit, or a letter indicating that a permit is not required, must be obtained from the division of water resources, dam safety section, for a dam safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 46-32 shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Illinois Administrative Code 702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
a.  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation or regional stormwater detention. 
b.  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning. 
c.  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin. 
d.  A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control. 
e.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this division. 
(7)  Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
(8)  Excavation in floodway. When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless the applicant's engineer can prove to the division of water resources through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
a.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
b.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
c.  When expanding or contracting flow is in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
d.  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland, upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
(9)  Channel modifications. If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
a.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channels, or the establishment of a streamside buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. 
b.  Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values. 
c.  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
2.  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
3.  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
4.  Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
5.  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
6.  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. An erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
7.  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
8.  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
9.  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry area and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
10.  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
11.  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification. 
d.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this division. 
(10)  Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
(11)  Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
a.  The construction areas shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
b.  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
c.  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off-site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches and sediment basins. 
d.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing channels (see subsection (b)(16) of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
e.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois (1988), also known as the "Green Book," and Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (IEPA, 1987). 
(12)  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this division will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to the division of water resources through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
(13)  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
a.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study referenced in section 46-33 must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, the division of water resources shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
b.  If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this division for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
c.  If the applicant learns from the division of water resources, local governments or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed or modified or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this division for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
(14)  Conditional letter of map revision. If the appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to the division of water resources and to the Federal Emergency Management Agency all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by the division of water resources until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the division of water resources. In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before division of water resources approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision is issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the division of water resources. 
(15)  Supervision of engineering analyses. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
(16)  Construction within 25 feet of channel. For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
a.  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of the channel. 
b.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
c.  The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for stream maintenance purposes. 
After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by the division of water resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the as-built plans. 
(c)  State review. For those projects listed in this subsection located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to the division of water resources for its review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit: 
(1)  The division of water resources will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
(2)  The division of water resources will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection (b)(5) of this section. 
(3)  The division of water resources will review alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to subsections (b)(1), (2) and (8) of this section. 
(4)  The division of water resources will review and approve prior to the start of construction any department projects, dams (as defined in section 46-32) and all other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the municipality or county. 
(d)  State permits. In addition to the other requirements of this article, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit, or written documentation that a permit is not required, from the division of water resources, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. No permit from the division of water resources shall be required if the division has delegated this responsibility to the village. 
(e)  Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in section 46-32 per 92 Illinois Administrative Code 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain a division of water resources dam safety permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the village engineer finds a dam that does not have a division of water resources permit, the village engineer shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the division of water resources. If the village engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the village engineer shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the division of water resources, the dam safety section in Springfield and the state emergency management agency. 
(f)  Activities permitted without review by registered professional engineer. The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article, including the mitigation requirements. 
(1)  Underground and overhead utilities such that: 
a.  The utilities do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; 
b.  The utilities do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway; or 
c.  In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing stream bed; and 
d.  In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and towers are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris. 
(2)  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that: 
a.  Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope; 
b.  Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and 
c.  Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall location. 
(3)  Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences), properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade. 
(4)  Construction of shoreline and stream bank protection such that: 
a.  The construction does not exceed 1,000 feet in length. 
b.  Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank. 
c.  Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake. 
Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
(5)  Temporary stream crossings in which: 
a.  The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above natural grade. 
b.  The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or outfall invert. 
c.  The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
d.  All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of construction. 
e.  The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization.

DIVISION 5. - OCCUPATION AND USE OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS ARE NOT IDENTIFIED 

Sec. 46-121. - Generally. 
    In special flood hazard areas or floodplains (including AO zones, AH zones or unnumbered A zones) where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposal, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwater or significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
(Code 1981, § 9-6-8.A) 
Sec. 46-122. - Development permit. 
    No person not exempted by state law shall commence any development in a special flood hazard area or floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the village engineer. Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the village engineer. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions; existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section 46-34. The application for a development permit shall also include the following information: 
(1)  A detailed description of the proposed activity and its purpose and intended use shall be included. 
(2)  Site location (including legal description) of the property shall be included, drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area. 
(3)  Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity shall be stated. 
(4)  Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a minimum: 
a.  A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, the name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic or numerical scale and north arrow; 
b.  A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions, including principal dimensions of the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment) datum or NGVD, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, distance between the proposed activity and the navigation channel (when the proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross sections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale; 
c.  Cross-sectional views of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions, including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, ten-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and 
d.  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance. 
(5)  Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of section 46-125. 
(6)  Any and all other local, state and federal permits or approvals that may be required for this type of development shall be included. 
(Code 1981, § 9-6-8.A.1) 
Sec. 46-123. - Determination of elevation. 
    Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois State Water Survey's Flood Plain Information Repository, the village engineer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to section 46-33(e). Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the special flood hazard area and therefore not subject to the requirements of this article. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(Code 1981, § 9-6-8.A.2) 
Sec. 46-124. - Other permits and approvals. 
    The village engineer shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for the type of activity regulated by this division. The village engineer shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(Code 1981, § 9-6-8.A.3) 
Sec. 46-125. - Development standards. 
(a)  Generally. No development in the special flood hazard area where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. 
(b)  Riverine special flood hazard areas. Within all riverine special flood hazard areas where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  Engineering study. The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of section 46-104(b)(1) through (12) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the provisions of section 46-33(e). As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to the division of water resources for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of the floodway by the department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of division 4 of this article for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to the definition in section 46-32. 
(2)  State permit. A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit from the division of water resources or obtains written documentation that a permit is not required from the division of water resources. 
(3)  Delegation of permit responsibility to village. No permit from the division of water resources shall be required if the division has delegated permit responsibility to the village per 92 Illinois Administrative Code, part 708, for regulatory floodways, per the division of water resources statewide permit entitled "Construction in Flood Plains with No Designated Floodways in Northeastern Illinois." 
(4)  Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water as defined in section 46-32 shall obtain an state division of water resources dam safety permit, or a letter indicating that a permit is not required, prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the village engineer finds a dam that does not have a division of water resources permit, the village engineer shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the division of water resources. If the village engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the village engineer shall immediately notify the owner of the dam and the state emergency management agency, and the division of water resources, dam safety section, in Springfield. 
(5)  Activities permitted without review by registered professional engineer. The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and regulatory floodway, but such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article: 
a.  Underground and overhead utilities such that: 
1.  The utilities do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; 
2.  The utilities do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway; or 
3.  In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing streambed; and 
4.  In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and towers are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris. 
b.  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that: 
1.  Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope; 
2.  Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and 
3.  Are designed so as not to cause stream bank erosion at the outfall location. 
c.  Construction of shoreline and streambed protection such that: 
1.  The construction does not exceed 1,000 feet in length or two cubic yards per linear foot of streambed. 
2.  Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank. 
3.  Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel by more than ten percent. 
Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions should be avoided unless there are not practicable alternatives. 
d.  Temporary stream crossings in which: 
1.  The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above natural grade. 
2.  The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or outfall invert. 
3.  The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
4.  All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of construction. 
5.  The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization. 
e.  The construction of light poles, signposts and similar structures. 
f.  The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic fields (excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are built at grade. 
g.  The construction of properly anchored, unwalled, open structures such as playground equipment, pavilions and carports built at or below existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of floodwater. 
h.  The placement of properly anchored buildings not exceeding 70 square feet in size or ten feet in any one dimension (e.g., animal shelters and tool sheds). 
i.  The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not increase the first floor area by more than 20 percent, which are located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and which do not extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the flow of floodwater. 
j.  Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where: 
1.  The affected length of stream is less than 1,000 feet. 
2.  The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural stream channels. 
3.  The cross-sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site. 
(6)  Maintenance of flood-carrying capacity. The flood-carrying capacity within any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
(c)  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

In the event village demands payment and payment is made for a subdivision in which public improvements are estimated at $500,000.00 or more, said fees shall be deducted from the four percent plan review and construction inspection fee collected at the time of execution of the final plat. 
(b)  Special hearing dates. The filing fees required by subsection (a) of this section shall be applicable if the appropriate hearing upon such submission is to be conducted on the same evening which is a regular meeting date of the appropriate village authority involved, whether the meeting is to be held before the plan commission or the zoning board of appeals. If the hearing is to be held before the appropriate village authority at any time other than a regular meeting date, then the filing fees shall be applicable and such petition shall be accompanied by a $400.00 special meeting fee for preliminary subdivision plat. The plan commission, at its sole discretion, shall determine the date on which it shall conduct a hearing on the proposed plat of subdivision, and it shall cause appropriate legal notices and public meeting notifications to be published and posted as provided for in the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as revised. 
(c)  Hearings before more than one agency. If the village is required to conduct hearings before both the plan commission and zoning board of appeals with respect to multiple matters concerning the same tract of land, i.e., multiple zoning changes on a single tract, rezoning request and subdivision plat approval for the same tract, etc., and the hearings can be held on the same date, the petitioner shall be entitled to have the hearings held upon his payment of the filing fee and security deposit for one such hearing; provided that the plan commission and zoning board are composed of substantially the same members and the meetings are held on the same date. In all other circumstances, the petitioner will be required to make separate payment for each initial hearing.

Sec. 78-52. - Procedure for approval. 
(a)  Hearing before plan commission. The plan commission shall provide for an adequate hearing on the preliminary plat and shall notify the applicant by mail at least five days prior to the hearing. 
(b)  Action by plan commission. 
(1)  The commission shall determine whether the preliminary plat shall be approved, approved with modifications, or disapproved, and shall give written notice to the subdivider of its determination within 90 days of the initial hearing. 
(2)  If approved, the commission shall so note on the face of the plat, and shall thereupon forward the plat to the village board, notifying the subdivider of the action. If approved with modifications, or if disapproved, the commission shall attach to the original plat a statement of the reasons for such action and shall return the original of the plat to the subdivider, retaining one copy thereof for its records. 
(c)  Effect of approval by plan commission; time limits. 
(1)  The approval of a preliminary plat by the plan commission is strictly tentative, involving merely the general acceptability of the layout submitted. This approval shall be effective for a maximum period of 12 months, provided that: 
a.  The subdivider shall, within a six-month period of preliminary plat approval, present to the village board a written status report of the progress of the proposed subdivision; and 
b.  The subdivider shall, within 12 months, obtain the plan commission's and village board's approval of the final plat on an area comprising at least 20 percent of the gross area encompassed in the preliminary plat. 
(2)  If final plat approval is not obtained on at least 20 percent of the gross area within 12 months, then the preliminary plat is deemed to have expired. In addition, the subdivider shall obtain final plat approval (on increments of at least 20 percent of the preliminary plat) in succeeding 12-month periods until the subdivision is completed. 
(3)  The village board may, upon the application of the subdivider within the time periods specified in this subsection, grant such extensions of time as it shall deem proper. 
(d)  Action by village board. The village board shall, upon receipt of the report from the plan commission and four copies of the preliminary plat, upon motion and majority vote, approve or disapprove the preliminary plat, and, if approved, give permission to prepare detailed plans and specifications of the subdivision and public improvements in accordance with the preliminary plat, and within the requirements of this chapter. 
(e)  Effect of approval by board. The approval of a preliminary plat by the village board is tentative only, involving merely the general acceptability of the layout as submitted, and must have designated thereon the words "This is a preliminary plat, of no legal effect, and not to be recorded." 
(f)  Revisions. The plan commission may recommend or the village board may require, during consideration of a preliminary plat, such changes or revisions as are deemed necessary in the interest and needs of the community. 
(g)  Proper drainage required. No plat will be approved for the subdivision of land which is subject to periodic flooding or which contains extremely poor drainage facilities and which would make adequate drainage of the streets impossible. However, if the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the village engineer, make the area completely safe for residential occupancy and provide adequate street drainage, the preliminary plat of the subdivision may be approved. 
(h)  Distribution of signed copies. One print of the approved preliminary plat, signed by the president and the village clerk, shall be retained in the village clerk's office, and two copies shall be retained in the office of the village engineer, and one copy shall be retained in the files of the plan commission. One signed copy is authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of plans and specifications for the minimum improvements required in these rules and regulations and with the preparation of the final plat.

The digital format shall be the latest version of AutoCAD software approved by the village. The digital deliverables shall be on 31/2-inch diskettes. 
(2)  This subsection shall serve as the drafting standards for CAD submittals. The goal of this standard is to produce legible drawing sets for construction and an accurate, full-size computer model of the project being built. This full-size computer model shall be inserted into the village's base map upon village approval of the computer file. 
(3)  The model shall be prepared using the village's mapping control for a horizontal and vertical coordinate base. The model shall be drafted at full scale in the village's horizontal coordinate system. Model files shall contain all existing and proposed entities contained in the entire set of construction plans, and shall encompass the entire project being designed.

Surveyors and engineers finding destroyed village control monumentation or recovery ties are required to notify the village. 
Editor's note- The preceding subsection 78-71(d), as established by Ord. No. 1097, shall be in effect and shall apply to any preliminary subdivision plat, final subdivision plat and/or engineering plans submitted after September 1, 1996. 
(e)  Review and approval by village engineer. 
(1)  The final plat and accompanying documents shall be submitted to the village engineer. The village engineer shall review the final plat and accompanying documents for conformance with the preliminary plat, as approved by the plan commission and the village board. 
(2)  If the final plat and accompanying documents are in conformance with the preliminary plat and the requirements of this chapter, the village engineer may approve the final plat and accompanying documents by affixing his signature to the certificate of approval on the final plat and forwarding these documents to the plan commission. 
(f)  Review and approval by plan commission. The plan commission shall review the final plat and accompanying documents by directing the chairman and secretary to affix their signatures in appropriate places on the certificate of approval on the final plat and forwarding these documents to the village board. The plan commission's approval shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the public of the dedication of any street or other proposed public way or space shown in the plat. 
(g)  Submission of copies to village board; deposit for guarantee of improvements. After approval of the final plat and accompanying documents and the forwarding of these documents to the village board by the plan commission, the subdivider and owner shall submit to the village board: 
(1)  One tracing and one copy of the final plat of the subdivision as executed by the plan commission shall be submitted, drawn in ink on tracing cloth. Following execution by the president and village clerk, the subdivider shall provide 15 copies of such final plat bearing the required signatures. 
(2)  A deposit of 15 percent of the estimated cost of surface improvements is to be given to the village prior to any reduction in the subdivider's letter of credit covering surface improvements. Such deposit may be in cash, a bearer negotiable instrument or a negotiable instrument payable to the village, as approved by the village board. The village will hold this deposit in escrow for a period of 18 months after the final completion of such work as a guarantee against any defect in the material or workmanship furnished in connection with such improvement latent in character and not discernible at the time of the final approval of such improvement, and to guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof. After the termination of such 18-month period, such deposit shall be refunded to the depositor, or the order of such depositor, if no defects have developed. If any defects have developed, then the balance of such deposit shall be refunded after reimbursement of the village for any amounts expended by it in the curing of such defects. 
(h)  That in any case when village funds have been expended to finance the advance construction of public improvements that would have otherwise been a requirement of this title for the subdivision of land, reimbursement to the village for these costs shall be required as a condition of subdivision final plat approval. Only costs of public improvements that are adjacent to and directly benefiting the property to be subdivision are eligible for reimbursement. Furthermore, the costs of usual and customary maintenance including the improvement of existing infrastructure shall not be considered a reimbursable cost as defined in this section. Said reimbursement amount shall be determined by the village engineer. 
(Code 1981, § 11-4-1; Ord. No. 1194, § 1(11-4-1C9), 4-28-1998; Ord. No. 1316, § 1, 10-24-2000) 
Sec. 78-72. - Reservation of land for public use. 
(a)  Residential subdivisions . 
(1)  Dedications required. As a condition of approval of a final plat of a residential subdivision or planned unit development, each subdivider or developer shall be required to dedicate land and/or make cash contributions in lieu of land and pay other impact fees to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the village as set forth in this section. 
(2)  Dedication of land sites and open space. Land sites and/or other open space contributions shall be conveyed to the village fee simple in accordance with the following criteria. The village may subsequently dedicate or lease such land to any local park district, forest preserve district, fire protection district, or library district. 
a.  Required dedication area. The ultimate number of residents that will be generated by the proposed subdivision or planned unit development shall be determined in accordance with table 1 in subsection (c) of this section. The land area required to be dedicated for land sites and/or open space in each subdivision or planned unit development shall be determined by dividing the estimated population of such subdivision or planned unit development by 1,000 and multiplying the quotient by the acre contribution required for each 1,000 people as set forth in the following schedule: 
District Acres/1,000 population Park District 10.0 Village 4.5 Fire District 2.3 Library District 1.2 Police Communications 0.5  
b.  Location of land sites. 
1.  Except for combined multijurisdictional sites, as made by prior agreement, or as defined in the comprehensive plan adopted by the village, the location of sites dedicated pursuant to this section shall be approved by the village board, provided that the village board must give any and all affected park district board(s), county forest preserve district board(s), fire protection district board(s), and/or library district board(s) an opportunity to submit written recommendations regarding the location of such sites. 
If there is not a planned park within the subdivision or planned unit development or the neighborhood in which the subdivision or planned unit development is located, the park site and/or open space contribution shall be so located as to be readily accessible to the people within such neighborhood. Planned athletic fields and large park sites must be conveniently accessible to the community at large. 
2.  Proper modes of ingress and egress and appropriate curb cuts shall be provided for all land sites required under this section. 
For water areas: provisions must be made for pathways or driveways around such water areas for emergency vehicles and police patrols. Provisions for major use of pathways or driveways for bike riding, walkways, jogging trails and pedestrian traffic shall also be made. 
c.  Environmental quality and suitability of land. 
1.  Land to be dedicated for land sites and/or open space shall be approved by the village board according to its environmental quality, as well as its suitability for active and passive recreational activities, village facilities, fire protection facilities and/or library facilities. The land is to be dry and usable at all times and not subject to flooding or used as detention. 
2.  Should a land dedication include a detention/retention area over and above the required minimum acres per 1,000 of ultimate population estimated to be generated by the development, said land may be accepted. No bogs or swamps shall be acceptable as required land dedications. Lakes and native prairie wetlands shall not normally be acceptable, but may be approved where the area offers an exceptional amenity or the chance to protect a significant natural resource. Sites that have been part of an unlicensed landfill or a toxic waste dump shall not be acceptable as required land dedications. 
3.  Every effort shall be made to conserve for public use and enjoyment those areas of significant natural and environmental value. The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site, as well as its surroundings, must be suitable for its intended purpose and approved prior to approval of the final plat. Grading on sites dedicated for public use shall not greatly differ from the surrounding land and shall be provided with erosion control devices as required by state or village regulations prior to acceptance by the village board. Except in those specific areas designated by the village for development as playfields or other active areas, all trees, other plant materials, streams, and other natural features shall be retained on land to be dedicated for public use, unless specifically cited by the village for removal by the developer. 
d.  Shape of site. Dedicated land sites and/or open space contributions shall be regularly configured to permit efficient programming, security and maintenance. Sites shall be rectangular or nearly rectangular in shape, with no interior angle of the boundary line less than 60 degrees, unless specifically approved by the village. Narrow strips of land, small parcels that intrude into adjacent orderly development, and leftover parcels that are oddly shaped or located shall not be accepted as part of the required land dedication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village may accept easements or land dedications for linear parks and/or multi-use trails as determined by the village board. 
e.  Improvements. 
1.  Prior to conveyance, all sites shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter and any water retention/detention requirements set forth in this Code, except as varied by the specific terms of this section. In addition, if a land site and/or open space contribution includes any retention/detention areas, slopes must be mowable and shall not exceed a 5:1 slope. For any area where-by necessity and subject to the approval of the village board-the grade of such slopes exceeds 5:1, the subdivider or developer must provide a covering of paving or vegetative cover (as recommended by the village board or other applicable agency) which will eliminate the need to mow. All other areas must be final graded and seeded to meet village specifications, provided that the village shall allow any affected park district board(s), county forest preserve district board(s), fire protection district board(s), and/or library district board(s) to make recommendations as to seed mixture. 
2.  All sites shall be conveyed in a condition ready for full service of electricity, water, sewers, and streets, including enclosed drainage, curb, and gutter improvements as applicable to the location of the site, or after acceptable provision has been made therefor. In addition, location of hydrants shall be made in conformance with village requirements. Provision for water for watering vegetation and flooding for ice skating shall be made where appropriate. Sewer stubs allowing for the future installation of buildings, restrooms, and/or shelters shall be provided. All connection fees for water and sewer service shall be paid by the developer at time of final plat, and prior to conveyance of the site to the village. 
3.  If a dedicated land site or open space contribution accepted by the village is adjacent to an existing residential developed area, certain landscaping and/or screening may be required of the developer, at his cost, to be installed prior to the conveyance of the land site or open space contribution to the village. 
(3)  Reservation of additional land. Where the comprehensive plan of the village calls for park and/or recreational land in a particular proposed subdivision or planned unit development over and above the requirements of this section, the subdivider or developer shall reserve any and all such land for the subsequent purchase by the village or park district, provided that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of the final plat. If the village or park district fails to make such acquisition within one year from the date of the final plat, this subsection (a)(3) shall cease to apply to the subdivision or planned use development that is the subject of said plat. 
(4)  Combined multijurisdictional school/park/village sites. Consideration will be given to combined school/park/village sites. Where the village determines that such a combined school/park/village site is appropriate, the total land area dedication required shall be equal to the sum of the land area dedication required by this section and the land area dedication required by article V of this chapter (pertaining to dedication of school sites). If the subdivision or planned unit development cannot reasonably be expected to provide the total land area required under this subsection (a)(4), then the village shall determine what land area dedication is reasonable and appropriate and the subdivider or developer shall pay the difference between the total required dedication area and the actual area dedicated in the form of cash contributions as determined under subsection (a)(7) of this section. 
In addition, if the total land needed for a combined school/park/village site exceeds the total land area dedication requirement as set out in this subsection (a)(4), the subdivider or developer shall reserve any necessary additional land area in the same manner, and under the same conditions, as set forth in subsection (a)(3) of this section, supra. 
(5)  Time of conveyance of dedications. 
a.  All required dedications shall be conveyed to the village in fee simple for subsequent conveyance or lease to the appropriate taxing district in which the land is located. Land dedications shall be conveyed by the developer no later than the earlier of the following: 
1.  Within 180 days after a written demand by the village; or 
2.  By the second anniversary of the approval of the final plat of the subdivision or planned unit development by the village. 
b.  All land dedications shall be improved as required under subsection (a)(2)e., supra, prior to conveyance to the village, but in no event no later than the earlier of the following: 
1.  Within 180 days after a written demand by the village; or 
2.  By the second anniversary of the approval of the final plat of the subdivision or planned unit development by the village. 
(6)  Title insurance, survey and assessment plats. Each deed conveying land to the village shall be accompanied by the following: 
a.  A written commitment issued by a title insurer licensed to do business within this state to ensure that the village has good merchantable title to any and all dedicated real estate in an amount equal to the total area of the land dedication multiplied by the then-applicable fair market value as set forth in subsection (a)(7)c., supra, subject only to then-current general real estate taxes as of the date of transfer; covenants, conditions, and restrictions which do not prohibit the use of the subject real estate for park, village, fire protection, or library uses; and utility easements located within 20 feet of the boundary lines of the subject real estate for drainage ditches, feeders, laterals, and underground pipes or other conduits. 
b.  A current boundary line survey, certified by a licensed Illinois land surveyor to be in compliance with the state land survey standards. 
c.  Except in instances where the real estate to be conveyed is a lot in a recorded subdivision, an assessment plat and tax division petition in a form acceptable to the appropriate county authorities so that the land to be conveyed can be assigned its own permanent real estate index number for exemption purposes. 
(7)  Cash contribution in lieu of dedication of land. Criteria for requiring cash contributions in lieu of land dedications are as follows: 
a.  Authority to require cash contribution. Upon a determination of the village board, and as may be recommended by the park district board, county forest preserve district board, fire protection district board, or library district board, that the required land dedication will not be large enough; that the required land dedication is otherwise inappropriate for the purpose intended; or that cash contributions will be more advantageous, the village board shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the required land dedication as described in this subsection. 
b.  Intended use. The cash contributions to be paid in lieu of a land dedication shall be expended by the receiving taxing district as prescribed by law. 
c.  Amount of contribution. 
1.  Fair market value. The amount of cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fully improved fair market value of land in the proposed subdivision or planned unit development. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated. It has been determined that the present "fair market value" of such improved land in and surrounding the village is $110,000.00 per acre as of January 1, 2018, and further that it is hereby established for each year effective on January 1 as follows: 
Year Fair Market Value 2018 $110,000.00 2019 115,500.00 2020 121,275.00 2021 127,339.00 2022 133,705.00 2023 140,391.00 2024 147,410.00 2025 154,781.00 2026 162,520.00  
The values set forth in the above table shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider or developer of a planned unit development files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection, the subdivider or developer of a planned unit development shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market value" of such improved land in the area of his subdivision or planned unit development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said "fair market value" per acre of such improved land shall be made by the village board. 
2.  Annual review of fair market value. The village shall review, on or before December 31 of each year, the fair market value of improved land in and around the village. Based on this review, the village shall revise the fair market value set forth in subsection (a)(7)c.1., supra, as necessary. 
3.  Cash contribution; requirement. The cash contribution as provided for in this section is a requirement of this chapter. The contribution will be payable at the time of application for a building permit on each lot or such other time as required by the village board. The amount due will be calculated based upon the residence to which the application for a building permit applies in accordance with subsection (a)(2)a. of this section. 
4.  Cash contribution; collection. Cash contributions as prescribed herein to the park district, forest preserve district, fire protection district, or library district shall be collected by the designated agency and accounted for on a subdivision by subdivision basis. 
5.  Fund report. The park district, forest preserve district, fire protection district, and/or library district shall submit, on an annual basis, a report in a form and level of detail acceptable to the village board, detailing the collection of funds on a subdivision by subdivision basis and certifying that the expenditure of such funds collected under this section 78-72(a)(7) has been and will be as prescribed by law. 
d.  Criteria for requiring both land and cash dedication. In some situations, the village board may determine that a combination of land dedication and cash contribution is appropriate. In such situations, the village board may, with or without the recommendations of the park district board, forest preserve district board, fire protection district board, or library district board, require the subdivider or developer to provide any combination of land dedication and cash contribution so long as the total does not exceed the maximum required dedication prescribed in this section. 
Situations in which such a combination of dedication and contribution may be appropriate include, but are not limited to, where only a portion of the land proposed as the location for a land site and/or open space contribution is part of the subdivision or planned unit development seeking a final plat. In such a situation, the village board may require the subdivider or developer to dedicate that portion of the land site that is within the subdivision or planned unit development and then make a cash contribution equal to the difference between the actual acreage dedicated and the requirements under this section. 
e.  Taxing district board recommendations. 
1.  All recommendations, reports and supporting information required or permitted by this section shall be submitted to the village board in writing with all necessary exhibits. The receiving agency shall provide written notice of their recommendation to the village board at least ten business days in advance of the anticipated date of any annexation agreement and/or final plat approval by the village. 
2.  The recommendations of each taxing body shall be advisory only, and in no way binding upon the village board. 
3.  If the taxing district board's recommendation includes the acceptance of a park site, the park type, as described in the park district's park district master plan, as amended, shall be identified in the written correspondence to the village board. 
If the taxing district board's recommendation includes the acceptance of cash in-lieu-of land dedications, the taxing district shall also submit a signed certificate stating that all funds collected pursuant to subsection 78-72(a)(7) will serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision from which the funds will be collected and that such funds will be expended in a manner prescribed by law. 
(8)  Other fees required. In addition to the land and/or cash contributions-in-lieu of land dedications required under subsections 78-72(a)(2) and 78-72(a)(7), supra, each subdivider or developer of a final plat of subdivision or planned unit development shall be required to make the following contributions to the village: 
a.  Municipal building fee of $851.00 per dwelling unit; and 
b.  Transportation fee of $1,019.00 per dwelling unit. 
c.  The contributions required above shall be payable at the time of application for a building permit on each lot or such other time as required by the village board. 
d.  Annual review-other fees. The village shall review, on or before December 31 of each year, the municipal building fee and transportation fee. Based on this review, the village shall revise the amounts of these fees, if necessary.

Secs. 78-76-78-100. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 78-101. - Street plan. 
    The subdivision of land, including the arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets, alleys or other lands to be dedicated for public use, shall conform to the general development plan of the village as approved and adopted by the village board and other responsible governmental bodies, if any; and streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets, and shall be curvilineal, except for primary streets. 
(Code 1981, § 11-5-1) 
Sec. 78-102. - Right-of-way widths; street design standards. 
(a)  Minimum right-of-way widths. The minimum widths of rights-of-way for streets to be dedicated or established after the effective date hereof within the village or the environs under jurisdiction of this chapter shall conform to the following schedule: 
Primary streets, major streets and parkways 100 feet (located in accordance with master street plan) Secondary or collector streets or industrial streets  80 feet Minor streets  66 feet Culs-de-sac  75 feet Crosswalkways  10 feet Utility easements  20 feet (10 feet on each side of lot line)  
(b)  Right-of-way width for multifamily developments. The minimum widths of rights-of-way for multifamily developments shall be 72 feet. 
(c)  Right-of-way width for single-family developments. The minimum widths of rights-of-way for minor streets in single-family developments shall be 66 feet. 
(d)  Width of street pavement; roadways or rights-of-way under jurisdiction of agency other than village. 
(1)  Minimum pavement widths. With the exception of frontage roads and marginal access streets, no pavement less than 28 feet wide as measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement as indicated on figure 11-5 will be allowed as part of the public improvements indicated in this chapter. 
(2)  Half streets constructed adjacent to existing roadway. Where a half street is proposed adjacent to or on any part of an existing roadway and where jurisdiction of the roadway is or will be transferred to the village as part of the development process, at least one-half of the pavement widths indicated on Standard Detail 16A, 16B, 16C or 16D must be new construction. The existing roadway surface may be combined with the new construction to obtain the 28-foot requirement as indicated on figure 11-5 with the approval of the village engineer. 
(3)  Roadways or rights-of-way under jurisdiction of agency other than village. Where a development abuts a roadway or right-of-way under the jurisdiction of any agency other than the village, and where the jurisdiction will remain with such agency following the development, roadway construction and/or improvements shall be done in accordance with the requirements of that agency. 
(e)  Design of minor streets; location of driveways on through lots. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Where a marginal or access street is used as a minor street in a residential subdivision with the lot having frontage on both the minor street and the primary, major, secondary or collector street, the covenants for the subdivision shall prohibit the installation of driveways along the property line of the lot which forms the line of a primary, major, secondary or collector street. 
(f)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided. 
(g)  Visibility distance. Clear visibility, measured along the centerline of the street, shall be provided for at least 300 feet on all primary streets, at least 200 feet on secondary streets, and at least 100 feet on all other streets. 
(h)  Design of intersections. It must be evidenced that all street intersections and confluences encourage safe traffic flow. 
(i)  Alleys. 
(1)  Alleys shall be required in commercial and industrial districts. The plan commission shall refer any variations to the board of trustees for waiving this requirement if provisions are made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
(2)  Alleys shall be prohibited in residential areas, except where topographic or other conditions may necessitate their use. 
(3)  The width of an alley shall not be less than 20 feet or more than 40 feet. 
(j)  Culs-de-sac. The length of a street terminating in a cul-de-sac shall be measured along the centerline of the road from the center of the circle to the near right-of-way of the intersecting street and shall not exceed 500 feet for subdivisions with lots having less than 15,000 square feet, or 900 feet for subdivisions with lots having at least 15,000 square feet and no more than 35,000 square feet, and in no case shall the length exceed 1,200 feet. Where there is a probability of extending a street beyond the present subdivision, a "T" turnaround should be considered, 20 feet wide by 30 feet in length, on both sides of the street right-of-way. Driveways shall not be constructed on "T" turnarounds. 
(k)  Half streets; reserve strips. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of this chapter, and where the plan commission and board of trustees find it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be placed within such tract. No strip or area shall be reserved along any portion of a street, half street or alley which will prevent adjacent property owners access thereto, except by consent of the village board. 
(l)  Street names. Street names which are not approved by the plan commission, or which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets in the New Lenox, Joliet and Mokena postal delivering districts, shall not be used. Existing street names must be projected wherever possible. 
(m)  Subdivisions bordering on or containing major streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed major street, the plan commission and board of trustees may require a marginal access street or reversed frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation, which shall have a minimum width of ten feet along the rear property line, or other treatment as may be adequate for protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(n)  Entrances from highways under state jurisdiction. If the tract of land proposed to be subdivided or any part thereof lies adjacent to a highway over which the department of transportation of the state has jurisdiction with respect to maintenance and upkeep thereof, and an entrance is desired from such highway to lots, streets, roadways or alleys in such proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall submit to the plan commission of the village a written permit from the department of transportation granting its permission to obtain and construct such an entrance. 
(o)  Curves. 
(1)  Roads shall be designed so that all deflections in horizontal alignment will be accomplished through segments of circular curves properly incorporated into the design. The minimum permitted centerline radii shall be as follows: 
a.  Primary or secondary streets: 450 feet. 
b.  Minor (residential) streets: 250 feet. 
c.  All other streets: 150 feet. 
(2)  A tangent of at least 100 feet shall be introduced between two curves either one of which has a radius of 250 feet or less.

Editor's note- Figure 11-5, referred to in the preceding section, is not printed herein, but is on file in the village offices. 
Sec. 78-103. - Easements. 
    Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities, street lighting and drainage, where necessary, and shall be at least 20 feet wide (ten feet on each side of the lot line). The easement shall be so laid out that a proper continuity may be had from lot to lot and from block to block. In addition, due provisions for extension of easements to adjacent areas shall be made. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and of such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose and approved by the village engineer. 
(Code 1981, § 11-5-3) 
Sec. 78-104. - Residential blocks. 
    Standards for residential blocks are as follows: 
(1)  Length; crosswalks. The maximum length of blocks permitted is 1,800 feet. Blocks over 800 feet may require crosswalk easements. Crosswalk easements not less than ten feet in width shall be provided where deemed necessary by the plan commission at the approximate centers of the blocks. The use of additional crosswalkways in any instance to provide safe and convenient access to schools, parks or other similar destinations may be recommended by the plan commission. 
(2)  Shape. No specific rule concerning the shape of blocks is made, but blocks must fit easily into the overall plan of the village and their design must evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic flow and public areas. 
(Code 1981, § 11-5-4) 
Sec. 78-105. - Residential lots. 
    Standards for residential lots are as follows: 
(1)  All side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines, or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation to this rule will give a better street and lot plan. Lots with double frontage shall be avoided. All residential lots shall abut on a publicly dedicated street. 
(2)  The minimum area of lots resulting from the subdivision of tracts within the village after the effective date of Ordinance No. 708 shall be 9,375 square feet, and lots shall have a minimum of 75 feet frontage at the required building line, except as otherwise provided in the zoning provisions of this Code (chapter 106). 
(3)  Except as provided in section 78-7, the minimum width of residential lots at the building line shall be as follows, provided the original frontage of the land to be subdivided is 150 feet or more: 
a.  All lots containing an area of 12,500 square feet or more, but less than 15,000 square feet, shall have a minimum frontage of 75 feet. 
b.  All lots containing an area of 15,000 square feet or more, but less than 20,000 square feet, shall have a minimum frontage of 90 feet. 
c.  All lots containing an area of 20,000 square feet or more, but less than 30,000 square feet, shall have a minimum frontage of 100 feet. 
d.  All lots containing an area of 30,000 square feet or more, but less than one acre, shall have a minimum frontage of 125 feet. 
e.  All lots containing an area of one acre, but not more than five acres, shall have a minimum frontage of 150 feet or a frontage equal to 40 percent of the lot depth, whichever is greater. 
(4)  Where the lots front upon a cul-de-sac or curved road or street having a radius of 200 feet or less, the minimum width of the frontage at the lot may be measured at the building line, with the width at the right-of-way line to be not less than 54 feet, with such width being measured on the arc of the street right-of-way line. 
(5)  The area of the street right-of-way, whether dedicated to the public or a private street or easement for street purposes, shall not be included in calculating the area of the lot to be in accordance with the minimum lot area requirements of the zoning district in which the lot is located. Lots with an area larger than the minimum requirements are desirable. The lot shall also have a width and a depth entirely adequate to provide the necessary yard requirements of the zoning regulations of this Code (chapter 106). 
(6)  Where corner lots back upon lots facing the side street, the corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the establishment of front building lines on both the front and the side of the lots adjoining the streets. Extra widths shall be provided on all corner lots irrespective of whether they rear upon lots facing the side streets. 
(7)  Lots upon major highway intersections and at all other acute angle intersections which, in the opinion of the plan commission, are likely to be dangerous to traffic movement, shall have a radius of 25 feet at the street corner. On business lots, a chord may be substituted, with the approval of the commission, for the circular arc. Where grade separation structures are proposed at the intersection of major highways, the lots and improvements in the subdivision shall be arranged so as to make adequate provision for such structures. 
(8)  Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream shall have additional minimum width or depth as required to provide an adequate building site and afford the minimum usable area required in the zoning regulations of the village (chapter 106) for front, rear and side yards. 
(Code 1981, § 11-5-5) 
Sec. 78-106. - Subdivisions in commercial districts. 
    The minimum standards for design and improvement of subdivisions developed in areas zoned for commercial use after the effective date of Ordinance No. 708 shall be in accordance with the requirements for planned commercial districts as stipulated in chapter 106, article III, division 4. These standards shall apply regardless of whether the subdivision is platted for sale in lots, tracts or parcels or is planned to be held in one ownership and leased. 
(Code 1981, § 11-5-6) 
Sec. 78-107. - Subdivisions in industrial districts. 
    The minimum standards for design and improvement of subdivisions developed in areas zoned for industrial use after the effective date of Ordinance No. 708 shall be in accordance with the requirements for planned industrial districts as stipulated in chapter 106, article III, division 5. These standards shall apply regardless of whether the subdivision is platted for sale in lots, tracts or parcels, or is planned to be held in one ownership and leased. 
(Code 1981, § 11-5-7) 
Sec. 78-108. - Building lines. 
(a)  Minimum building lines shall be shown on plats of subdivisions within the incorporated area of the village which are intended for residential use of any character, and on commercial or industrial lots immediately adjoining such residential areas. Such building lines on lots adjacent to major highways shall not be less than the building and setback lines established by any ordinance of the village board. In all cases, building lines shall not be less than required by any zoning regulation applying to the property. Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control, the subdivider shall establish building lines in accordance with the needs of each addition, but in no case shall such building lines be less than 30 feet from the right-of-way of the street or highway upon which the lot fronts, except, where all frontage on one side of the street between two intersecting streets is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes, the minimum building lines shall not be less than 30 feet from the right-of-way lines of the streets adjoining the commercial or industrial area. 
(b)  Restrictions requiring buildings to be set back to such building lines shall either be shown on the plat or shall be contained in a separately recorded instrument and referred to in the plat. 
(c)  Building lines for territory outside the incorporated limits but within the jurisdiction of this chapter shall conform to the provisions of this chapter, except that in no instance shall the building line be less than 30 feet from the street right-of-way line. 
(Code 1981, § 11-5-8)

The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: (1) the estimated number of children to be served in each such school classification to (2) the maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification, as stated in this article, and then applying such ratio to the minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated in this article. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification. 
_____
(b)  School classifications and minimum size of sites. School classifications and the size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
School Classification by Grades Maximum Number of Students for Each Such School Classification Minimum Number of Acres of Land For Each School Site of Such Classification Elementary schools, grades kindergarten through 5 600 students 11 acres Junior high schools, grades 6 through 8 900 students 19 acres High schools, grades 9 through 12 2,500 students 50 acres  
(c)  Location of sites. The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall, to the extent practicable, be used as a guideline in locating school sites.

Sec. 78-173. - Criteria for cash contribution in lieu of dedication. 
(a)  Authority to require cash contribution in lieu of dedication; use of funds. Where the development is small and the resulting school site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, the village shall require the builder to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall, at the time of issuance of building permits, be paid to the appropriate school districts for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for the improvement of any existing school site which already serves or will serve such needs, or for the construction of any school buildings or additions thereto, or for the retirement of any bonds issued for school construction or improvements. 
(b)  Amount of contribution. 
(1)  Fair market value. The amount of cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the improved fair market value of land in the proposed subdivision or planned unit development. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value set forth in section 78-72(a)(7)c., supra, that otherwise would have been dedicated unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection, the subdivider or developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of the subdivision or planned unit development, or other evidence thereof, and final determination of the fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the village board. 
(c)  Criteria for requiring both dedication and cash contribution. Situations may arise where a combination of land dedication and a cash contribution in lieu of land are both necessary and appropriate. These occasions generally arise when: 
(1)  Portion of land. Only a portion of the land proposed as the location for a school site lies within the subdivision or planned unit development. In such a situation, the subdivider or developer shall dedicate such portion of the land within the subdivision or planned unit development that falls within the proposed school site location as provided in this section and then make a cash contribution in lieu of further dedication in an amount equal to the difference between the required land area dedication pursuant to this section and the land area actually dedicated. 
(2)  Majority of land. A major part of the school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. In such a situation, the subdivider or developer shall dedicate only the remaining portions of land required for the school site and then make a cash contribution in lieu of further dedication. Such contribution in lieu of dedication shall be in an amount equal to the difference between the required land area dedication pursuant to this section and the land area actually dedicated.

(b)  Objections; review and amendment of standards. If a subdivider or developer of a planned unit development files a written objection to the table of estimated student population in this section, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development, and in that event final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer of the planned unit development and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the school districts or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution, and local conditions change over the years and that the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated in this article, is subject to periodic review and amendment, if necessary.

(b)  Should a land dedication include a detention/retention area over and above the required minimum acres required under this article, said land may be accepted. No bogs or swamps shall be acceptable as required land dedications. Lakes and native prairie wetlands shall not normally be acceptable, but may be approved where the area offers an exceptional amenity or the chance to protect a significant natural resource. Sites that have been part of an unlicensed landfill or a toxic waste dump shall not be acceptable as required land dedications. 
(c)  Every effort shall be made to conserve for public use and enjoyment those areas of significant natural and environmental value.

Sec. 90-93. - Duty of drivers to decrease speed under certain conditions.

DIVISION 4. - AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM 

Sec. 90-131. - General. 
    The village hereby adopts an automated traffic law enforcement system for the purpose of using photographic, video, or digital imaging equipment to record visual images of vehicles entering intersections in violation of section 90-70 of the Village Code of Ordinances, and using said images as the basis for issuing a "violation notice" to the owners of such vehicles. An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system shall be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement system. 
(Ord. No. 1859, § 24, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 90-132. - Enforcement. 
    When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor vehicle entering an intersection in violation of section 90-70 of the Code of Ordinances, the recorded image of the violation associated with an automated traffic law violation shall first be reviewed and inspected by a technician employed or contracted by the village, who shall determine: 
(1)  Whether the motor vehicle violated section 90-70 of the Code of Ordinances; and 
(2)  Whether one of the following defenses applies: 
a.  The vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral procession or 
b.  The vehicle entered the intersection in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle. 
    Upon determination that the recorded image captures a violation and that no defense applies, the village shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by first class mail within 30 days after the Illinois secretary of state notifies the village of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days following the violation. 
(Ord. No. 1859, § 24, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 90-133. - Defenses. 
    A hearing officer may consider, in defense to a violation under section 90-70 of the Code of Ordinances, the following: 
(1)  The motor vehicle or registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation, which may be demonstrated through the submission of proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. 
(2)  The driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection in spite of a red light either to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or as part of a funeral procession. 
(3)  The motor vehicle was being operated by someone other than the registered vehicle owner or lessee at the time of the violation, which shall require written notification to the village and shall only be deemed a valid defense insofar as the registered vehicle owner provides the name and address of the person operating the vehicle at the time of the alleged offense. Failure to notify the village in writing of the name and address of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged offense in advance of the hearing date or date on which the civil penalty is due will result in a presumption that the registered owner or lessee was the operator of the vehicle at the time of the offense and will result in a finding of liability unless one of the other defenses is applicable and duly established. 
(Ord. No. 1859, § 23, 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 90-134. - Administrative adjudication. 
    All automated traffic law enforcement violations are civil in nature and shall be adjudicated through the village's administrative adjudication of municipal code violations.

Sec. 106-9. - Scope of chapter. 
    It is hereby declared that the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all properties as specifically provided in this section: 
(1)  New uses. No building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, moved or structurally altered, and no building, structure or land shall hereafter be used, occupied or arranged or designed for use or occupancy, nor shall any excavating or grading be commenced in connection with any of such matters, except as permitted by the regulations of this chapter for the zoning district in which such building, structure or land is located. 
(2)  Existing uses. Except as may otherwise be provided, all structural alterations or relocation of existing buildings occurring hereafter, and all enlargements of or additions to existing uses occurring hereafter, shall be subject to all regulations in this chapter which are applicable to the zoning districts in which such buildings, uses or land shall be located. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses. Any lawful building, structure or use existing at the time of the effective date hereof may be continued, even though such building, structure or use does not conform to the provisions in this chapter for the district in which it is located, and whenever a district shall be changed hereafter, the then-existing lawful use may be continued, subject to the provisions in article V of this chapter. 
(4)  Existing special uses. Where a structure and use thereof of land lawfully exists on the effective date hereof, and is classified by this chapter as a special use in the district where it is located, such use shall be considered a lawful special use. A special use permit issued in accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter shall be required only for any expansion or major alteration of such existing legal special use. 
(5)  Lots of record not meeting dimensional standards. A lot of record at the time of the effective date hereof, in a residence district, which is unable to meet the requirements of this chapter as to area, lot width and yard requirements, may be used for a single-family detached dwelling, provided it shall meet all the other requirements of this chapter. 
(6)  Contiguous parcels not meeting dimensional standards. When two or more parcels of land, each of which lacks adequate area and dimension to qualify for a permitted use under the requirements of the use district in which they are located, are contiguous and are held in one ownership at the time of or subsequent to the effective date hereof or amendment hereto, they shall be used as one zoning lot for such use. 
(7)  Existing building permits. Where a building permit for a building or structure has been issued in accordance with law prior to the effective date hereof, and provided that construction is begun within 90 days of such effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion, the building or structure may be completed in accordance with the approved plans on the basis of which the building permit was issued, and further may upon completion be occupied under a certificate of occupancy for the use for which originally designated, subject thereafter to the provisions of article V of this chapter. Article V of this chapter shall also control building permits lawfully issued prior to future amendments to this chapter. 
(8)  Existing donation drop boxes. Certain donation drop boxes are known to exist within the corporate limits of the village and may or may not conform to the requirements of this chapter. The operators of said non-conforming donation drop boxes shall have 90 days from the effective date of Ordinance No. 2647 to obtain the required permits as set forth in this chapter or to remove said donation drop boxes.

Sec. 106-10. - Lots generally. 
(a)  Number of principal buildings on lot. Except in the case of a planned development, not more than one principal detached single-family residential building shall be located on a residential lot, nor shall a principal detached single-family residential building be located on the same zoning lot with any other principal building. 
(b)  Division of lots. No lot shall hereafter be divided into two or more lots for the purpose of transfer of ownership unless all lots resulting from each such division shall conform with all the applicable regulations required by this chapter. 
(c)  Through lots. On vacant through lots, the front lot lines shall be along the street right-of-way designated by the building commissioner, except that when a front lot line has been established on one or more lots in the same block and all have front lot lines established along the same street right-of-way line, the street right-of-way line designated as the front lot line for such lots shall be the front line on all vacant through lots in such block. Only such obstructions as permitted in this chapter in front yards shall be located in that part of a rear yard adjoining a street that is equivalent in depth to a required front yard, except for lots backing to thoroughfares in subdivisions where no-access strips have been provided on the recorded plats. 
(d)  Corner lots. On a corner lot, the front lot line shall be the lot line having the shortest dimension along the street right-of-way line. The required front yard setback on corner lots shall apply to each side of the lot facing a street.

(f)  Lots without street frontage. Every structure or group of structures, and every use or group of uses, shall be located upon a lot. Where unique land planning designs are employed in a subdivision or planned development to conserve the natural character of the land or to create a functional or compatible arrangement of structures or uses, a lot which does not abut upon a public or private street may be permitted, provided that: 
(1)  Adequate provision is made for free access to the lot for the property owner, or, in the case of a nonresidential lot, for those persons who would normally require access to the lot. 
(2)  Adequate provision is made for the unobstructed access of firefighting services, police protection, mail-carrier letter service, rubbish collection and other governmental services. 
(3)  Adequate provision is made for the extension and maintenance of public and private utility services.

(Code 1981, § 10-7-4) 
Sec. 106-11. - Open space on lots. 
    The following general provisions dealing with open spaces, lot coverage, yards, setbacks, vision clearance and permitted obstructions are established: 
(1)  Maintenance of open spaces. The maintenance of yards, courts and other open spaces and the minimum lot area legally required for a building shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such building or of the property on which it is located, as long as the building is in existence. Furthermore, no legally required yards, courts or other open space, or minimum lot area allocated to any building, shall by virtue of change of ownership or for any other reason be used to satisfy yard, court, other open space or minimum lot area requirements for any other building. 
(2)  Location of open spaces. All yards, courts and other open space allocated to a building or group of buildings shall be located on the same zoning lots as such building or group of buildings. 
(3)  Reduction of yards. No yards now or hereafter provided for a building existing on the effective date hereof shall subsequently be reduced below, if already less than, the minimum yard requirements of this chapter for equivalent new construction. However, a yard adjoining a street may be reduced to provide right-of-way for a street widening. 
(4)  Required setbacks. Minimum setbacks on lots abutting a street or thoroughfare shall be the distance required for a front yard or side yard adjoining a street, in the districts where such lots are located, measured from the existing right-of-way line of the street or thoroughfare, or from the proposed right-of-way line as designated on the official map, and as duly established by other ordinances or as established by county or state highway authorities, whichever has the greater right-of-way width requirements. 
(5)  Exceptions for established setbacks. 
a.  Established setback greater than required setback. Where 50 percent or more of the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have observed (within a variation of five feet or less), a front yard greater in depth than required in this chapter, new buildings shall not be erected closer to the street than the average front yard so established by the existing buildings. 
b.  Established setback less than required setback. Where 50 percent or more of the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have not observed a front yard as required in this chapter, then: 
1.  Interior lots. For interior lots: 
i.  Where a building is to be erected within 100 feet of existing buildings on both sides, the minimum front yard shall be a line drawn between the closest front corners of the two existing buildings. 
ii.  Where a building is to be erected within 100 feet of an existing building on one side only, it may be erected as close to the street as the existing building. 
2.  Corner lots. For corner lots, the depth of the setback lines shall be as normally required in the district where the lot is located. 
(6)  Vision clearance on corner lots. On corner lots, no structures or plant materials shall obstruct a clear path of motor vehicle drivers' vision of approaching vehicles within 25 feet of the street intersections. In any business district the distance may be reduced to ten feet and shall not apply to that part of a building above the first floor. 
(7)  Permitted obstructions in required yards. The following shall not be considered to be obstructions when located in the required yards specified: 
a.  All yards. In all yards: 
1.  Open terraces not over four feet above the average level of the adjoining ground, but not including a permanently roofed-over terrace or porch. 
2.  Awnings and canopies, but not projecting more than ten feet, and at least seven feet above the average level of the adjoining ground.

5.  Arbors, trellises, flagpoles, fountains, sculptures, plant boxes and other similar ornamental objects. 
6.  Fences and walls not exceeding three feet in height above the natural grade level in front yards and not exceeding six feet in height above natural grade level in side and rear yards. For corner lots, fences and walls in corner side yards shall not exceed four feet in height above the natural grade level, provided that no fence exceeding a height of two feet shall be permitted within ten feet of any right-of-way line for a distance of forty feet from the intersection of any two right-of-way lines or from the intersection of any right-of-way line and any driveway. All supporting posts shall be exposed to the lot interior and shall not face the adjoining properties. 
7.  No barbed wire or barbed wire fences shall be allowed on private property in residential zones, or on lots in any zoning district being used for single- or multiple-family dwelling purposes. No fences shall be constructed of material obviously intended to inflict great bodily harm should a person attempt to climb or scale it. Such material shall include but not be limited to electrically charged wire or other electrical conduit, broken glass, razor blades and sharp or jagged metal spikes or spears. Barbed or electrically charged fences may be used only as authorized by the special provisions of the particular zoning district in which the fence is intended. Commercial and industrial zoned districts are permitted an eight-foot chainlink fence with a barbed wire security fence installed on top of the chainlink fence. Total height for this type of fencing shall not exceed ten feet. The entire fence, including projections, must be completely located within the property on which it is installed. 
b.  Front yards. In front yards, one-story bay windows projecting three feet or less into the yard, and overhanging eaves and gutters projecting three feet or less into the yard. 
c.  Rear yards. In rear yards, enclosed, attached or detached off-street parking spaces, accessory sheds, tool rooms and similar buildings or structures for domestic or agricultural storage; balconies, breezeways and open porches; one-story bay windows projecting three feet or less into the yard; and overhanging eaves and gutters projecting three feet or less into the yard. In any residential district, no accessory building shall be nearer than five feet to the rear lot line or nearer than ten feet to any principal building unattached. 
d.  Side yards. In side yards, overhanging eaves and gutters projecting into the yard for a distance not exceeding 40 percent of the required yard width, but in no case exceeding two feet.

(a)  Authority of board of appeals. In specific cases in which there are practical difficulties or particular hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this chapter, the zoning board of appeals shall have the power and duty to determine and vary the application of such regulations, in harmony with their general purpose and intent, but only in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section. 
(b)  Application; notice of hearing. 
(1)  An application for a variation shall be filed in duplicate with the village clerk, who shall forward a copy of the application to the board without delay. The application shall be in such form, contain such information, and be accompanied by such plans as the board may by rule require. The board shall hold a public hearing on such application not more than 60 days after its filing. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing shall be published at least once, not more than 30 days and not less than 15 days before the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the village. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as the board may provide by rule. 
(2)  Signs. In addition, at least 15 days prior to such public hearing, notice thereof shall be posted on the road or street frontage (or if there is no road frontage, at a location determined by the planning and development administrator) of the land being the subject matter of the application for a variation. 
a.  Number. One sign shall be required for every 500 feet of frontage or fraction thereof. On corner lots two signs, one facing each street, shall be required. For corner lots, the number of signs facing each street shall be calculated individually based on the frontage of each street. Notwithstanding the total frontage of the property, no more than two signs shall be required per street frontage. 
b.  Size. 
1.  For variances for residential properties, the sign shall be approximately 18 inches by 24 inches in size, and shall be mounted at least three feet off the ground. The village planning department shall provide the sign blanks and sign support system that must be used by the petitioner. The petitioner shall be required to post a $50.00 cash bond for sign supports at the time of installation. The deposit shall be refunded to the petitioner when the sign is returned to the planning department. The sign shall bear the following: 
a.  Zoning hearing. 
b.  The action proposed. 
c.  New Lenox Village Hall, date and time. 
The applicant shall remove all signs within 48 hours of the board of appeals recommendation to the village board. The petitioner shall submit to the board of appeals, before the public hearing, an affidavit stating that all signs were posted in accordance with this subsection (b)(2). 
2.  For variances for commercial or industrial properties, the sign shall be approximately four feet by four feet in size. The village planning department shall cause the sign to be installed on the subject property. The sign shall bear the following:

b.  The action proposed. 
c.  New Lenox Village Hall, date and time. 
(3)  The applicant shall notify all owners of property within 250 feet of the property in question of the public hearing to be conducted by the board of appeals. Such notification shall contain a copy of the application of the petitioner and the time, date and place of the public hearing. Such notice shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, and delivery made at least ten days prior to the hearing. The applicant shall provide the chairman of the board of appeals an affidavit prior to the public hearing attesting that notice has been made, and attach a copy of the notice and the return receipts. 
(4)  In the event a variation request, for which the public hearing has already been held in accordance with section 106-46(b)(1), has not reached final disposition and is not discussed during a regular meeting of the village board or plan commission for a period of six months, it shall not be placed on a future village board or plan commission meeting agenda until notification of property owners as required by section 106-46(b)(3) is again provided. 
(c)  Standards; required findings. 
(1)  The zoning board of appeals shall not vary the provisions of this chapter as authorized in this section unless it shall have made findings based upon the evidence presented to it in the following cases: 
a.  That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations governing the district in which it is located; 
b.  That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; or 
c.  That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
(2)  A variation shall be permitted only if the evidence, in the judgment of the board of appeals, sustains each of the three conditions enumerated in subsection (c)(1) of this section. 
(3)  For the purpose of supplementing the standards in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the zoning board of appeals, in making this determination whenever there are practical difficulties or particular hardship, shall also take into consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the evidence: 
a.  That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved will bring a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out; 
b.  That the conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning classification; 
c.  That the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property; 
d.  That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property; 
e.  That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or unduly injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; or 
f.  That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
(4)  The zoning board of appeals may require such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this section, to reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to implement the general purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(d)  Authorized variations. Variations from the regulations of this chapter shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals only in accordance with the standards set out in this section, and may be granted only in the following instances, and in no others: 
(1)  To permit any variance of not more than 25 percent of any site and structure requirements by the applicable zoning district regulations. 
(2)  To permit the use of a lot of record on the effective date hereof for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot, but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot be less than 90 percent of the required area and width. 
(3)  To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as required facilities for two or more uses, provided that substantial use of such facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same days of the week. 
(4)  To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by 20 percent of the applicable regulations. 
(5)  To increase by not more than 25 percent the maximum distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served. 
(6)  To increase by not more than 20 percent the gross area of a sign. 
(7)  To increase by not more than one foot the maximum allowable height of a fence. 
(e)  Other variations: With the exception of waivers to the Sign Code for temporary signs, variations to Title 10 other than those listed above may be granted by the village board, but only after a public hearing as set forth herein for an authorized variation, and a report of findings from the zoning board of appeals. 
(f)  Expiration; abandonment of use. No order of the board granting a variation shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date of such order unless a building permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within such period. The board may grant one extension of this period, valid for no more than 180 additional days, upon written application, and good cause shown, without notice or hearing. If any of the benefits conferred by any variation, whether heretofore or hereafter granted, are abandoned, or are not utilized for any continuous period of one year, the variation shall, to the extent of such abandonment or nonutilization, become void. 
(g)  Decisions. Not more than 60 days after the close of the public hearing, the board shall make its findings of fact and its determination, in writing, and shall forthwith transmit a copy thereof to the applicant. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to grant a variation.

(b)  Right of appeal; filing of notice of appeal. An appeal in which it is alleged that there is error in any decision made by the building commissioner under this chapter may be taken to the board by any person or governmental agency aggrieved by such decision or by any department, officer, board or bureau of the village. Such an appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the board by rule, but no longer than 45 days, by filing with the village clerk a notice of appeal in such form as the board may provide by rule. The building commissioner shall, without delay, forward to the board a copy of the notice of appeal, together with all of the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. 
(c)  Stay of proceedings pending appeal. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the decision appealed unless the building commissioner certifies to the board, after the notice of the appeal has been filed with him, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed unless by a restraining order, which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the building commissioner and on due cause shown. 
(d)  Notice of hearing. The board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give notice thereof to the parties, including the appellant, the building commissioner and any other affected party who has requested in writing that he be so notified.

(Code 1981, § 10-12-7) 
Sec. 106-48. - Special use permits. 
(a)  Purpose; applicability. This chapter is based upon the division of the village into districts, within which the uses of land and the use and bulk of buildings and structures are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, can only be properly classified in any particular district upon consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two categories: 
(1)  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest; and 
(2)  Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property, public facilities or the village as a whole. 
(b)  Authority of village board. Special use permits may be granted by the village board, but only in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section. 
(c)  Application; notice of hearing. 
(1)  An application for a special use permit shall be filed in duplicate with the village clerk, who shall forward a copy of the application to the plan commission without delay. The application shall be in such form, contain such information, and be accompanied by such plans as the plan commission may by rule require. The plan commission shall hold a public hearing on such application not more than 60 days after its filing. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing shall be published at least once, not more than 30 days and not less than 15 days before the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the village. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as the commission may provide by rule. 
(2)  Signs. In addition, at least 15 days prior to such public hearing, notice thereof shall be posted on the road or street frontage (or if there is no road frontage, at a location determined by the planning and development administrator) of the land being the subject matter of the application for a special use permit. 
a.  Number. One sign shall be required for every 500 feet of frontage or fraction thereof. On corner lots two signs, one facing each street, shall be required. For corner lots, the number of signs facing each street shall be calculated individually based on the frontage of each street. Notwithstanding the total frontage of the property, no more than two signs shall be required per street frontage. 
b.  Size. 
1.  For properties less than ten acres in size, the sign shall be approximately four feet by four feet in size. The village planning department shall cause the sign to be installed on the subject property. The sign shall bear the following: 
a.  Zoning hearing. 
b.  The action proposed. 
c.  New Lenox Village Hall, date and time. 
2.  For properties ten acres or greater in size, the sign shall be approximately four feet by eight feet in size. The village planning department shall cause the sign to be installed on the subject property. The sign shall bear the following:

Such notification shall contain a copy of the application of the petitioner and the time, date and place of the public hearing. Such notice shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, and delivery made at least ten days prior to the hearing. The applicant shall provide the chairman of the plan commission an affidavit prior to the public hearing attesting that notice has been made, and attach a copy of the notice and the return receipts. 
(4)  In the event a special use permit request, for which the public hearing has already been held in accordance with Section 106-48(c)(1), has not reached final disposition and is not discussed during a regular meeting of the village board or plan commission for a period of six months, it shall not be placed on a future village board or plan commission meeting agenda until notification of property owners as required by section 106-48(c)(3) is again provided. 
(d)  Report and recommendation by plan commission. Within 60 days after the close of the hearing, unless the applicant shall have consented to a longer period, the commission shall transmit to the village board a written report giving its findings and recommendations for action to be taken by the village board on the application. The report shall include any recommended conditions or restrictions to be imposed upon the premises benefited by the special use permit. 
(e)  Standards for specific uses. A special use permit for the uses listed in section 106-132(c)(2) may be granted and the applicable district regulations modified only if evidence is presented to establish that: 
(1)  The proposed building or use at the particular location requested is necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility which is in the interest of the public convenience and will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood or community; 
(2)  The proposed building or use will not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, utility facilities and other matters affecting the public health, safety and general welfare;

(6)  Provisions for financial institutions. In addition to the other standards set forth in this section, a special use permit for a financial institution shall be granted only if evidence is presented to establish that: 
a.  The village will derive benefit through the granting of a special use permit for the proposed financial institution; and, 
b.  If the proposed financial institution is part of a larger shopping center, the proportion of the square footage of the shopping center devoted to the financial institution and the location of the financial institution within the shopping center is in the public interest. 
(7)  Provisions for outdoor areas for dining and drinking establishments. In addition to the other standards set forth in this section, in granting a special use for outdoor areas for dining and drinking establishments, the plan commission and village board shall consider the following:

The village board may grant one extension of this period, valid for no more than 180 days, upon written application and good cause shown, without notice or hearing. If any special use is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, the special use permit for such use shall become void, and such use shall not thereafter be reestablished unless a new special use permit is obtained. 
(g)  Decision by village board. The village board, upon report of the plan commission and without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed special use in accordance with applicable statutes of the state, or may refer it back to the plan commission for further consideration. 
(h)  Planned unit developments. A planned unit development shall be granted a special use permit. The standards, requirements and procedures granted shall be in accordance with article VII of this chapter.

Cross reference- Construction regulations for commercial and industrial districts, § 18-171 et seq.; businesses, ch. 22. 

Sec. 106-181. - Purpose. 
    The industrial district regulations are intended to govern the location, intensity and method of development of the industrial areas of the village. The regulations are designed to provide for the grouping together of industries that are compatible with one another and that are not objectionable to the community as a whole. The I-1 limited industrial district is intended to provide an environment suitable for industrial activities that do not create appreciable nuisances or hazards. The regulations preserve lands for industrial and allied uses and prohibit the intrusion of residential and other noncompatible uses into the industrial area. The performance of the industrial uses is regulated by establishing standards for the external effects of noise, smoke, vibration and other potential nuisances. The limited industrial district is intended to contain uses such as wholesaling, warehousing and limited manufacturing activities.

ARTICLE VII. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1571, § 1, adopted Aug. 10, 2004, amended art VII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, said article pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis of repeal and inclusion. 

Sec. 106-351. - Intent and purpose. 
    A planned unit development (PUD) is intended to provide a means by which land can be developed or redeveloped with an emphasis on innovation, creativity and design. The planned unit development is intended to provide for developments incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses, which are planned and developed as a unit. The regulations in this article encourage the construction of creative small- to large-scale developments while providing relief from the subdivision and zoning regulations, which are designed for conventional developments. This article does not intend to promote the planned unit development solely as a tool to intensify density. Increased densities may be permitted when a planned unit development plat provides for adequate amenities and a wide range of open space opportunities that are in the general welfare of the community and consistent with the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(1)  The purpose of the planned unit development is to permit: 
a.  A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict application of the other sections of this chapter. 
b.  Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and facilities. 
c.  A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation and topographic and geological features. 
d.  A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that results in better development and design and construction of aesthetic amenities. 
e.  An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of utilities, streets and other facilities. 
f.  A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 1571, § 1, 8-10-2004) 
Sec. 106-352. - Procedure for approval.

a.  Procedure: A preliminary plat of the planned unit development shall be submitted to the mayor and board of trustees, who shall refer the plat to the plan commission for public hearing, report and recommendation as to whether or not the mayor and board of trustees should issue the special use permit applied for. The required procedure for review of the preliminary plat shall be: 
1.  Written application for approval of a planned unit development shall be made on forms and in the manner prescribed by rules of the village. 
2.  The application shall be accompanied by a fee, which shall be established by the mayor and board of trustees. 
3.  The preliminary plat and supporting data shall be in accordance with the stipulations of section 106-352 (B)(2). 
4.  Hearing required; notice of hearing. The plan commission shall hold a public hearing on the application for a planned unit development, giving notice of the time and place not more than 30 and not less than 15 days before the hearing by publishing a notice thereof at least once in a newspaper published or having general circulation within the village. 
5.  Review by planning and development administrator or designee.

(Ord. No. 1370, § 1, 12-12-2001; Ord. No. 1428, § 1, 11-12-2004; Ord. No. 1935, § 5, 3-24-2008; Ord. No. 2040, §§ 1, 2, 5-18-2009) 
Sec. 106-423. - Plan requirements; installation of landscaping. 
(a)  Plan requirements. The following shall establish the standards for the preparation and submission, if required, of plans for landscaping, screening and tree preservation: 
(1)  Uses requiring landscape plan. A landscape plan approved by the village board on the basis of the standards set forth in this article shall be required for all multi-family, commercial, and industrial development, and single-family and two-family residential developments receiving preliminary plat approval after December 18, 2001. 
(2)  Contents of plan. All landscape plans shall include or have attached thereto the following information: 
a.  North arrow, scale, and date of plan and any subsequent revisions. 
b.  The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed buildings, structures, parking lots and driveways, roadways and rights-of-way, sidewalks, bicycle paths, ground signs, refuse disposal areas, fences, freestanding electrical equipment, light fixtures, fire hydrants, other surface utility structures, and other freestanding structural features as determined by the planning and development administrator or designee, such as tot lots and other recreational facilities, setbacks and easements. The landscape plan shall be drawn at a scale not smaller than one inch equals 50 feet. 
c.  The location, quantity, size, and both scientific and common names of all proposed plant materials. 
d.  Existing and proposed contours, including the location of all proposed berming, at a one-foot contour interval. Also included shall be the location, extent and general elevations of all detention and retention areas and drainageways. 
e.  Specification of the type and boundaries of all proposed ground cover, including both scientific and common names of all proposed plant materials. 
f.  The designation, location, type and size of all existing trees four inches and larger in diameter measured one foot above natural grade. Any trees to be removed shall be clearly identified. Trees measuring between two and one-half and four inches in diameter, which will be used to meet landscape requirements, shall also be indicated. If required for reasons of clarity, this information may be placed on an additional illustration. Where existing trees are grouped in a dense cluster, an overall tree mass may be used without a specific delineation of individual trees. If this technique is used, protected trees used to meet site landscape requirements must be tagged on-site and identified on the plan in tabular form. 
g.  A table for each required landscaped area, including but not limited to, exterior parkway, interior parkway, perimeter area and storm water management area, indicating the total plant units summarized by species and type. Existing trees to be preserved and credit given towards the requirements of this article should be so noted. 
h.  Details of all fences and walls proposed to be constructed on the site. 
i.  Elevations, cross sections, sightline exhibits and other site or construction details determined to be necessary by the planning and development administrator or designee. 
j.  Symbols representing proposed plant material shall be drawn to scale showing two-thirds to full mature size and labeled as to quantity and type. 
(b)  Installation of landscaping. All required landscaping for residential developments shall be treated as public improvements; the developer shall post a letter of credit as surety for the satisfactory completion of these improvements as approved by the village board and processed in accordance with the procedures adopted as Resolution 98-13. For non-residential developments, landscaping shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for non-residential developments with occupancies granted from October 1 to April 30 provided the applicant presents the village with a cash bond to cover the cost of the landscape improvements. The cash bond shall be based upon 150 percent of a certified quote or the bid from the landscape contractor. The expiration date of any such bond shall be no later than November 1 following the issuance of the temporary occupancy permit. The village will call the bond if the subject improvements are not completed by the November 1 date. 
(Ord. No. 1370, § 1, 12-12-2001; Ord. No. 2040, §§ 3-5, 5-18-2009) 
Sec. 106-424. - Design standards. 
    The following shall establish standards for the landscape improvements required to be installed as part of the development of new subdivisions, buildings, structures and uses of land governed by this chapter: 
(1)  General standards and objectives. Every development shall provide sufficient landscaping so that: 
a.  Neighboring properties are shielded from the negative visual influence of that development. 
b.  The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses, including streets or railroads. 
c.  The appearance and desirability of the development contributes to the overall attractiveness and economic health of the village. 
(2)  Minimum landscaped open space. For each parcel of land to be developed, the minimum landscaped open space shall comply with the standards established in section 106-425 of this chapter. In zoning districts for which no minimum landscaped open space requirements are specified, a minimum of 15 percent of the total parcel shall be devoted to landscaped open space area. section 106-425 of this chapter details landscape requirements for various portions of the total landscaped open space. 
(3)  Flexibility in applying standards. To meet the objectives outlined in subsection (1) of this section, the landscape requirements in this section are hereby established. These standards provide specific requirements for site landscaping. However, the village recognizes that, because of the wide variety of types of developments and the relationships between them, some flexibility in applying the standards set forth in section 106-425 of this section are appropriate as long as the intent of the specified requirements is met. The Planning and Development Administrator or his/her designee may administratively vary up to 25 percent of any specific requirement of this chapter. Any deviation of 25 percent or more from the requirements of any specific requirement of this article shall require a variation. Whenever the village allows or requires deviation from the requirements set forth in this section, it shall enter on the face of the landscape plan the reasons for allowing or requiring deviation from the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. No. 1370, § 1, 12-12-2001) 
Sec. 106-425. - Required landscaping. 
(1)  Requirements for specific areas. This article regulates landscaping of seven distinct areas of a parcel as follows: exterior parkway, interior parkway, perimeter area, foundation area, parking lots, site interior, and stormwater management areas. Figures 1 and 2 provide graphic illustrations of each area. Some landscaping quantities are given in plant units. Table 2 provides plant unit values for plant types. All parcels subject to landscaping requirements must incorporate a minimum number of plant species in the design as shown in table 3.

(2)  Each area shall be landscaped in accordance with the following criteria: 
a.  Exterior parkway landscaping. Except for access drives, exterior parkways shall be landscaped per the following requirements: 
1.  Number of trees. One tree shall be required for each 40 lineal feet of street frontage. 
2.  Location. Trees shall be planted halfway between the curb and sidewalk, no less than 30 feet apart, at least ten feet from all driveways, manholes and fire hydrants and at least 30 feet from all streetlights. No tree shall be planted closer than 40 feet from an intersection as measured from the adjacent property corner. This distance is necessary to provide the necessary line of sight at the intersection. 
3.  Size. Trees planted shall be at least 21/2 inches in caliper measured six inches above grade. 
4.  Species. All trees planted in exterior parkways shall be chosen from the list of italicized large deciduous trees found in table 6, section 106-427. No tree species shall comprise more than 30 percent of all parkway tree plantings, unless authorized by the community development director or designee. No more than five trees of the same species shall be planted adjacent to one another. 
5.  All trees shall comply with the specifications found in chapter 78, article IV, section 78-145. 
6.  Large deciduous trees shall not be planted under utility wires. Subject to approval by the planning and development administrator or designee, understory (ornamental) trees may be allowed under utility wires. Recommended understory trees include: Amur Maple, Serviceberry (Amelanchier aborea), Eastern Redbud, Japanese Tree Lilac, Crabapple species ( fruitless and apple scab resistant cultivars only), Thornless Crus-galli Hawthorn, Corneliacherry Dogwood, Autumn Blaze Pear, Korean Sun Pear and Magnolia varieties . A mature tree height shall be provided to ensure no future conflicts with overhead utilities. 
b.  Interior parkway landscaping. An interior parkway shall be provided in all nonresidential zoning districts with the depths specified in table 1, above. Except for access drives, interior parkways shall be landscaped as follows: 
1.  Sites with parking between a public right-of-way or private road easement and the building. Where parking is provided between a public right-of-way or private road easement and the building, landscaping in a quantity equal to 75 plant units per 100 lineal feet of perimeter length shall be provided. Species and design considerations shall determine plant spacing. A maximum of 25 percent of the parking lot frontage may be left unscreened to permit design flexibility (see figure 3). However, when the landscape plan indicates a single row of shrubs, the entire parking lot frontage shall be screened. The remainder of the interior parkway shall be planted with ground cover, flowers or grass. Whenever the grade level of a parking lot after construction is three feet or more below the existing grade of the adjacent public street or private road, the required number of plant units in the interior parkway shall be 50. 

Figure 3 
2.  Sites without parking between a public right-of-way or private road easement and the building. Where no parking spaces will be located between a public right-of-way or private road easement and the building, landscaping in a quantity equal to 50 plant units per 100 lineal feet of perimeter length shall be provided. Species and design considerations shall determine plant spacing. The remainder of the interior parkway shall be planted with shrubs, ground cover, flowers or grass. 
c.  Perimeter landscape area. 
1.  Generally. The appropriateness of proposed perimeter landscaping will depend upon the relationship between the proposed use of the property and adjacent properties, and adjacent street classification. Three types of perimeter screening have been defined. Type 1 screening shall generally be required between residential and nonresidential uses. Type 2 perimeter landscape screening shall generally be required to provide screening of parking areas between adjacent nonresidential uses. Type 3 perimeter landscape screening shall generally be required between multi-family uses and all other residential areas, and for all residential developments adjacent to an arterial or collector as designated in the Comprehensive Plan. For any screening with a wood or masonry fence, required landscape elements must be installed between the fence and the property line. No perimeter landscaping shall be installed in the public right-of-way or on land designated for private roads. 
2.  Required screening when adjacent property is developed. Tables 4 and 5 in this section shall be used to determine the requirements for perimeter screening between uses. Where the adjacent property has already been developed, the required screening shall be governed by the existing use. Table 4 details screening and buffering requirements where the adjacent property has been developed. In cases where a mixed-use development exists on the adjacent parcel, the predominant use on that site shall determine the required screening.

3. Type 3 screening. 
3* Type 3 screening shall only be required when the site is adjacent to an arterial or collector designated in the Comprehensive Plan. 
When a proposed use is adjacent to a property zoned PUD, the zoning administrator shall determine appropriate screening required based on the most appropriate standard zoning district. 
3.  Required screening when adjacent property is undeveloped. Table 5 in this section shall be used to determine required screening where the adjacent property is undeveloped. Current county or village zoning shall determine the appropriate screening treatment unless the property is zoned Ag, in which case the comprehensive plan shall be used to determine the anticipated use and the resulting screening requirements.

2*. Type 2 screening unless site is adjacent to an arterial or collector designated in the Comprehensive Plan, in which case type 3 screening shall be required. 
3. Type 3 screening. 
3*. Type 3 screening shall only be required when the site is adjacent to an arterial or collector designated in the Comprehensive Plan. 
When a proposed use is adjacent to a property zoned PUD, the planning and development administrator shall determine appropriate screening required based on the most appropriate standard zoning district. 
4.  Type 1 screening. Type 1 perimeter landscape requirements are designed to provide a substantial buffer between uses. Where type 1 screening is required on tables 4 or 5, one of the following three buffering alternatives shall be required. The property owner may select the buffering alternative that best meets the configuration of the site and the proposed development. All fences, walls and hedges shall comply with section 106-11(7). 
i.  Alternate A: The buffering area shall be a minimum of eight feet in width for this alternative. An opaque brick or other approved masonry wall six feet high shall be constructed along the entire perimeter, excluding the area within the required front yard setback. The wall may be continued within the front yard provided the height is reduced to three feet. If the proposed usage is for a mining operation or for a related building or structure for screening, crushing, mining, washing or storage, the required masonry wall shall be eight feet high. In addition, landscaping in a quantity equal to 25 plant units per 100 lineal feet of perimeter length shall be provided. Species and design considerations shall determine plant spacing. A minimum of 30 percent of the required plant units must be from evergreen species. 

Alternative A 
ii.  Alternate B: A minimum 12-foot buffer area shall be required for this alternative. A fence of wood or other approved material six feet high and at least 75 percent opaque shall be constructed along the entire perimeter, excluding the area within the required front yard setback. The fence may be continued within the front yard provided the height is reduced to three feet. If the proposed use is for a mining operation or for a related building or structure for screening, crushing, mining, washing or storage, the required wood fence shall be eight feet high. In addition, landscaping in a quantity equal to 50 plant units per 100 lineal feet of perimeter length shall be provided. Species and design considerations shall determine plant spacing. A minimum of 30 percent of the required plant units must be from evergreen species. 

Alternative B 
iii.  Alternate C: A minimum 25-foot buffer area shall be required for this alternative. A berm at least three feet in height measured from both sides with a maximum 3:1 slope shall be constructed along the entire perimeter. Breaks in the berm may be provided as appropriate to accommodate drainage. Landscaping in a quantity equal to 100 plant units per 100 lineal feet of perimeter length shall be provided. Species and design considerations shall determine plant spacing. The berm shall be screened along at least 75 percent of the perimeter length. A minimum of 30 percent of the required plant units must be from evergreen species. 

Alternative C 
5.  Type 2 screening. Type 2 perimeter landscape screening is required between adjacent nonresidential uses to screen parking areas from adjacent uses. Where a parking lot will be placed along a perimeter such that parked cars will face the abutting property, a minimum 10-foot buffer area shall be required. Landscaping in a quantity equal to 50 plant units per 100 lineal feet of perimeter length shall be provided. A minimum of 30 percent of the required plant units must be from evergreen species. Species and design considerations shall determine plant spacing. Landscape screening shall be continuous along the entire parking area. Shrubs shall be a minimum of three feet in height when planted to screen a parking lot from adjacent nonresidential uses. If the proposed use is for a mining operation or for a related building or structure for screening, crushing, mining, washing or storage, an 8-foot high fence or wall shall be provided along the perimeter in lieu of parking lot screening. 
Where there will not be any parked cars facing the abutting property, a minimum 4-foot buffer shall be required. Landscape screening shall be continuous along the entire perimeter buffer area. 
6.  Type 3 screening. Type 3 perimeter landscape screening is generally required between multi-family uses and all other residential areas, and for all residential developments adjacent to an arterial or collector designated in the Comprehensive Plan. Where a type 3 screen is required according to tables 4 or 5, berming, trees and shrubs shall be provided to create a visual separation between properties. For all residential developments adjacent to an arterial or collector, a minimum 30-foot buffer area shall be required for this type. For all residential developments adjacent to I-80 or I-355, a minimum 50-foot buffer area shall be required for this type. For all other cases where a type 3 screen is required, a minimum 20-foot buffer area shall be required for this type. Minimum berm height shall be three feet, with no berm having a slope greater than 3:1. Landscaping in a quantity equal to 75 plant units per 100 lineal feet of perimeter length shall be provided. Species and design considerations shall determine plant spacing. A minimum of 30 percent of the required plant units must be from evergreen species. 
d.  Foundation area landscaping. A minimum six-foot wide landscape area is required adjacent to building walls, exclusive of driveways, access walks, and service and delivery areas. Planting should emphasize softening large expanses of building walls, accenting building entrances and architectural features, and screening mechanical equipment. At the discretion of the village board, foundation area landscaping along the front elevation of the building or any building elevation facing a public street may be provided through the use of above-ground planting containers or boxes meeting the intent of this section. Where extended roofs or canopies are used to provide a covered walkway adjacent to buildings, foundation plantings are not required. However, landscaping is recommended to separate vehicular areas from buildings. 
e.  Parking lot landscaping. Landscaping shall be required within all parking lots containing 20 or more parking spaces, to meet the following standards: 
1.  There shall be a minimum seven-foot wide (measured from back of curb) curbed planting island at the end of every parking row. The depth of the planting island shall be equal to the depth of the parking stall. There shall be a minimum of one large deciduous tree per island. Branching shall start no less than six feet above the pavement measured from pavement level (see figure 4). 

Figure 4 
2.  To break up long expanses of parking rows, landscape islands are required. One of the following four alternatives shall be used to divide parking rows of 20 or more parking spaces (see figure 5): 
i.  Alternative A: A continuous curbed landscape island between rows may be provided in lieu of full stall planting islands between parking bays. Where such a continuous island is provided, it shall be a minimum of seven feet in width and shall contain a minimum of one large deciduous tree per 20 spaces (see figure 5). Branching shall start no less than six feet above the pavement measured from pavement level. 
ii.  Alternative B: A maximum of 20 parking spaces is permitted in any length of parking bay. A curbed island at least seven feet wide, and as deep as the parking stalls, shall be provided to divide the bay length. There shall be a minimum of one large deciduous tree per island. Branching shall start no less than six feet above the pavement, measured from pavement level. 
iii.  Alternative C: Smaller curbed islands at the head of and between parking stalls may be permitted. If smaller curbed planting islands are appropriate, they shall be a minimum of six and one-half feet by six and one-half feet (measured from back of curb to back of curb) and shall be provided at the rate of two small islands for every full-size island required under alternative B. There shall be a minimum of one large deciduous tree per island. Branching shall start no less than six feet above the pavement, measured from pavement level. 
iv.  Alternative D : At the discretion of the village board, parking lot landscaping may be provided in an alternative manner, such as through the use of native plantings within a bio-swale or other best management practice (BMP). 

Figure 5 
3.  In addition to required trees, an appropriate planting of shrubs, ground cover plants, flowers, sod lawn and mulch shall be provided within all landscape islands. To ensure visibility, shrubs shall not exceed a mature height of 30 inches above the pavement on landscape islands at the end of parking rows. 
4.  In cases where a proposed light pole or fixture to be placed within a curbed landscape island conflicts with a required large deciduous tree, an understory (ornamental) tree as approved by the planning and development administrator or designee may be substituted in its place. The curbed landscape island shall contain a minimum of five additional plant units, such as ground cover and/or shrubs, to offset the loss of the large deciduous tree. 
5.  Parking lot landscape islands shall not be used for snow storage. Separate snow storage areas shall be designated on the landscape plan. 
6.  A minimum five-foot wide curbed planting bed or other width determined by the village board shall separate drive-through lanes from adjacent driveways, parking lot drive aisles or other vehicular areas. A continuous row of shrubs and ground cover shall be placed within this area. The village board may waive the requirement for a curbed planting bed separation between a drive-through and other vehicular areas, subject to additional landscaping being placed in other areas of the site to properly screen the drive-through from adjacent uses. 
f.  Site interior landscaping. 
1.  In developments with more than one structure, the open space between buildings shall be appropriately landscaped to provide: 
i.  Screening of adjacent dwelling units. 
ii.  Screening and shading to improve energy efficiency. 
iii.  A visually appealing living environment. 
2.  Open space areas within the interior of a site should generally contain a minimum of 20 plant units per 5,000 square feet of open space . 
g.  Storm water management areas. 
1.  In all zoning districts, storm water management areas shall be appropriately landscaped on all sides adjacent to residential uses or to a public or private roadway. The perimeter of the storm water management area shall be calculated as the lineal perimeter of the smallest regular geometric figure needed to completely encompass the pond when measured at the high water level. 
2.  In all developments, landscaping in a quantity equal to 35 plant units per 100 lineal feet of perimeter length shall be provided along the stormwater area perimeter. Species and design considerations shall determine plant spacing. Designs shall encourage natural groupings of plant elements. 
3.  If the storm water management screening requirements conflict with requirements for other landscaping areas, then the provisions requiring the greater number of plant units shall apply. 
4.  In addition to the above, native landscaping may be permitted for storm water management areas at the discretion of the village board, subject to the following: 
i.  Identification of all seed mixes, including, but not limited to, prairie, wet prairie and emergent wetland, and planting rates shall be noted on the plans. The mature height of all seed mixes shall be provided. The requirement of 35 plant units per 100 lineal feet of storm water area perimeter length shall be applicable for the balance of the required storm water area perimeter. 
ii.  A separate letter of credit shall be submitted to cover the naturalized landscape improvements. The letter of credit shall include the estimated cost of naturalized landscape installation, monitoring and establishment management. The establishment period for native landscaping shall be three years from the date of completion of the installation. 
iii.  The developer shall utilize a naturalized landscape specialist. Naturalized landscapes shall be installed and managed by individuals or companies with qualifications and/or experience with such landscapes. Qualifications are to be provided to the village through the submittal of references, photographs, resumes and/or other means that demonstrate the individual's or company's ability to install and/or manage naturalized landscapes. 
iv.  In order to ensure long-term maintenance of any naturalized landscape area not dedicated to a public agency after establishment and approval by the village, the property owner or owners' association shall hire a naturalized landscape specialist for routine inspections and maintenance, and shall provide the specialist's contact information to the village. To further ensure long-term maintenance if the owner or owners' association fails in its responsibilities, the village shall require the establishment of a special service area. 
v.  The owner, owners' association or other responsible party shall provide the village with a report on the naturalized landscaping noting any concerns and required actions to correct any problems every five years after the date the naturalized area is first established and approved by the village. 
vi.  An educational pamphlet explaining the environmental benefits, aesthetics, plant and wildlife habitat, and restrictions concerning mowing, cutting, dumping and placement of gardens or other structures within a naturalized detention area shall be created by the developer and shall be distributed to all buyers at the time of closing on each lot in the development. 
(3)  Design requirements. Functional activities within and adjoining the development site must be considered in the design of landscape improvements, including consideration of the following: 
a.  Service area screening. Service areas shall be screened from view through the use of evergreen plant materials or solid structural, non-plant material walls compatible with the proposed building design. 
1.  Trash dumpsters and other waste receptacles or equipment shall be screened with three-sided brick or other approved solid, non-plant material walls at least six feet in height, with a solid, attractive single or double access gate on one side only. The trash enclosure material shall match the materials and colors of the principal building. 
2.  All utility equipment (meters, transformers, etc.) shall be provided with appropriate planting screens. All ground-mounted dish antennas shall be adequately screened from adjoining properties by an opaque wall, fence, hedge or berm. 
3.  All garage doors and loading areas shall be fully screened so as not to be visible from adjoining property zoned for any residential use. 
4.  All outside storage facilities permitted in an industrial district shall be effectively screened from public rights-of-way, residential land uses, adjacent commercial uses and, unless waived by the village board, from all adjacent industrial uses by a solid wall or fence at least eight feet in height, and landscape screening shall be provided in addition to the fence or wall, installed along the outside perimeter of the fence or wall, equal to or exceeding the height of the materials to be stored outdoors. 
All outside storage permitted in a commercial district shall be effectively screened from public rights-of-way, residential land uses and all adjacent non-residential uses by a solid wall or fence, and landscape screening shall be provided in addition to the fence or wall, installed along the outside perimeter of the fence or wall, equal to or exceeding the height of the materials to be stored outdoors. In no case shall stored materials exceed the height of the provided screening. 
b.  Intersection visibility. Landscaping must be designed and installed to minimize potential obstruction of critical sight lines. Landscape planting shall be so designed as to avoid obstruction of a motorist's vision at the intersections of outlet access drives and ring roads, access roads or municipal streets. Unobstructed visibility between two feet and six feet above the height of the paved surface of the access road must be maintained at all intersections. To maintain this visibility, no shrubs or other landscape material which will reach a mature height greater than two feet shall be permitted within ten feet of the right-of-way of a major arterial, or five feet from the right-of-way of a lesser roadway, for a distance of 40 feet from the right-of-way intersection (see figure 6). Trees are not allowed in these critical visibility areas. 

Figure 6 
c.  Parking area planters. All parking area planters shall be over-excavated to a 2.5-foot depth for their entire width and length, shall be backfilled with an appropriate mix of black dirt, top soil, peat moss and nutrients to replace the excavated material, and shall be compacted, leaving a crowned or mounded top. Clay and stone shall not be used as backfill. Parking area planters shall be maintained so that the level of backfill is consistent with the top of curb. 
d.  Slope of berms. Berming shall not exceed a maximum slope of 3:1, except in parking islands, where the maximum slopes shall not exceed 2:1. 
e.  Mulch. Mulch materials shall be shredded bark or other organic material best suited for the area in compliance with the American Standards of Nursery Stock published by the American Association of Nurserymen. Lava rock or large diameter (11/2-inch diameter plus) bark chips ("chunk bark") are not acceptable. Gravel and stone mulches are not permitted, unless specifically approved in writing by the village. Mulch beds at the time of planting shall extend a minimum of two feet beyond the center of the shrub. Mulching shall be renewed on an annual basis, at a minimum, to ensure optimum plant health of the landscaping elements. 
f.  Fences. All wood fences proposed to be used to meet perimeter screening requirements shall be of red cedar, redwood, cypress or other approved decay-resistant treated wood, at least six feet high, and of solid construction. Wood fences shall be not less than 75 percent opaque, with all supporting posts exposed to the lot interior. Stockade type fences are not permitted.

Sec. 106-426. - Standards for plant materials; planting guidelines. 
    The following guidelines shall be considered in reviewing design and implementation of landscape plans in conjunction with review of site plans and special use permits: 
(1)  General standards for plant materials. Materials plans in any development shall comply with the following requirements: 
a.  The quality and size of plant materials selected shall comply with the latest edition of the American Standards of Nursery Stock, published by the American Association of Nurserymen, unless otherwise noted. 
b.  Plant material used in conformance with the provisions of this article shall be selected to provide climate hardiness of plant material, disease and pest resistance and stress tolerance, adaptability of proposed plant material to the particular microclimate (sun, shade, dry or wet soils,) in which it is located, inclusion of native plant material where appropriate, and overall year round ornamental effect. 
c.  Plant material shall be healthy, free of insects and diseases, physical damage (bark bruises, cracked branches, scrapes), and exhibit a central leader when applicable. 
d.  The use of stone, rock or gravel shall not be used as ground cover within any landscaped area, unless authorized by the village board when used as a decorative accent or as part of an appropriate landscape concept. 
e.  No artificial plants of any type shall be used to meet the requirements of this article in any landscape areas within the parcel. 
f.  Minimum sizes for plant materials at time of installation for all landscape areas shall be as follows: 
1.  Deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches caliper when installed. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height when installed. 
2.  Deciduous shrubs (other than dwarf varieties) shall be a minimum of four feet in height at time of installation if used as a perimeter screen planting, and 30 inches in height for all other installations. Dwarf varieties and plants normally measured by spread shall be a minimum of 24 inches in height/spread. 
3.  Ground cover shall be so planted and spaced that complete coverage can be obtained within two years after the date of installation. 
g.  Property owners shall be responsible for maintaining all landscaping shown on the approved landscape plans throughout the life of the development. In particular, landscaping shall be watered as often as needed to maintain optimum plant health. All dead plants shall be replaced with plants that meet original requirements. No changes shall be permitted without approval of the planning and development administrator, subject to Resolution 08-04. Annual flowerbeds shall be replanted each year with flowers adapted to the village. 
(2)  Guidelines for planting trees. The trees recommended in subsection (4) of this section have minimal maintenance requirements. However, all trees must receive a certain degree of care, especially during and immediately after planting. To protect an investment in a new tree, the developer shall ensure that proper horticultural techniques are followed. The following recommendations are provided as a guide for planting based on current horticultural practice: 
a.  The best times for planting are early spring and each fall. 
b.  Planted trees and shrubs shall be at least three feet from the back of curb along head-in parking spaces to prevent damage from car overhangs. Mulch, lawn or planted ground cover shall be utilized in this three-foot area. Aligning trees with the strip between parking stalls will further help avoid damage. 
c.  Tree pits should be dug at least one foot wider than the root ball. 
d.  Especially in areas where construction activity compacted the soil, the bottom of the pit shall be scarified or loosened with a pickaxe or shovel. 
e.  After a pit is dug, subsurface drainage conditions should be observed. Where poor drainage exists, special provisions shall be made to ensure proper drainage around the tree. 
f.  Backfill shall include a proper mix of soil, peat moss and nutrients. All roots must be completely covered. Backfill shall be thoroughly watered as it is placed around the roots. 
g.  Plants shall remain plumb and level. Newly planted trees must be supported with stakes and ties to hold the tree firmly in place. Stakes and ties should be removed after one year. 
h.  A three-inch saucer shall be provided at the outer edge of the rootball to form a basin around the trunk of the tree. This saucer helps catch and retain moisture. At least two inches of mulch should be spread over plant beds, not including the saucer, in order to retain moisture and keep down weeds. 
i.  The lower trunks of new trees must be wrapped with burlap or paper to prevent evaporation and sunscald. The wrapping shall remain on the tree for at least one year. 
j.  Conscientious post-planting care, especially watering, pruning and fertilizing, is a must for street and parking lot trees. Branches of new trees may be reduced by as much as one-third to prevent excessive evaporation. 
(3)  Guidelines for planting shrubs. Shrubs planted for screening purposes shall be given a proper growing environment. Many of the guidelines for tree planting listed in subsection (2) of this section also apply to shrubs. However, because specific requirements vary considerably between shrub types, this section does not attempt to specify the needs of all shrubs. 
(4)  Recommended trees, shrubs and ground covers. The lists in table 6 in section 106-427 indicate plantings that will meet the landscape requirements of this article. The lists are by no means comprehensive and are intended merely to suggest the types of flora that would be appropriate for these purposes. Plants were selected for inclusion on these lists according to four principal criteria: 
a.  General suitability for the climate and soil conditions of this area; 
b.  Ease of maintenance; 
c.  Tolerance of city conditions; and 
d.  Availability from area nurseries.
