PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the ordinances of the City of North Miami Beach, Florida of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1957 Code, as republished in 2008, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1957 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been arranged in the order requested by the City Council and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fifteenth section of Chapter 6 is 6-15. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 10-10 and 10-11 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 10-10.1, 10-10.2 and 10-10.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Kelly Heaton-Moniz, Editor, and Janet Cramer, Proofreader, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Pamela Latimore, City Clerk, and the other members of the City staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
CITY OF NORTH MIAMI BEACH 
Preamble. 
    We, the people of the City of North Miami Beach, in order to secure for ourselves the benefits and responsibilities of home rule and in order to provide for a municipal government to serve our present and future needs, do hereby adopt this charter and as part thereof adopt the following Citizens' Bill of Rights. 
Citizens' Bill of Rights. 
A)  This government has been created to protect the governed, not the governing. In order to provide the public with full and accurate information, to promote efficient administrative management, to make government more accountable, and to insure to all persons fair and equitable treatment, the following rights are guaranteed: 
1.  Convenient access. Every person has the right to transact business with the City with a minimum of personal inconvenience. It shall be the duty of the City Manager and the City Commission to provide, within the City's budget limitations, reasonable convenient times and places for required inspections, and for transacting business with the City. 
2.  Truth in government. No municipal official or employee shall knowingly furnish false information on any public matter, nor knowingly omit significant facts when giving requested information to members of the public. 
3.  Public records. All audits, reports, minutes, documents and other public records of the City and its boards, agencies, departments and authorities shall be open for inspection at reasonable time and places convenient to the public. 
4.  Minutes and ordinance register. The City Clerk shall maintain and make available for public inspection an ordinance register separate from the minutes showing the votes of each member on all ordinances (Ordinance means an official legislative action of the North Miami Beach Commission, which action is a regulation of a general and permanent nature and enforceable as a local law), and resolutions (Resolution means an expression of the North Miami Beach Commission concerning matters of administration, an expression of a temporary character, or a provision for the disposition of a particular item of the administrative business of the North Miami Beach Commission) listed by descriptive title. Written minutes of all meetings and the ordinance register shall be available for public inspection not later than thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the meeting, 
5.  Right to be heard. So far as the orderly conduct of public business permits, any interested person has the right to appear before the City Commission or any City agency, board or department for the presentation, adjustment or determination of an issue, request or controversy within the jurisdiction of the City. Matters shall be scheduled for the convenience of the public, and the agenda shall be divided into approximate time periods so that the public may know approximately when a matter will be heard. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City or any agency thereof from imposing reasonable time limits for the presentation of a matter. 
6.  Right to Notice. Persons entitled to notice of a City hearing shall be timely informed as to the time, place and nature of the hearing and the legal authority pursuant to which the hearing is to be held. Failure by an individual to receive such notice shall not constitute mandatory grounds for canceling the hearing or rendering invalid any determination made at such hearing. Copies of proposed ordinances or resolutions shall be made available at a reasonable time prior to the hearing, unless the matter involves an emergency ordinance or resolution. 
7.  No unreasonable postponements. No matter once having been placed on a formal agenda by the City shall be postponed to another day except for good cause shown in the opinion of the City Commission, or agency conducting such meeting, and then only on condition that any person so requesting is mailed adequate notice of the new date of any postponed meeting. Failure by an individual to receive such notice shall not constitute mandatory grounds for canceling the hearing or rendering invalid any determination made at such hearing. 
8.  Right to public hearing. Upon a timely request of any interested party a public hearing shall be held by any City agency, board, department or authority upon any significant policy decision to be issued by it, which is not subject to subsequent administrative or legislative review and hearing. This provision shall not apply to the law department of the City or to anybody whose duties and responsibilities are solely advisory. At any zoning or other hearing in which review is exclusively by certiorari, a party or his counsel shall be entitled to present his case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The decision of any such agency, board, department or authority must be based upon the facts in the record. Procedural rules establishing reasonable time and other limitations may be promulgated and amended from time to time. 
9.  Notice of action and reasons. Prompt notice shall be given of the denial in whole or in part of a request of an interested person made in connection with any municipal administrative decision or proceeding when the decision is reserved at the conclusion of the hearing. The notice shall be accompanied by a statement of the grounds for denial. 
10.  Manager's and Attorneys' reports. The City Manager and City Attorney shall periodically make a public status report on all major matters pending or concluded within their respective jurisdictions. 
11.  Budgeting. In addition to any budget required by state statute, the City Manager shall prepare a budget showing the cost of each department for each budget year. Prior to the City Commission's first public hearing on the proposed budget required by state law, the City Manager shall make public a budget summary setting forth the proposed cost of each individual department and reflecting the personnel for each department, the purposes therefor, the estimated millage cost of each department and the amount of any contingency and carryover funds for each department. 
12.  Quarterly budget comparisons. The City Manager shall make public a quarterly report showing the actual expenditures during the quarter just ended against one-quarter of the proposed annual expenditures set forth in the budget. Such report shall also reflect the same cumulative information for whatever portion of the fiscal year that has elapsed. 
13.  Adequate audits. An annual audit of the City shall be made by an independent certified public accounting firm in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The independent City Auditor shall be appointed by the City Commission; both appointment and removal of the independent City Auditor shall be made by the City Commission. A summary of the results of the independent City Auditor's annual audit, including any deficiencies found, shall be made public. In making such audit, proprietary functions shall be audited separately and adequate depreciation on proprietary facilities shall be accrued so the public may determine the amount of any direct or indirect subsidy. Duties, method of selection, and method of compensation of the independent City Auditor shall be established by ordinance. 
14.  Representation of public. The City Commission shall endeavor to provide representation at all proceedings significantly affecting the City and its residents before state and federal regulatory bodies. 
15.  Natural resources and scenic beauty. It shall be the policy of the City of North Miami Beach to conserve and protect its natural resources and scenic beauty. 
B)  The foregoing enumeration of citizens' rights vests large and pervasive powers in the citizenry of the City of North Miami Beach. Such power necessarily carries with it responsibility of equal magnitude for the successful operation of government in the City. The orderly, efficient and fair operation of government requires the knowledgeable participation of individual citizens exercising their rights with dignity and restraint so as to avoid any sweeping acceleration in the cost of government because of the exercise of individual prerogatives, and for individual citizens to grant respect for the dignity of public office. 
C)  Remedies for violations. In any suit by a citizen alleging a violation of this Bill of Rights filed in the Miami-Dade County circuit court pursuant to its general equity jurisdiction, the plaintiff, if successful, shall be entitled to recover costs as fixed by the court. Any public official or employee who is found by the court to have willfully violated this article shall forthwith forfeit his office or employment. 
D)  Construction. All provisions of this article shall be construed to be supplementary to and not in conflict with the general laws of Florida. If any part of this article shall be declared invalid, it shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.

2-74 - ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS. 
2-74.1   Use of City Property by Employees.
    No City employee or individual shall under any circumstances, other than those permitted by resolution of the City Council use, operate or cause to be used or operated any City equipment or properties of whatsoever nature of the City excluding public parks and playgrounds. 
(Ord. No. 205, 5-16-50; 1957 Code § 2-18) 
2-74.2   City Vehicles to Use Unleaded or Low-Lead Gasoline.
a.  Purpose. This section establishes a revised standard for gasoline designed to further the use of unleaded and low-lead content gasoline in motor vehicles. 
b.  Effective Date. This regulation is effective as soon as practical and feasible; however, existing contracts need not be revised or amended merely to conform to the provisions of this section. 
c.  Applicability. Provisions of this regulation apply to all motor vehicles owned and operated by the City of North Miami Beach and its departments. Taxi fleets under the jurisdiction of the City of North Miami Beach are encouraged to conform so that maximum benefits may be realized. 
d.  Background. The phasing out of the use of leaded gasoline is an important step toward cleaner air. Lead in gasoline has two (2) adverse effects: Lead emissions into the air can be harmful to health; and lead inhibits the use of other pollution control devices. In keeping with the City's goal of reducing pollution and improving the quality of the environment, it is appropriate that the City take full advantage of the availability of recently developed unleaded and low-lead content gasolines by using such fuels in City vehicles, except when it is clearly impractical or unfeasible to do so. The objective of this regulation, therefore, is to promote and effect the utilization of unleaded and low-lead content gasolines by providing an assured market for such fuels in City vehicles. The existence of such an assured market will hasten the development of refinery and distribution capability that can also serve the general motorist. 
e.  Use Standards for Gasoline. Unleaded or low-lead content gasoline (low-lead gasoline is defined as containing 0.5 gm./gal. lead) shall be used in City operated vehicles except when it is clearly impracticable or unfeasible to do so; however, manufacturers recommendations on octane requirements shall be generally followed. 
f.  Comments or Suggestions. Department views concerning the effect or impact of this section on department operations or programs should be submitted to the City Manager for consideration and, if practicable, incorporation into regulations to be issued by the City Manager. 
g.  Implementation. The purpose and intent of the foregoing subsections shall be incorporated into administrative regulations and directives by the City Manager in whatever manner he may deem advisable, with all deliberate speed.

    The City hereby adopts Section 255.065, Florida Statutes, entitled "Public-Private Partnerships; public records and public meetings exemptions" as amended. A public-private partnership ("P3") is a contractual agreement between a public agency (federal, state or local) and a private sector person or entity organized for the purpose of timely delivering services or facilities in a cost-effective manner that might not otherwise be possible using traditional sources of public procurement. Through this contractual agreement, the assets and professional skills of each sector (public and private) are shared and leveraged to deliver a service or facility to be used by the general public. Each sector shares in the potential risks of the timely and efficient delivery and operations of the service or facility. For a qualifying project/unsolicited proposal to be considered by the City, all parties must comply with this section and any adopted Guidelines for P3 Applications and Evaluation Process (hereinafter "Guidelines"). 
( Ord. No. 2018-11 , § 2, 10-16-18) 
3-5.2   Proposals.
a.  Solicited proposals. 
1.  The City may advertise for competitive proposals for a P3 project. The terms, evaluation criteria and selection process shall be outlined in the solicitation which may be made by a request for proposals, invitation to negotiate or other method as deemed appropriate by the City Manager and hereinafter referred to as a "solicitation". 
2.  Responses to a solicitation shall comply with all requirements of the soliciting document(s) and shall comply with any applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations, adopted guidelines, and ordinances pertaining thereto. 
3.  All responses to a solicitation for a P3 project shall be evaluated by the City as set forth in its guidelines. Final award decisions for P3 projects initiated by a solicitation shall be made by the City Commission, and as determined to be in the best interests of the City. 
b.  Unsolicited proposals. 
1.  Any proposals received without issuance of a solicitation, shall be treated as an unsolicited proposal and may be evaluated as prescribed in its guidelines. All proposals submitted shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 255.065, Florida Statutes. The City Manager shall have thirty (30) days to accept or reject any unsolicited proposals. 
2.  Contemporaneously with the submission of an unsolicited proposal, the proposer shall pay an initial unsolicited proposal application fee to the City in the amount of five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars, or such other amount as the guidelines may prescribe, to cover the costs of processing, reviewing and evaluating the proposal, including the fees and costs for private consultants to assist in the evaluation. Upon acceptance of the unsolicited proposal the initial unsolicited proposal application fee is non-refundable. The City shall require additional fees from the proposer if the initial unsolicited proposal application fee is insufficient to pay for the City's evaluation costs. 
3.  If the City Manager determines that it is interested in further considering any unsolicited proposal, it shall publish a notice of receipt of same and invite competing bids during a competitive bidding period. The advertising period of the notice of receipt and inviting competing bids shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the initial date of publication. The publication shall be accomplished in a manner that encourages competition to provide private entities interested in submitting alternative and perhaps competing proposals a reasonable opportunity to submit a bid. 
4.  Bidders submitting competitive bids in response to the notice of receipt shall comply with the requirements specified in the notice and pay a bid application fee as specified in the notice or the guidelines. The amount of the application fee shall be determined by the City Manager, on a case by case basis, and be reasonably calculated to cover the costs to be incurred by the City. The initial proposer(s) shall also submit a bid in response to the notice providing such further details about the unsolicited proposal as may be required by the notice. The initial proposer(s) shall receive a credit against the bid application fee for its initial unsolicited proposal application fee. 
5.  Bidders shall comply with all requirements of the notice of receipt as well as with any applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations, adopted guidelines, and ordinances pertaining thereto. 
6.  All unsolicited proposals and bids for a P3 project shall be evaluated by the City consistent with Section 255.065, Florida Statutes, and its guidelines. Final award decisions for P3 projects shall be made by the City Commission, and as determined to be in the best interests of the City.

9-30 - PROHIBITION OF RIGHT-OF-WAY VENDORS, PEDDLERS AND SOLICITORS ON CERTAIN ROADS. 
a.  Findings, Purpose, Intent. 
1.  The Mayor and City Council of the City of North Miami Beach desire to adopt an ordinance prohibiting right-of-way vendors, peddlers and solicitors on certain streets located in the City because such vendors, peddlers and solicitors pose a danger to themselves and the public at large by interfering with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic; 
2.  Based upon statistics collected by the Surface Transportation Policy Project, on average, five hundred sixty-five (565) pedestrians are killed every year in Florida (of which ninety-nine (99) are in Miami-Dade County), and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area is one of the most dangerous areas in the United States for pedestrians; 
3.  Numerous types of right-of-way vendors, peddlers and solicitors operate or may seek to operate within the City of North Miami Beach, including, but not limited to, children, adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for school and community activities; vendors who sell flowers, newspapers and other products and people who seek donations or to distribute information; 
4.  Right-of-way vendors, peddlers and solicitors approach motorists and passengers in motor vehicles engaged in travel on roads, and are particularly susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury or death due to the speed and number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the City; 
5.  Roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not suited to safely accommodate right-of-way vendors, peddlers and solicitors; 
6.  Over the past ten (10) years, at least ten (10) right-of-way vendors, peddlers or solicitors have been killed by motor vehicles in the South Florida area, and many more have been seriously injured (including a Sun Sentinel newspaper vendor who was struck by a car while carrying papers on U.S. 1 and Broward Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale on July 30, 2000); 
7.  The presence of right-of-way vendors, peddlers and solicitors interferes with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic; 
8.  The road network in the City is substantially burdened by a high volume of traffic; 
9.  It is the intention of the Mayor and City Council to use the least restrictive means to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety and, consequently, the City staff has analyzed each of the major roads within the City and has determined that the roads listed in paragraph c. below, pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by right-of-way vendors and solicitors, and therefore the City Council has determined that the prohibition on right-of-way vendors, peddlers and solicitors shall be limited to those listed roads; . 
10.  It is the finding of the City Council that many other alternative channels of communication (other than right-of-way vending, peddling and solicitation) exist for persons who seek to exercise their First Amendment freedoms, such as, but by no means limited to, solicitation of funds or distribution of literature through the mail or at alternate locations (such as houses of worship, shopping areas and special events); the sale and/or distribution of newspapers through home delivery, vending machines and retail stores; and the sale of items of all kinds at retail stores, through the internet and from vending machines; 
11.  The Mayor and City Council desire to protect the residents, citizens and visitors of the City of North Miami Beach from aggressive, obstructive and/or intimidating panhandling throughout the entire City; 
12.  The Mayor and City Council desire to preserve and protect the personal safety and quality of life of its residents and of those who use City streets, both pedestrians and motorists alike; and 
13.  The Mayor and City Council have reviewed the proposed regulations provided by this section and find that such regulations accomplish the purposes intended while utilizing the least restrictive method possible; and 
14.  The Mayor and City Council of the City of North Miami Beach, Florida, find that it is in the best interests of the residents and citizens of the City to adopt this section. 
b.  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms(s) have the meaning set forth herein, except as otherwise indicated by the context.

The term shall not apply to any person who merely holds or displays a sign lawfully permitted to be displayed by a person, as long as there is no entry by such person or sign into any portion of the roadway or its median. Further, this term shall not apply to official citations or notices provided pursuant to governmental authority. 
    Solicitation shall mean the request, either directly or indirectly, of any donation or contribution for charitable purposes, including but not limited to any oral or written request; the sale, offer to sell or attempt to sell any article, service, publication, advertisement, subscription, membership or other thing for charitable purposes; or, the making of any announcement to or through the press or other media concerning an appeal, drive or campaign to which the public is requested to make a donation.

(Ord. No. 2010-2 § 2, 2-10-10) 
9-31 - REGULATIONS FOR PEDDLERS AND SOLICITATION. 
9-31.1   Intent.
    The City Council declares that it is its intention to regulate door-to-door solicitation in residential neighborhoods and within the public rights-of-way within the City. The City Council finds and determines that generally commercial sales activities are prohibited within residentially zoned districts. Business activities within residential districts have only been allowed in the City on a very limited basis and subject to strict regulations intended to preserve the residential use and character of residential districts. The unregulated and uncontrolled business activity of door-to-door commercial solicitation is incompatible with the intended use of residential districts. The City Council further finds and determines that personal security in the home is a major concern. Burglaries, home invasions and sexual assaults have become common occurrence in residential areas. The City Council further finds and determines that deterring such crimes and providing for the security of residents in their homes is a significant governmental interest. The City Council further finds and determines that commercial door-to-door solicitation in residential districts should be subject to regulations.

i.  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in paragraphs a. and b. is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance, depreciates the value of adjoining property, harms the economic welfare of the City of North Miami Beach, Florida, and adversely affects the public's interest in the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment in the City of North Miami Beach.

Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in paragraphs a. and b. occur from operating within close proximity of educational institutions, religious institutions, areas zoned for residential use, and parks, at which children are customarily found, will serve to protect children from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments.

q.  Straddle dancing does not contain any element of communication, and is therefore conduct rather than expression.

b.  Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with, or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of Chapter XXIV, Zoning, of the Code of Ordinances, the Building Code, the Planning and Zoning Code, and Zoning Plan of the City of North Miami Beach shall be fined not more than five hundred ($500.00) dollars or shall be imprisoned for not more than sixty (60) days, or both, in the discretion of the County court.

14-8.17   Administrative Fines; Costs of Repairs; Liens.
a.  The Board or Special Magistrate, upon notification by the Code Inspector that a previous order of the Board has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine not to exceed two hundred fifty ($250.00) dollars for each day the violation continues past the date set for compliance and a fine not to exceed five hundred ($500.00) dollars per day for repeat violations and in addition may include all costs of repairs. 
1.  Repeat violation means a violation of the City Code and ordinance by a person who has been previously found through a Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate to have violated or who has admitted violating the same provision within five (5) years prior to the violation even though the violation occurred at different locations. 
b.  If the violation involves a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate shall notify the City. The City may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine. Making such repairs does not create any liability upon the City for damages to the property if the repairs were completed in good faith. 
c.  If, after due notice and a hearing, the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars per violation. 
d.  The Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate may reduce a fine. 
e.  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists or, if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the Circuit Court, the order shall be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the Sheriffs of this State, including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed otherwise to be judgment of a court except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or a judgment is rendered. A lien from a fine runs in favor of the City and City may execute a satisfaction or release of lien. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the Board or Special Magistrate may authorize the City Attorney to foreclose on the lien or to recover money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest.

14-8.18   Duration of Liens.
    No lien shall continue for a period longer than twenty (20) years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded unless an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced first. In an action to foreclose on a lien, or for money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs and a reasonable attorney's fee. City shall also be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. Actions for money judgments under this chapter be pursued only on fines levied after October 1, 2000. 
(Ord. No. 2000-4 § 6-117, 5-2-00) 
14-8.19   Appeals.
    An aggrieved party, including the City, may appeal a final administrative order of the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate to the Circuit Court.

a.  All applications for water supply service must be made at the customer service office at the City Hall on a blank form prepared by the City for that purpose. 
b.  The owner of the premises proposed to be connected for water supply service, or his agent thereof duly authorized in writing, must sign the application for service pipe and water supply, except as hereinafter provided. 
c.  Such application becomes a binding contract upon both the owner and the City when the service connections for water supply service applied for have been installed and completed. Prior to the installation of such service connections, the owner may cancel or withdraw the application upon his written order to do so, after payment to the City for actual expense, of not less than one ($1.00) dollar, incurred by the City in connection therewith. 
d.  All contracts for water supply service shall expire at the end of the next succeeding calendar month from date of application, but all contracts shall be renewed without act or notice from either party to the other, from month to month, unless ten (10) days' notice is given in writing from either party to the other of the desire to terminate the contract at the expiration of the then calendar month, and all charges are paid in full. Payment of charges at any interval or period, other than monthly shall not be construed as altering the period of the contract or the renewals thereof under this rule. 
e.  In the event of any change in ownership or occupancy of any premises connected to the system, the City shall be immediately notified in writing of such change, giving in such notice the name of the new owner or occupant. In the absence of application for service, such new owner or occupant, the use of the City service may, at the option of the City, be taken and construed as acceptance by such new owner or occupant of all contract obligations of the preceding owner with the City. In the event any owner fails to notify the City in writing of the change in ownership or occupancy of any premises for water supply service, such owner shall continue to be liable to the City for all rates and charges accrued and accruing for such service until either the end of the contract period, in which he may then notify the City of his desire to cancel, or the City shall, of its own volition, have canceled the contract with the owner, but this clause shall not preclude the City from also demanding from the new owner or occupant the payment of all or any charges which shall, at the time of such demand, be unpaid or unsecured without regard to whether the same accrued prior or subsequent to such change in ownership or occupancy. Upon failure of such new owner to comply with such demand within twenty-four (24) hours after written notice thereof, the City shall have the right to shut off the water supply and discontinue the service. In no case of change of ownership shall the preceding owner or owners be released from any contract obligations with the City until the expiration of the contract, properly terminated in accordance with these rules and regulations, except at the option of the City, evidenced by a written release from the City. 
f.  When application for water supply service is made, the service together with the charges and rates therefor shall begin on the date of the completion of the service connection by the City unless the owner shall state in writing in the application that the service connection shall be shut off immediately upon its installation, in which event the connection shall then be shut off and shall thereafter be turned on by the City only upon the written request of the owner, in which event the charges and rates for water supply service shall commence on the date of such turn-on, in accordance with these rules and regulations in every respect as though such turn-on request had been an original application. However, in a case hereinabove provided, where there shall have been a change in ownership prior to a turn-on of the service connection, the new owner shall sign the application for water supply upon the regular form.

b.  In every instance of needed water supply service, the owner shall provide and maintain the location for the meter, acceptable to the City. When any meter has once been placed, its position shall not be changed, except by the City and with its consent, the cost to be paid by the owner, and in the event any owner makes any change in his premises, which in the discretion of the City requires any change in the location or position of the meter or meter box, such change in location or position shall be made by the City at the cost of the owner. 
c.  Repairs, renewals and replacements of all water meters and meter boxes, with connections and appliances, shall be made by the City at its own expense where such repairs, renewals and replacements are due to the ordinary wear-and-tear of service. 
d.  Reading of meters are to be made monthly and if the meter is in good order and has been in good condition during the time since the last reading, bills are rendered in accordance therewith; but the City reserves the right at its option, in the case of large users of water supply service, or for any other reason deemed by it to be sufficient, to read any meter or meters and render any bills therefor in the same manner as stated above for quarterly readings, and monthly or more frequent intervals. All readings of meters shall be taken as near as practicable on the same calendar day of each month. 
e.  All meters shall be carefully tested before they are installed and after their installation they shall be tested as frequently as circumstances warrant. Should the owner, at any time, question the accuracy of the meter on his service, the City shall upon his written application, accompanied by the payment of one ($1.00) dollar for each meter in question to cover the cost of test thereof, remove the meter and test it in the presence of the owner or his authorized agent, if such presence is desired by the owner. If the test shows the meter has been over registering more than two (2%) percent, the one ($1.00) dollar paid shall be returned to the owner, and bill rendered based on the last reading of such meter or meters accordingly. If the test shows that the meter is not over registering more than two (2%) percent, as aforesaid, the one ($1.00) dollar paid by the owner shall be retained by the City and in addition thereto, if the test shows that the meter has been under registering more than two (2%) percent, as aforesaid, the one ($1.00) dollar paid by the owner shall be retained by the City and the bill rendered based on the last reading of such meter or meters, shall be corrected accordingly. The City reserves the right to remove and test any meter at any time, and if such meter is found to be inaccurate to substitute another meter of the same size in its place, either permanently or temporarily. In the event of such test last mentioned, the City further reserves the right to make any corrections on bills rendered based on the last reading of such meter, in accordance with the result of such test. 
f.  Quantity of water recorded by the meter shall be conclusive on both the owner and the City except when the meter has been found to be defective, or ceases to register. In case the meter has been found to be defective or has ceased to register the quantity of water since the last reading shall be determined by the average registration of another meter for a period of twenty (20) days, or for the same meter for a like period after it had been repaired, and tested; or by mutual agreement, the quantity of water supplied may be prorated upon the previous corresponding period of the last reading, preceding the time the meter has been or became defective or has failed to register to the time such meter is repaired or replaced. 
g.  The owner or consumer at every premises shall pay to the City the sum of five ($5.00) dollars for each time the seal on any meter or its coupling on or for such premises is found broken or removed. The City hereby reserves the right to put on such seal in or for any premises at any time, and upon the second occurrence, the City may, at its option shut off the supply and discontinue its service, and may further refuse to again turn on the same and resume its service to such premises, so long as the owner of or consumer of the premises, at the time of the breaking or removal of such seal, shall continue to be the owner of or consumer at the premises.

(1957 Code § 23-13; Ord. No. 213 § B, 8-4-50; Res. No. R74-78 § 1, 11-5-74) 
19-14.2   Installation of Service Equipment, Tapping.
a.  The City shall lay the service pipe to the property line of the owner who has signed the contract for water service provided the property lines correspond with such lot lines as are dedicated and recorded in the subdivision plat. In other words, the City will not run service connections to lots or parts of lots that have been divided and for which no provisions and recording of easements or alleys have been made for water supply lines. 
b.  In case service supplying a house or building is found not to be large enough due to additions to buildings or an increase or change in the number of fixtures, the City will make the larger tap and install the service upon the payment of the tapping charge for the size of the new service. No credit will be given for the service already placed and found to be insufficient in size. The owner shall be required to place a gate valve on the service between the building and the meter box so that the supply may be turned off by the owner or the City in case of a break or repair being made to the building. 
c.  The City in every instance reserves the right, at its option, to designate and prescribe the size of the service connection, either upon original installation of a new connection or upon any renewal or replacement of any old connection.

d.  The City reserves the right, at its option, where and when and in its discretion, the conditions may or might require it, at any time, to require any owner to install on his service connection, tank, check valve or valves, cock or gate valve, pressure regulator or other appliances, apparatus or equipment of such types or designs as are approved by the City and thereafter to require any change, alteration, substitution, or addition of and to any such tank, etc., as aforesaid, and failure upon the part of the owner to comply with such requirements of the City upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the owner, or within some agreed extension beyond such thirty (30) days, also in writing, shall authorize the City at its option, without further notice, to cancel the contract for such services and discontinue the same. 
(Ord. No. 213 § G, 8-4-50; 1957 Code § 23-14) 
19-15 - CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL PROGRAM. 
19-15.1   Definitions.
    As used in this section: 
    Auxiliary supply shall mean any water source or system, other than the public potable water supply, that may be available in a building or premises. 
    Back pressure shall mean backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or other means that could create pressure within the system greater than the supply pressure. 
    Back siphonage shall mean a form of backflow due to a negative or subatmospheric pressure within a water system. 
    Backflow shall mean the flow, other than the intended direction of flow, of any foreign liquids, gases or substances, into the distribution system of a public water supply. 
    Backflow prevention device shall mean a device or a mechanical assembly to prohibit backflow into potable water system or back pressures or prevent back siphonage. The following types of backflow devices may be approved: 
a.  Air gap separation (AG) shall mean unobstructed vertical physical separation between the free-flowing discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and the flood level rim of an open or non-pressure receiving vessel. An approved air gap separation shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the top of the rim of the vessel. In no case shall an air gap separation be less than one (1) inch. 
b.  Double check detector assembly (DCDA) shall mean a specially designed assembly composed of a line-size approved double check valve assembly with a bypass containing a specific water meter and approved double check valve assembly. The meter shall register accurately for only very low rates of flow up to three (3) gallons per minute (gpm) and shall show a registration for all rates of flow. The DCDA is used only on fire systems. 
c.  Double check valve assembly (DC) shall mean an assembly composed of two (2) single, independently acting approved check valves, including tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly, and fitting with property located resilient seated test cocks suitable for testing the water tightness of each check valve. A check valve is a valve that is drip-tight in the normal direction of flow when the inlet pressure is one (1) psi and the outlet pressure is zero. The check valve shall permit no leakage in a direction reverse to the normal flow. The closure element (e.g., clapper) shall be internally weighted or otherwise internally loaded to promote rapid and positive closure. This assembly shall be used only to protect against a nonhealth hazard. 
d.  Pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) shall mean an assembly consisting of an independently operating internally loaded check valve and an independently operating loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve, with properly located resilient-seated test cocks and tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves attached at each end. The PVB prevents backsiphonage, but is not effective, and should not be used, in backpressure conditions. 
e.  Reduced pressure detector assembly (RPDA) shall mean a specially designed assembly composed of a line-size approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly with a bypass containing a specific water meter and an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. The meter shall register accurately for only very low rates of flow up to three (3) gpm and shall show a registration for all rates of flow. The RPDA is used only on fire systems. 
f.  Reduced pressure principle backflow preventer (RP) shall mean an assembly containing within its structure a minimum of two (2) independently acting approved check valves, together with an automatically operating pressure differential relief valve located between the two (2) check valves. The first check valve reduces the supply pressure by a predetermined amount so that during normal flow and at cessation of normal flow the pressure between the checks shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. These units are equipped with tightly closing resilient seated shut-off valves located at each end of the assembly, and with properly located resilient seated test cocks. 
    Cross-connection shall mean any temporary or permanent physical arrangement whereby a public water supply is connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device which contains, or may contain, contaminated water, sewage or other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply as a result of backflow. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or change-over devices, and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which, backflow could occur are considered to be cross-connections. 
    Public water supply shall mean any system or water supply intended for use or actually used for human consumption or other domestic uses including source, treatment, storage, transmission and distribution facilities, where water is furnished to any community, collection, or number of individuals, or is made available to the public for human consumption or domestic use, excluding water supplies serving individual single-family residences.

    The Department of Public Utilities of the City of North Miami Beach, in cooperation with the appropriate health officers, shall make periodic inspections of all premises served by the City's water supply system to check for the presence of cross-connections. Any cross-connections found shall be ordered removed, if possible, in the determination of the Department and the health official. If an immediate hazard to health is presented by the cross-connection, water service to the premises may be discontinued until the cross-connection has been removed. As an alternative to eliminating the cross-connection, a backflow prevention device shall be installed at the service connection or within any premises where, in the judgment of the Department of Public Utilities, the inclusion of such a device is necessary to protect the integrity of the water supply system. The following are examples of situations where such devices shall be required: 
a.  Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the auxiliary supply is in compliance with applicable Federal laws, and is acceptable to the Department; 
b.  Premises having internal cross-connections that are not correctable, or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether or not a cross-connection exists; 
c.  Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross-connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or on short notice to assure that cross-connections do not exist; 
d.  Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the public water supply or where cross-connection could reasonably be expected to occur. This shall include the handling of processed waters and cooling waters; 
e.  Premises where materials of toxic or hazardous nature are handled so that if back siphonage should occur, a serious health hazard may result;

a.  Each builder and developer of construction within the City of North Miami Beach and without the City of North Miami Beach, but within the service area of the Public Utilities Department of the City of North Miami Beach, and also within the area wherein the City is selling or servicing bulk water, or is required so to do, shall hereafter pay their fair share to the City of North Miami Beach of the cost, expense and capital contribution of the in-plant expansion and upgrading necessary to provide and service such increased demand with the amount of potable water required to be supplied daily for the construction and its new and additional consumers. 
b.  The amount of gallonage necessary and required by such new construction, additions, or modifications to existing constructions requiring additional water; and new and additional consumers shall be estimated, determined and fixed solely by the City of North Miami Beach's Public Utilities Department or such other Department or person as designated by the City Manager, who will apply, in computing such estimate, the South Florida Code where applicable, and such other recognized methods of estimating gallonage usage, and in accordance with modern, sanitary engineering practices. The City of North Miami Beach may require a certified statement by a licensed engineer or architect certifying to the amount of gallonage required by the new or modified construction. 
c.  Computation of amount due; letter of allocation and commitment: 
1.  Each future builder, developer and owner of new construction, simultaneously with the issuance of a permit and/or letter of commitment by the Public Utilities Department of the City, in addition to any and all other payments, shall be charged and pay to the City of North Miami Beach a sum to be computed on the basis of the estimated gallonage, as mentioned in paragraph b. hereof, as follows: 
For each gallon per day, the sum of five dollars and twenty-two cents ($5.22) per gallon. 
2.  Any and all bulk users who purchase potable water from the City shall, prior to any connection to any new development or building within its service area, seek permission and approval by way of a request for letter of allocation and commitment. Upon approval by the City, after payment to the City of the appropriate in-plant charge as stated in paragraph c.1. above, the bulk user may make the necessary connections from the new building and/or development to its system for potable water. 
3.  It is the obligation and responsibility of all bulk users and purchasers from the City's potable water system not to hook up any additional connections to new developments and/or buildings within its service area without first having obtained the necessary letter of approval for allocation by the City of North Miami Beach and proof of payment of the in-plant cost as mentioned in paragraph c.1. above. In the event the bulk users fail to comply with the foregoing provisions, it shall then be the personal responsibility and obligation of the bulk user to make the full payment to the City for the in-plant charge. 
d.  The charge or rate set forth in paragraph c. hereof may be changed by the adoption of City ordinances or resolutions from time to time at the sole discretion of the City Council, based upon technical and documentary information submitted to the Council by the consulting engineer of the City, or by other advisory personnel or professionals selected by the City Council. 
e.  The monies collected pursuant to this section shall be kept and placed in a separate interest-bearing account of the City, and shall be designated as an "In-plant Expansion and Upgrading Fund of Water System," until the opportunity arises for the use thereof toward payment of the cost and expense of the future water expansion and upgrading programs, as approved and directed hereafter by the City Council. 
f.  All in-plant fees charged in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be assessed in a uniform manner as set forth in paragraphs b. and c., and shall be collected in full by the City of North Miami Beach's Utilities Department prior to the approval of any plans and prior to the issuance of any permits or licenses. 
g.  In the event that such gallonage cannot be determined at the time the payment of the in-plant fee is due, an initial estimate of gallonage will be made based on the criteria set forth in paragraphs b. and c. herein. The initial estimate shall be designated as a minimum only. If an evaluation of the average daily gallonage used by such new or modified construction two (2) years after the completion of construction reveals that the actual gallonage usage exceeds the original estimate by ten (10%) percent, the in-plant fee will be adjusted to reflect the actual amount, and the difference between the cost for the estimated gallonage and the actual gallonage for the entire period of water use shall be assessed against the property. Payment of the adjusted amount, as well as interest and penalties, shall be due in full within thirty (30) days from the date the adjusted assessment is made. In the event that the initial estimate exceeds the actual gallonage, a refund shall be available without interest after application to and approval by the Mayor and City Council. This section shall apply only to specialty new construction, modifications or additions which, due to their unusual nature, render the City of North Miami Beach incapable of calculating an accurate in-plant fee prior to evaluating the actual use after completion of construction. 
h.  All adjusted assessments as set forth in paragraph g. above shall bear interest at the rate of one (1%) percent per month from the date of the payment of the in-plant fee. 
i.  A penalty in the amount of ten (10%) percent of the actual adjusted in-plant fee shall be assessed against the property for each deviation from the initial gallonage estimate as defined in paragraph g. above. Payment of the penalty shall be due within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice of the adjusted assessment as set forth in paragraph g. above.

22-9 - GRANT OF FRANCHISES. 
a.  The City may grant a Franchise for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years. 
b.  The City may make the grant of a Franchise conditioned upon the completion of construction within a reasonably prescribed time or upon the performance of other specific obligations that are to be set forth in the Franchise agreement, specifying that failure to comply with the condition may be considered a violation of this ordinance and any Franchise granted hereto and as such may require the Franchisee to pay penalties to the City as specified in Section 22-4 hereof or as set forth in a Franchise agreement. 
c.  In evaluating an Application for an initial Franchise, the City may consider, among other things, the following factors: the technical, financial and legal qualifications of the Applicant to construct and operate the proposed system; the adequacy of the proposed construction arrangements, facilities, equipment and services based on the public convenience, safety and welfare; the experience of the Applicant in constructing and operating Cable Systems and providing Cable Service in other communities, if any; the ability of City streets to accommodate the proposed system; the potential disruption to users of City streets and any resultant inconvenience to the public; and whether the proposal shall meet reasonably anticipated community needs and serve the public interest. Evaluation by the City shall not be based on the content of the programming the Applicant proposes to provide. 
d.  The City shall hold a public hearing to consider an Application or Applications for a grant, renewal or transfer of a Franchise. The Applicant shall be notified of the hearing and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Based upon the Application, the relevant testimony presented at the public hearing, any relevant recommendations of the City or staff, and any other information relevant to the Application, the City shall decide by resolution whether to lawfully grant or deny a Franchise, Franchise renewal or transfer. 
e.  An Applicant for an initial grant, renewal, transfer or modification of a Franchise hereunder shall reimburse the City for all expenses incurred by the City in considering and processing the Application, including, but not limited, to costs and expenses resulting from accrued City in-house staff time, out of pocket expenses or administrative costs and consulting and legal fees and costs, less the amount of the filing fee paid pursuant to subsection 22-8i. Prior to the effective date of the Resolution approving or denying the initial grant, transfer or renewal of the Franchise thereof by the City Council, the City shall bill the Applicant for the estimate amount of the processing fee and its method of calculation. Franchisee shall pay a late fee at the rate of eighteen (18%) percent per annum of the amount of the unpaid or underpaid costs provided, however, that such rate does not exceed the maximum amount allowed under applicable law. The fee is due and payable to the City no later than the time of approval of the Franchisee by the City Council. Any additional costs or fees not incorporated within the aforesaid estimate shall be billed to the Franchisee and due within thirty (30) days of receipt of the bill. The City shall notify such Applicant and any approval granted by such Resolution shall be null and void without further action by the City. This processing fee is intended to be a charge incidental to the awarding or enforcing of a Franchise within the meaning of Section 622(G)(2)(d) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 542(G)(2)(d), and may not be deducted from the Franchise fee. To the extent any such costs are applicable to more than one (1) licensed Franchised Cable Operator, the cost shall be allocated on a weighted pro rata share of all City subscribers. 
f.  The City Council shall approve or disapprove the proposed Franchise agreement by Resolution.

c.  A Franchisee shall keep on file with the City certificates of insurance.

If a potential claim is filed such that the City claims insurance coverage, Franchisee shall immediately respond to all reasonable requests by the City for information with respect to the scope of the insurance coverage. 
d.  All insurance policies shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof has been given to the City. A Franchisee shall not cancel any required insurance policy without submission of proof that the Franchisee has obtained alternative insurance satisfactory to the City that complies with Chapter XXII. 
e.  A Franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless, waive subrogation against and defend the City, its officials, boards, officers, attorneys, agents and employees, against any and all third party claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or equitable relief and costs and expenses arising out of the construction, maintenance or operation of its Cable System by the Franchisee, its agents or employees, the conduct of Franchisee's business by the Franchisee, its agents or employees in the City, or the granting of a Franchise agreement to the Franchisee or in any way arising out of the Franchisee's enjoyment or exercise of a Franchise granted hereunder, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by Chapter XXII or a Franchise agreement. However, Franchisee's obligation pursuant to this Section shall not extend to claims arising from the negligence or willful misconduct of the City, its employees, officers, boards, City Council members and agents or to claims arising from Franchisee's provision of Access Channels for public, educational and/or governmental use pursuant to Section 22-15 hereof, if applicable, and a Franchise agreement, to the extent such claims relate to programming and content on such Channels over which Franchisee has no editorial control nor exercises administrative control. This provision includes, but is not limited to, the claims arising out of copyright infringements or a failure by the Franchisee to secure consents from the owners, exclusive of local government or local education programming, authorized distributors, or providers of programs to be delivered by the Cable System, claims arising out of Section 638 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 558, and claims against the Franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right of any person. The City shall give the Franchisee written notice within twenty (20) days of the City receiving notice of any claim or of the commencement of any action, suit or other proceeding covered by the indemnity in this Section. If any such claim arises, the Franchisee shall have the obligation and duty to defend the City and any other indemnified party hereunder; provided, however, Franchisee may not agree to any settlement of claims affecting the City without the City Attorney's approval. If the City Attorney finds that separate representation to fully protect the interests of the City is necessary, Franchisee shall consult with the City Attorney on counsel that is acceptable to the City Attorney. If Franchisee is unwilling or unable to select counsel acceptable to the City Attorney, whose acceptance shall be withheld only for good cause shown. Franchisee shall pay all reasonable actual expenses incurred by the City in defending itself with regard to any action, suit or proceeding subject to this indemnification. The City's expenses shall include all out of pocket expenses, reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the City Attorney or assistants, or any City employees, outside attorneys or other agents. 
f.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a Franchisee shall be responsible for all actions of the subcontractors and shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the City for any and all claims against the City or arising out of the activity of such subcontractors. 
(Ord. No. 2004-2 § 10, 3-16-04) 
22-11 - SECURITY FUND. 
a.  The City shall require in a Franchise agreement that as a condition precedent to a Franchise becoming effective, the Franchisee shall post a security fund with the City. Such fund may be in the form of a cash deposit, letter of credit, or performance bond as set forth in a Franchise agreement. The security fund shall be used to guarantee the compliance with performance requirements and payment of all sums which may become due to the City under this ordinance and/or any Franchise Agreement entered into by the City and Franchisee. The amount of the security fund shall be the amount that the City determines, under circumstances existing at the time, that is necessary to protect the public, and to enable the City to effectively enforce compliance therewith, but in no event less than one hundred thousand ($100,000.00) dollars. The Franchise agreement shall provide for the procedures to be followed with respect to the security fund. Neither the posting of the cash deposit or filing of an indemnity bond or any form of performance bond with the City, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the City thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the Franchisee or limit the liability of the Franchisee under the terms of its Franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the fund or otherwise. 
b.  The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by Chapter XXII or authorized by other law or the Franchise agreement, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the City may have. 
(Ord. No. 2004-2 § 11, 3-16-04) 
22-12 - CONSTRUCTION BOND. 
a.  The City shall require in a Franchise agreement that, prior to any Cable System construction, upgrade, rebuild or other significant work in the streets, a Franchisee shall establish in the favor of the City a construction bond in an amount specified in the Franchise agreement or other authorization as necessary to ensure the faithful performance of the Franchisee of the construction, upgrade, rebuild or other work. 
b.  If a Franchisee subject to such a construction bond fails to complete the Cable System construction, upgrade or other work in the streets in a safe, timely and competent manner according to the provisions of the Franchise agreement following reasonable prior written notice, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the Franchisee, or the cost of completing or repairing the system construction, upgrade or other work in the streets, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The City may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against the security fund pursuant to Section 22-11 hereof where such amount exceeds that available under the security fund. 
c.  The Franchise agreement may specify that upon completion of the Cable System construction, upgrade, rebuild or other work in the streets and payment of all construction obligations of the Cable System to the satisfaction of the City, the City may eliminate the bond or reduce its amount. However, the City may subsequently require an increase in the bond amount for any subsequent construction, upgrade, rebuild or other work in the streets. 
d.  The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a minimum rating acceptable to the City and shall provide that this bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty (60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew. 
e.  The rights reserved by the City with respect to any construction bond established pursuant to this Section are in addition to all other rights and remedies the City may have under Chapter XXII, the Franchise agreement, or at law or equity. 
(Ord. No. 2004-2 § 12, 3-16-04) 
22-13 - MINIMUM FACILITIES AND SERVICES. 
a.  The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply to all Franchises granted by the City. The City may require in a Franchise agreement that a Franchisee exceed these minimum requirements where it determines, under circumstances existing at the time of the grant of the Franchise, that the additional requirements are necessary to meet the future cable-related needs of the City and interests or to serve the public interest. 
1.  Any Cable System granted an initial Franchise or a renewal of a Franchise shall agree to construct a system with a minimum capacity of at least seven hundred fifty (750) MHz, or the equivalent thereto, including two-way capability, or as set forth in a Franchise agreement. The construction, rebuild, upgrade or reconstruction of any Cable System must be completed within a twelve (12)-month construction schedule, unless such other time period is set forth in a Franchise agreement. A Franchise agreement may provide for a larger minimum channel capacity requirement as well as upgrades during the term of a Franchise. Franchisee's failure to rebuild to at minimum seven hundred fifty (750) MHz, or the equivalent thereto, by the time specified in a Franchise or other agreement shall result in the imposition of liquidated damages in an amount of no less than two thousand one hundred ($2,100.00) dollars per day or each part thereof that the violation continues. 
2.  The City may require in a Franchise agreement that a Franchisee provide access channels, facilities and other capital support for educational and/or governmental use, in excess of the minimum requirement of Chapter XXII.

4.  Upon request and as specified in a Franchise agreement, a Franchisee shall, at minimum, provide at least one (1) cable television service outlet and shall provide basic and expanded basic Cable Services to each accredited public school (k-12) in the Franchise area that are within one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet of the existing Cable System and to which the Franchisee has access.

5.  A Franchisee shall, upon request, and at no charge to the City, provide at least one (1) standard installation for basic and expanded Cable Service to each and every floor of every City building within its Franchise area in existence on the date hereof that is passed by the Cable System in the Franchise area that is within one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet of the existing Cable System and to which the Franchisee has access. A Franchisee shall charge no more than its time and material costs for the installation of any additional Cable Service outlets to such facilities. Service shall be provided to new or additional government facilities during the term of this Agreement upon reasonable notice. 
6.  A Cable System shall include an "emergency alert" capability, which shall allow the City or other appropriate government body in an emergency, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to interrupt Cable Service, remotely override the audio of all Channels on the Cable System, or to allow for video crawl over all Channels consistent with FCC rules regarding access to emergency information for persons with hearing or vision disabilities. 
7.  Standard installation shall consist of a drop not exceeding one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from the cable plant to the nearest entry point of a subscriber's residence. Residential drops in excess of one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet may be charged according to Franchisee's published rate schedule. 
8.  The City may seek the use of a portion of the Cable System's bandwidth for collecting data for purposes including, but not limited to, a fire, police or other alarm system, or reading water meters pursuant to a separate agreement with the Franchisee, provided that Franchisee shall not be obligated to negotiate an agreement with the City for use of the system where capacity does not exist, in instances where the lease of capacity is not technically or economically feasible, or if the use of such system by the City is for services that are in competition with services offered or to be offered by the Franchisee. 
9.  The Cable System operator shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby powering for headend transportation and trunk amplifiers for a minimum of two (2) hours. The equipment shall be constructed to automatically notify the cable office when it is in operation and to automatically revert to the standby mode when the AC power returns. All utility safety regulations must be followed to prevent a standby generator from powering the "dead" utility line, with possible injury to an unwitting lineperson. 
b.  Most Favored Nation. Pursuant to the requirements of an initial or renewal Franchise agreement granted pursuant to Chapter XXII, or as otherwise agreed to pursuant to an agreement between the City and a Franchisee, a Franchisee shall provide, at a minimum, no less than the same highest level of cable facilities and services to subscribers in the City as are available on any system serving subscribers in Miami-Dade County, Florida, that is owned and operated by the Franchisee, its parent affiliate or subsidiary. Failure to comply with this Section shall result in the imposition of liquidated damages in an amount no less than three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars per day for each day the violation continues. 
c.  Conditions of Service. Upon request and payment of all applicable charges and provided that the requesting Person grants the Franchisee access to that Person's premises in order to furnish, maintain and continue to offer Cable Service to that Person, a Franchisee shall, throughout the term of a Franchise, offer any Person at that Person's place of residence or place of business within the existing Franchise area as of the date of this ordinance, [1] all Cable Services distributed over the Cable System, subject to the installation charges set forth in paragraph (a)(7) above, provided that such dwelling is in an area of density of at least twenty-five (25) dwelling units per required cable mile, and except as otherwise set forth in a Franchise agreement. If the City annexes any new areas after the date of this ordinance,* Franchisee shall be required to provide Cable Service at standard installation rates to such area subject to this Ordinance and any Franchise granted hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a Franchisee shall not be required to provide service to any area already served by a Franchised cable operator. 
d.  Upon Franchisee's acquisition of facilities in any City right-of-way, or upon the annexation to the City of any area in which Franchisee owns or operates any facility, Franchisee shall, at the City's request, submit to the City a statement describing all facilities involved, whether authorized by Franchise, permit, Franchise or other prior right, and specifying the location of all such facilities to the extent Franchisee has possession of such information. Such facilities shall immediately be subject to this ordinance and the terms of Franchisee's Franchise granted hereunder provided that a reasonable period of time shall be afforded Franchisee for integrating facilities. 
e.  Upon request, as part of an initial or renewal Franchise proposal, which renewal proposal shall be subject to the criteria of Section 626 of the Cable Act with respect to assessment of community needs, Franchisee shall, at the City's request, submit to the City a proposal to provide an Institutional Network ("I-Net") to the City taking into consideration the interconnection of all government and other public buildings as designated by the City. A Franchisee may provide the City, subject to City approval, with an equivalent of an I-NET, based on current technology, or a capital grant in lieu of all or part of the obligations set forth herein in order to satisfy the community's needs and interests. 
f.  Where an I-NET already exists in the City, an Applicant for an initial or renewal Franchise shall provide the City with a capital grant in lieu of an Institutional Network, or other cable proposal as City may require.

22-16 - FRANCHISE FEE. 
a.  As of the date of this Ordinance, [2] the State of Florida Simplified Communications Service Tax, F.S., Ch. 202, prohibits the obligations imposed on Franchisee in this Section and this Section 22-16 is severable from this chapter and has no effect on the remaining valid portions of this ordinance. However, if State or Federal Law allows the City to impose the requirements of this section, the City expressly reserves the right to do so. 
b.  Unless prohibited by applicable law, a Franchisee, as compensation for the privilege granted under a Franchise for the use of the public rights-of-way to construct and operate a Cable System to provide Cable Services in the City, shall pay to the City a Franchise fee in an amount up to a maximum of either (1) five (5%) percent of the Franchisee's gross revenues derived directly or indirectly from the operation of its Cable System within the City during the term of its Franchise pursuant to Section 22-1 hereof; or (2) if the Cable Act or other applicable law is amended to allow the City to assess a Franchise fee of a greater amount than that specified in (1) above, the Franchisee agrees to pay to the City the new amount after a public hearing in which the public and Franchisee are given an opportunity to comment on the impact of the higher fee. In no event shall a Franchisee pay a Franchise Fee greater than the maximum permitted by applicable law. 
c.  Unless prohibited by applicable law, a Franchisee shall pay the Franchise fee due to the City on a quarterly basis. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the City not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter. 
d.  Unless prohibited by applicable law, a Franchisee shall file with the City, on a quarterly basis with the payment of the Franchise fee, a financial statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate the Franchise fee for the preceding quarter and a detailed explanation of the method of computation. A certified public accountant or a duly authorized officer of the Franchisee shall certify the statement. The Franchisee shall bear the cost of the preparation of such financial statements. 
e.  Subject to applicable law, no acceptance by the City of any Franchise fee payment shall be construed, as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable. 
f.  Unless prohibited by applicable law, the City may, from time to time, and upon reasonable notice, inspect and audit any and all books and records of the Franchisee relevant to the determination of gross revenues and the computation of Franchise fees due, and may re-compute any amounts determined to be payable under the Franchise, subject to the applicable statute of limitations. If, as a result of the audit, the City determines that the Franchisee has underpaid the quarterly Franchise fees owed in an amount equal to or exceeding three (3%) percent of the Franchise fees actually paid based on components of gross revenues as specifically defined herein, the cost of the audit shall be paid by the Franchisee to the City within forty-five (45) days of receipt of demand for payment, unless Franchisee can show the audit is materially incorrect. A Franchisee shall make all books and records necessary to satisfactorily perform the audit readily available to the auditors in the County, for inspection and copying, or in the alternative, Franchisee shall pay all incremental costs and fees incurred by the City for the City to perform the audit at a location outside of the County. A Franchisee shall provide for inspection any and all materials within thirty (30) days of receipt of a request from the City. 
g.  If a Franchise fee payment is not received by the City on or before the due date set forth in Subsection c. above, or is underpaid, the Franchisee shall pay a late charge of eighteen (18%) percent per annum of the amount of the unpaid or underpaid Franchise fee payment; provided, however, that such rate does not exceed the maximum amount allowed under Florida law. Any such failure to remit payment on a timely basis, after written notice and failure to cure, shall be considered a material violation of Chapter XXII and any Franchise granted pursuant hereto. Any interest and/or late charges paid by Franchisee is intended to be a charge incidental to the enforcing of a Franchise within the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(D) of the to Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 542 (g)(2)(D), and may not be deducted from the Franchise fee imposed by Chapter XXII or any Franchise agreement nor passed through to subscribers. 
h.  Unless prohibited by law, when a Franchise terminates for any reason, the Franchisee shall file with the City within ninety (90) days of the date its operations in the City cease, a financial statement, certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Franchisee, showing the gross revenues received by the Franchisee since the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjustments shall be made at that time for Franchise fees due up to and including the date that the Franchisee's operations ceased.

h.  Disconnection. 
1.  Voluntary Disconnection. 
(a)  A subscriber may terminate service at any time. 
(b)  A Franchisee shall promptly disconnect any subscriber who so requests from the Cable System of the Franchisee. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination of service may be required of subscribers by any Franchisee.

After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the Franchisee shall promptly reinstate service. Franchisee reserves the right to deny service to any customer who has been repeatedly disconnected for non-payment of services to the extent such rights are consistent with applicable State and Federal law. 
3.  Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the Franchisee from removing its property from a premises of a subscriber upon the termination of service consistent with FCC rules and regulations and any other applicable law. At the request of a subscriber, a Franchisee shall remove all of its facilities and equipment from the premises of the subscriber within thirty (30) calendar days of the request. Where removal is impractical, such as with buried cable or internal wiring, facilities and equipment may be disconnected and abandoned rather than removed, unless there is a written agreement stating otherwise, provided however, that such agreement must be consistent with applicable law and FCC rules. 
i.  Franchisee shall intentionally interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Franchisee shall use its best efforts to insure that scheduled interruptions shall occur where possible during the hours of 12:01 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., except during a rebuild or upgrading of the Cable System. Franchisee shall maintain a written log for all intentional service interruptions.

A Franchisee shall develop written procedures for the investigation and resolution of all subscriber or City resident complaints, including, but not limited to, those regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunction and security deposits, which procedures shall be provided to the City Manager. A subscriber or City resident who has not been satisfied by following the procedures of the Franchisee may file a written complaint with the office of the City Manager, who will investigate the matter and, in consultation with the Franchisee as appropriate, attempt to resolve the matter. The good faith or lack thereof of the Franchisee in attempting to resolve subscriber and resident complaints in a fair and equitable manner will be considered in connection with the renewal Application of the Franchisee. Franchisee shall maintain a complete list of all complaints received during the prior twelve (12) months, requiring a service call not resolved within seven (7) calendar days of receipt and the measures taken to resolve those complaints. This list shall be provided to the City upon request. It shall be compiled on a quarterly basis. 
m.  Upon reasonable request by the City, Franchisee shall permit the City designee to inspect and test the technical equipment and facilities of the system upon reasonable notice not to be less than forty-eight (48) hours. 
n.  The City, or its designated representatives, shall have the right to evaluate and/or audit the customer service call centers upon reasonable notice not to be less than forty-eight (48) hours.

(i)  The information of the Franchisee's collection, and disclosure policies for the protection of the privacy of the subscriber. 
2.  To the extent a Franchisee's billing system allows, each Franchisee shall provide written notice in its monthly billing, at the request of the City, of any City meeting regarding requests or Applications by the Franchisee for renewal, transfer or modification of its license or change in service, rates or charges to subscribers unless such written notification takes place by separate mailing or other means. The City shall make such a request in writing, no less than forty-five (45) days prior to the mailing of any billing by Franchisee, such that Franchisee's regular billing cycle shall not be interrupted. Said notices shall be made at the expense of the Franchisee for the first time only and said expense shall not be considered part of the Franchise fee assessed pursuant to the City's Cable Ordinance ("Ordinance") and shall not be regarded as a Franchise fee, as the term is defined in Section 622 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 542. 
3.  Franchisee bills will be clear, concise and understandable.

Except in the case of a system malfunction, not within the control of the cable operator, or except during a rebuild or upgrading of the Cable System, upon a Subscriber's request, a Franchisee shall provide a pro-rated 24-hour credit to the account of the subscriber for any period of four (4) hours or more within a 24-hour period during which a subscriber experienced an outage of service or substantial impairment of service. 
q.  Billing. 
1.  The first billing statement of the Franchisee after a new installation or service change shall be pro-rated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
2.  The billing statement of the Franchisee must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to tier of service charges and equipment charges. Invoices will also clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates and credits. 
3.  The billing statement of the Franchisee must show a specific due date not earlier than ten (10) days after the date of the beginning of the service period.

In cases where requests for service have been ignored or in cases where the service provided is alleged to be in non-compliance with this ordinance or a Franchise agreement, the City Manager or his designee shall have the power to require the Franchisee to provide service consistent with the terms of the Franchise, if in the opinion of the City Manager or his designee such request for service is reasonable. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the City Manager, including the Franchisee, may appeal the matter to the City Council for hearing and determination. The City Council may accept, reject or modify the decision of the City Manager. No adjustment, settlement, or compromise, whether instituted by the City Manager or by the City Council, shall be contrary to the provisions of the Ordinance, any Franchise issued pursuant to the Ordinance or this Agreement, and neither the City Manager nor the City Council, in the adjustment, settlement, or compromise of any controversy shall have the right or authority to add to, modify or delete any provision of the Ordinance or of the Franchise or this Agreement, or to interfere with any rights of subscribers or any Franchisee under applicable Federal, or State law or private contract.

2.  Prior to assessing a fine, the City Manager or his designee shall mail to the Franchisee a written notice by certified or registered mail of the proposed refund and/or fine, specifying the violation at issue. The Franchisee shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the written notice to cure or commence to cure the alleged violation and to file a written response to the notice of the City Manager or his designee. A written response from the Franchisee shall be signed by a management level employee of Franchisee and all statements contained therein will be regarded as material representations to the City. 
3.  Prior to assessing a fine, the City Manager or his designee shall consider any justification or mitigating factor advanced in the written response of the Franchisee, including but not limited to rebates or credits to the Subscriber or a cure or commencement of a cure of the violation. The City Manager, after consideration of the response of the Franchisee, may not assess any fine, if the Franchisee has cured or commenced to cure the violation within a reasonable time frame. The City Manager may, after consideration of the response of the Franchisee, waive or reduce any proposed refund or fine. 
4.  Subsequent to the notice of proposed fine to Franchisee and consideration of the response of the Franchisee, if any, the City may, after a public hearing at which Franchisee shall have an opportunity be heard, issue an assessment of fine. Any fine will commence as of the date of the written notice specifying the violation at issue. The fine shall be paid within thirty (30) days of written notice of assessment to the Franchisee, or if Franchisee challenges the assessment in a court of competent jurisdiction, within thirty (30) days of a final non-appealable decision that the assessment is valid. This fine shall constitute liquidated damages to the City for the violation and the City may enforce payment of the refund or fine in any court having jurisdiction. It is the intent of the City to determine fines as a reasonable estimate of the damages suffered by the City and/or its subscribers, whether actual or potential, and may include without limitation, increased costs of administration and other damages difficult to measure. 
5.  Franchisee may submit an appeal regarding any decision of the City Manager directly to the City Council within thirty (30) days of notice of the decision to the Franchisee. Such appeal shall be made in writing and submitted by certified mail.

y.  In addition to complying with the customer service standards set forth in this ordinance or in any Franchise issued pursuant to this ordinance, a Franchisee shall comply with all customer service standards of the FCC applicable to Cable Systems of the FCC and any other applicable Federal, State or County law concerning customer service standards, consumer protection, and unfair or deceptive trade practices. 
z.  The City expressly reserves the right to consider violations of the customer service requirements in evaluating any renewal, modification or transfers of any Franchise. 
aa.  Subscriber Privacy. 
1.  A Franchisee shall at all times protect the privacy of all Subscribers to the full extent required by Section 631 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. 551, and State law. A Franchisee shall not condition Subscriber or other service on the grant of permission of the Subscriber to disclose information which, pursuant to Federal or State law, cannot be disclosed without the explicit consent of the Subscriber. No penalties or extra charges may be invoked by the Franchisee for a failure of the Subscriber to grant consent. 
2.  Unless otherwise permitted by Federal or State law, neither the Franchisee nor its agents or employees shall, without the prior and specific written authorization of the Subscriber involved, sell, or otherwise make available for commercial purposes the names, addresses or telephone numbers of any Subscriber or Subscribers, or any information which identifies the individual viewing habits of any Subscriber or Subscribers. 
bb.  Where technically and economically feasible, all data and information required by this chapter to be provided to the City by Franchisee shall reflect only the operations of the Cable System within the City. 
cc.  In the event that Franchisee intends to pass through to subscribers any additional costs arising from the customer service standards set forth in Chapter XXII herein or in any Franchise granted pursuant hereto, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 922 (e)(2)(ii) the Franchisee must provide at least sixty (60) days prior written notice. In the event Franchisee provides such notice to the City, the City Manager may suspend any customer service standard for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days to allow for the City to consider Franchisees showing and to allow the City to consider any modifications of the customer service standards that may be deemed appropriate by the City.

22-19 - DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED. 
a.  No Franchisee may in its rates or charges, or in the availability of the services or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, make or grant any illegal undue preferences or advantages to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers, nor subject any such person or group of people to any undue prejudice or any disadvantage. A Franchisee shall not deny, delay or otherwise burden service or discriminate against subscribers or users on the basis of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, marital status or political affiliation, except for discounts for senior citizens, the economically disadvantaged or disabled that, if applied, are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.

f.  A Franchisee shall upon notice to the City of not less than seven (7) days, emergency situations excepted, have the authority to trim the trees or other natural growth upon and overhanging the streets so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires, cables and other equipment of the Franchisee, except that, at the option of the City, such trimming may be done under its supervision. 
g.  A Franchisee shall use, with the permission of the owner, existing underground conduits (if applicable) or overhead utility facilities whenever and, wherever feasible and if available on reasonable terms and conditions, provided that nothing herein shall constitute a waiver of Franchisee's obligations under the Code. Upon request, copies of agreements between a Franchisee and third party for use of conduits or other facilities shall be filed with the City, provided that the Franchisee shall have the right to redact proprietary and confidential information in such agreements as it pertains to financial arrangements between the parties, consistent with State law. 
h.  It is the City's intent that all utility providers' wires, cable lines, and other transmission lines, equipment and structures should be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights of property owners. The City may issue such rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of utility facilities installed in, on, or over the Streets, as may be consistent with State law, the City's Rights-of-Way Ordinance, this ordinance and the Franchise agreement 
i.  All safety practices required by law shall be used during construction, maintenance and repair of a Cable System. A Franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment or fixtures where any lawfully pre-existing gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer or other utility facilities shall interfere, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents of the City. 
j.  A Franchisee shall at all times: 
1.  Install and maintain its wires, cables, fixtures and other equipment in an orderly and workmanlike manner and according to the Federal, State, County and City laws, rules and regulations and the Florida Building Code and other technical codes lawfully adopted by the City, and in such a manner that the City installations will not receive interference. 
2.  Keep and maintain in a safe, suitable, substantial condition, and in good order and repair, all structures, lines, equipment, and connections in, over, under, and upon the City streets, sidewalks, alleys, and public ways or places, wherever situated or located. 
k.  On streets where both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground, either at the time of initial construction of a Cable System or at any time thereafter, the cable of a Franchisee shall also be located underground at the Franchisee's expense. Between a street and a residence of a subscriber, the cable of the Franchisee must be located underground if both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground. The City shall encourage, to the extent feasible, that the public utility and the Franchisee cooperate in opening of trenches and making such trenches available to all parties with the understanding that the costs of opening and refilling of such trenches would be shared equally by all users of such trenches. 
l.  If the use of any part of a Cable System is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of six (6) months, or if such system or property has been installed in any street without complying with the requirements of Chapter XXII or Franchise agreement, or the Franchise has been terminated canceled or expired, the Franchisee, within thirty (30) days after written notice by the City, shall commence removal from the streets of all such property as the City may require. 
m.  The City may extend the time for the removal of equipment of the Franchisee and facilities for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, and thereafter such equipment and facilities may be deemed abandoned. 
n.  If such removal or abandonment occurs, the Franchisee shall restore the area to as good a condition as prior to such removal or abandonment. 
o.  All Franchisee Cable System distribution devices to be located on streets or private property shall be installed, pursuant to the Code, in such a way as to eliminate or minimize any potentially adverse impact. Proposed locations may require review and approval by the City. 
p.  In no case shall distribution devices be placed in the following locations provided alternate sites exist capable of providing for the distribution of quality services, equivalent in quality to other areas of the City: 
1.  Within Scenic Transportation Corridors. 
2.  Within Historical Preservation Districts. 
3.  Within a specified 25-foot corner visibility triangle.

q.  The City may require that these distribution devices located on streets and private property be installed with the following: 
1.  Landscaping. 
2.  Visual screening. 
3.  Fencing, barriers, or other security features. When required, the Franchisee shall ensure that all landscaping, visual screening, fencing, barriers or other security features are compatible with the characteristics of the surrounding landscape and architectural features and require minimal maintenance. The City shall not unreasonably require landscaping, visual screening, fencing, barriers, or other security features that are inconsistent with the character of the immediate area in which the distribution devices are to be installed. Recognizing that even minimal landscaping, visual screening, fencing, barriers or other security features may be susceptible to overgrowth, disease, decay and disrepair, the City shall require the Franchisee to maintain and/or repair/replace this landscaping, visual screening, fencing, barriers, or other security features. 
r.  Placement of distribution devices on private property shall conform to all code requirements, rules and regulations. 
s.  The Franchisee's use of City private property for the placement or attachment of equipment used in the provision of Cable Services [for example, generators, power supply units and concrete environmental closures (CEC)] shall be according to City policies and procedures.

a.  Upon completion of the review and evaluation process set forth in Section 626(a)(I)(2) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546, should that process be invoked, the City shall notify the Franchisee, by certified or registered mail that it may file a formal renewal Application in the form of a renewal proposal. The notice shall specify the minimum information to be included in the renewal Application and the deadline for filing the Application, which shall be no earlier than thirty (30) days following the date of the notice. 
1.  The Application shall comply with the requirements of applicable renewal subsections as set forth in Section 22-8 hereof to the extent applicable to Franchise renewals and provide the specific information requested in the notice. If the Franchisee does not submit a formal renewal Application by the date specified in the notice, which shall in no event be less than one hundred twenty (120) days, to the Franchisee by the City, given pursuant to this subsection, the City may take such action as appropriate under law. 
2.  Upon receipt of the formal renewal Application, the City shall publish notice of its receipt and make copies available to the public. The City, following public notice of no less than ten (10) days, may hold one (1) or more public hearings on the renewal Application. 
b.  After the public hearing(s) on the renewal Application is held, the City Council may either award a Franchise pursuant to a request for proposal, and thereby renew the Franchise; or only after a public hearing, properly noticed, pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that sets forth the grounds that the Franchise should not be renewed. 
c.  If a preliminary assessment is made that a Franchise should not be renewed, at the request of the Franchisee or on its own initiative, the City shall commence a proceeding according to Section 626(c) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c) to address the issues set forth in Section 626(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(l)(A)-(D). Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with 47 U.S.C. § 546(b) shall be based on one (1) or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1)(A)-(D), pursuant to the record of proceedings under 47 U.S.C. § 546(c). The City shall not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the Franchise under § 546(c)(I)(A) or on events considered under § 546(c)(I)(B) unless the City has provided the Franchisee with notice and opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the City has waived its right to object, or the Franchisee gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the City fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice. 
d.  Any request to initiate a renewal process or proposal for renewal not submitted within the time period set forth in Section 626(a) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(a), or submitted within such time frame and the parties agree that the informal process shall be first initiated, shall be deemed an informal proposal for renewal and shall be governed according to Section 626(h) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(h). The City may hold one (1) or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an informal proposal for renewal may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the City Council shall determine whether the Franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions of any renewal. 
e.  If the City Council grants a renewal Application, the City and the Franchisee shall agree on the terms of a Franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 22-9 hereof, before such renewal becomes effective. 
f.  If renewal of a Franchise is lawfully denied, the City may acquire ownership of the Cable System or affect a transfer of ownership of the system to another person upon approval of the City Council pursuant to Section 547 of the Communications Act. The City may not acquire ownership of the system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system while an appeal of a denial for renewal is pending in any court pursuant to the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(e). 
g.  If renewal of a Franchise is lawfully denied and no appeal to a court is pending, and the City does not purchase the Cable System or approve or affect a transfer of the Cable System to another person, the City may require the former Franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the expense of the former Franchisee. If the former Franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the City may have the removal completed at the expense of the former Franchisee and/or surety. 
(Ord. No. 2004-2 § 21, 3-16-04) 
22-22 - TRANSFER, SALE AND ASSIGNMENT. 
a.  No transfer, sale or assignment of any interest in a Franchise shall occur without prior City approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
b.  An Application for a transfer, sale or assignment of any interest of a Franchise shall meet the requirements of Section 22-8 hereof, and provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including, but not limited to, details on the legal, financial, technical and other material and lawful qualifications of the Transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber service. Except in the case of a pro forma transfer as defined in Section 22-1, the Application shall provide, at a minimum, the information required in subsection 22-8e.1-3, and 16, or such other information as is specified in a Franchise agreement in lieu of the information required in Section 22-8. Upon written request, the Applicant shall provide to the City as additional information any and all written information provided to the County in connection with the transfer if such information is relevant to the City. The City hereby reserves the right to request such additional information as it may reasonably require to consider the Application, however, such requests shall not have the effect of tolling the one hundred twenty (120) day automatic approval period provided by Federal law. 
c.  The Application process shall not include any pro forma transfers, as defined herein, mortgages and pledges of Franchisee's securities, but shall require proper notice to the City pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance or the Franchise Agreement. 
d.  In making a determination on whether to grant an Application for a transfer of a Franchise, the City Council shall consider the legal, financial, technical and material and lawful other qualifications of the Transferee to operate the system; and whether the incumbent cable operator, who is transferring its Franchise to another operator, is in substantial compliance with the material terms of its Franchise agreement and Chapter XXII and, if not, the proposed commitment of the Transferee to cure such noncompliance and whether operation by the Transferee would adversely affect Cable Services to subscribers. The City Council shall not unreasonably withhold approval to any such transfer. 
e.  No Franchise transfer Application shall be granted unless the Transferee, if the Franchise holder, agrees in writing to abide by and accept all terms of Chapter XXII and Franchise agreement, and to assume all obligations and liabilities of the previous Franchisee, whether known or unknown, under Chapter XXII and Franchise agreement. If such Transferee will not be the holder of the Franchise, such Transferee will sign an acknowledgment ensuring compliance by the Franchisee with the Franchise agreement and Chapter XXII. The City shall certify to Franchisee, upon request, all issues of Franchisee's performance that are known and pending. 
f.  Subject to applicable law, approval by the City of a transfer of a Franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the City under Chapter XXII or the Franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer.

22-23 - REVOCATION OR TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.

c.  Notwithstanding subsections a. and b. hereof, any Franchise may, at the option of the City following a public hearing before the City Council, be revoked one hundred twenty (120) days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the Franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that one hundred twenty (120) day period: 
1.  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or

ARTICLE I. - INTRODUCTION AND PENALTIES 

Sec. 24-1 - Title. 
    This Code shall be known and may be cited by the title of "North Miami Beach Zoning and Land Development Code." 
Sec. 24-2 - Purpose and Intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this Code to provide land use planning and development criteria, standards and regulations to promote, protect and improve, in accordance with present and future needs, the public health, safety, comfort, good order, appearance, convenience, morals, law enforcement and fire protection and general welfare of the citizens and residents of North Miami Beach, Florida; to provide for orderly growth, development, and environmental protection; to provide a vehicle of coordination for all planning and development decisions with area, County, regional and state planning agencies and authorities; to prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate and efficient provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, recreational facilities, housing and other requirements and services. 
    It is further the purpose of this Code to conserve the value of land, buildings and resources; to protect the character and maintain the stability of residential, commercial and industrial areas; to provide for efficiency and economy in the process of development for the appropriate and best use of all land for preservation, protection, development and conservation of our natural resources of land, water and air; to provide for convenience of traffic and circulation of people and goods; to accommodate the healthful and convenient distribution of population; to encourage the provision of adequate public utilities and facilities; and to promote the civic amenities of beauty and visual interest. 
    To accomplish these goals and objectives, the regulations and standards have been designed with reasonable consideration to carry out the foregoing legislative purposes and intent in the best interest of all citizens and residents of North Miami Beach, Florida. 
    It is the expressed intent of the City in adopting this Code to implement the adopted Comprehensive Plan as mandated in the Local Government Comprehensive Planning Act of the State of Florida, and to that end this Code is based on, related to, consistent with, and a means of implementation for, said plan or elements thereof. 
Sec. 24-3 - Scope. 
    The provisions of this Code shall apply to all land, water, buildings and structures now or hereinafter located in the territorial limits of the City of North Miami Beach, Florida. 
Sec. 24-4 - Legal Effect. 
    This Code, together with the adopted Comprehensive Plan shall fully regulate and control all land development within the City, and no land development shall take place in the City except in conformity with the provisions of this Code, and this Code shall be enforced by any means provided by law or this Code. The issuance or granting of any permit or approval shall not be deemed or construed to be a permit for an approval of any violation of this Code, and the issuance of such a permit or approval shall not prevent the appropriate City official from thereafter requiring the correction of said permit or approval to bring them in full compliance with this Code. 
Sec. 24-5 - Conflict With Other Ordinances. 
    Where this Code may be in conflict with any other ordinances or resolutions, the provisions of this Code shall govern unless any existing ordinances or resolutions are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements and have not been expressly repealed, in which event those restrictions shall apply. 
Sec. 24-6 - Severability. 
    In the event that any section or provision of this Code or any portion thereof, any paragraph, sentence or word be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remainder hereof as a whole or part thereof other than the part declared to be invalid, unless specifically provided in this section. 
    Whenever any condition or limitation is included in an order authorizing a conditional use, variance, waiver, exception, approval, extension, or similar action, unless otherwise specifically provided in said order, it shall be conclusively presumed that the authorizing body or officer considered such condition or limitation necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this Code or the requirement of some provision hereof, and to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and that the officer or board would not have granted the authorization to which the condition or limitation pertains except in the belief that the condition or limitation was lawful, binding and enforceable, and if the imposition of such condition or limitation is declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the authorization is revoked. Wherever this Code provides for the granting of a conditional use, variance, waiver, exception, extension or similar action, subject to meeting certain standards, requirements and procedures set forth in this Code, it shall be conclusively presumed that such provision is nonseverable from the standards, requirements and procedures that pertain to it, and that such provision would not have been made a part of this Code except subject to said standards, requirements and procedures, and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall declare any of said standards, requirements or procedures to be invalid, such decision shall invalidate the provision to which said standards, requirements or procedures pertains. 
Sec. 24-7 - Penalties. 
    Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
    The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties herein provided. 
    Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

ARTICLE III. - DISTRICT RULES 

Sec. 24-30 - Establishment of Districts. 
    In order to classify, regulate, and restrict the use of land, water, buildings and structures, to regulate and restrict the height and bulk of buildings, to regulate the area of yards and other open spaces around and about buildings, to regulate the intensity of land use and to promote the orderly urban growth of North Miami Beach, the City is divided into a series of districts. 
Sec. 24-31 - Official Zoning Map. 
    The boundaries of each district are designated and established as shown on the official zoning map of the City, as that map may be adopted and amended from time to time. 
    The official zoning map of the City shall consist of a map or series of maps, which may be prepared and adopted separately or cumulatively by the City Council. 
    The official zoning map shall be kept on public display in the Community Development Department, and said official zoning map, as amended from time to time, shall be a part of and incorporated in this Zoning Code. 
    No changes or amendments to the official zoning map shall be made except in compliance and conformity with this Code, and any such changes shall be made promptly after official adoption of the amendment. 
    The official zoning map approved and adopted by the City Council on June 17, 1980, and as amended from time to time, shall be the initial zoning map of the City. 
Sec. 24-32 - Rules for Interpretation. 
(A)  Location of District Boundary Lines. When uncertainty exists as to boundaries of the districts on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Center lines: Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, highways and alleys shall be construed to follow such lines. 
(2)  Lot lines: Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
(3)  Municipal boundaries: Boundaries indicated as approximately following municipal boundaries shall be construed as following such municipal boundaries. 
(4)  Railroad lines: Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be the center line of the railroad right-of-way. 
(5)  Water lines: Boundaries indicated as following water lines shall be construed to follow such water lines. 
(6)  Parallel lines: Boundaries that are approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets, the center lines or alley lines of alleys, or the center line or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning maps. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning maps. 
(7)  Bisecting lines: Boundaries that approximately bisect a block, lot or tract shall be construed to follow the median lines of such blocks, as indicated by rear property lines or as measured between the center lines of boundary streets in the absence of rear property lines or in the absence of both of the above by use of the scale appearing on the zoning maps. 
(8)  Uncertainties: Where features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in case any other uncertainty exists, the City Council shall interpret the intent of the official zoning map as to the location of district boundaries. 
(9)  Street abandonments: Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned street or alley. 
(10)  Excluded areas: Where parcels of land have been inadvertently excluded from a zoning district classification in any manner, said parcels shall be classified as RS-1 until rezoned. 
(B)  When use district regulations specifically incorporate the permitted uses of another use district, those permitted uses shall be subject to the requirements of the incorporating district, unless otherwise specified. 
(C)  Where a permitted use is first specified in a use district, that use may only be permitted in that district and any district incorporating its permitted uses. 
(D)  Unless otherwise specified, all height regulations shall be measured from the finished grade, as that term is defined in the Florida Building Code. 
Sec. 24-33 - Limits on Development in Residential Districts. 
    Development of residentially zoned or used property shall not exceed the maximum allowable residential density or building height set out in the North Miami Beach Comprehensive Plan or City Code applicable to that property in effect on August 1, 2008, whichever provisions are most restrictive. This provision shall not apply to the following zoning districts as shown on the City's zoning map as of the date this ordinance is approved: single-family zoning districts, zoning districts which do not list residential as a permitted use, and existing Planned Unit Development zoning districts. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, 12/18/07; Ord. No. 2008-13 § 2, 8/5/08) 
ARTICLE IV. - NONCONFORMITY 

Sec. 24-34 - Nonconforming Lots, Structures, Uses, Characteristics of Use and Combinations Thereof. 
(A)  Purpose and Intent. 
(1)  It is the purpose and intent of this section to permit the continuation of those lots, structures, uses, characteristics of use or combinations thereof, which were lawful prior to the passage of this Code but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Code or future amendments thereto. For purposes of this Code, a nonconforming lot, structure, use or characteristic of use is defined as a lot, structure, use, or combination thereof that does not comply with the use or site development standards of the zoning district in which the lot, structure, use or characteristic of use or combination thereof is located, but which was legally established and in existence before the effective date of this Code. 
(2)  This section is designed to provide reasonable and equitable standards and guidelines for the control of nonconforming lots, structures, uses and characteristics of uses in the regulation of change of use, change in kind or quality of use, change in volume or intensity of use, change in location of use, change of ownership or tenancy of use, accessory or incidental uses to nonconforming lots, structures, uses, or characteristics of uses, enlargement of use, replacement of use, addition or expansion of facilities, new activities, products or services connected with the nonconforming lot, structure, or use, the alteration of a nonconforming structure, repair of a nonconforming structure, restoration of a nonconforming structure, and abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming structure, and abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming structure or use, or any combination thereof. 
(3)  It is the further purpose and intent of this section to allow nonconforming lots, structures, uses, and characteristics of use and combinations thereof to continue, subject to specific conditions, in order not to interfere with the existing circumstances surrounding land development within the City of North Miami Beach prior to the effective date of this Code more than is necessary for the proper exercise of police powers relating to the general public welfare of the residents of the City of North Miami Beach. 
(B)  Nonconforming Classifications. Within the zoning districts established by this Code, or amendments that may be later adopted to this Code, there may exist: 
(1)  Nonconforming lots; 
(2)  Nonconforming structures; 
(3)  Nonconforming uses; 
(4)  Nonconforming characteristics of use; 
(5)  Combinations of nonconforming lots, nonconforming structures, nonconforming uses and nonconforming characteristics of use. 
    These nonconforming classifications are declared by this section to be incompatible with present permitted uses and all or part of the site development standards regulating permitted uses in the zoning district in which the nonconforming classifications are located and, therefore, are the proper subject regulation as provided for herein. 
(C)  Scope. In order to avoid undue hardship, nothing in this section shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure on which actual construction was lawfully done prior to the effective date of adoption of this Code and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. 
    For the purposes of this section, the term "actual construction" is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner according to approved plans for the specific improvement. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing structure has been substantially begun, preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction; provided, however, that work has been and shall be carried on diligently pursuant to a valid building permit. 
(D)  Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on a single lot, tract, or parcel of land of record at the effective date of adoption of this Code, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this section. 
    Such lots must be in separate ownership and not be of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area, width or depth, that are applicable in the zoning district in which the lot, parcel, or tract is located; provided, however, that required yard or area dimensions and requirements other than those site development standards applying to area, width, or depth shall conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such lot is located. 
    If two (2) or more lots, or combinations of lots, or portions of lots with continuous frontage and single ownership are of record at the time of the passage of this Code, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot areas, width or depth, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes the degree of compliance with established lot width, area and depth requirements. 
(E)  Nonconforming Uses of Land. The lawful use of land existing at the time of the passage of this Code or an amendment thereto, although such use does not conform to provisions of this Code may be continued subject to the following limitations and restrictions: 
(1)  Change in location of use: No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption of this Code. 
(2)  Change of ownership or tenancy: All rights and obligations associated with a nonconforming use of land run with the land and are not personal to the present owner or tenant of the nonconforming use of land and are not affected by a change in ownership or tenancy, except if abandoned. 
(3)  Accessory uses: Uses, accessory to a nonconforming use, not in existence at the time of the effective date of adoption of this Code, are not permitted. 
(4)  Change to a more restrictive category of use: A nonconforming use may be changed to a more restrictive category of nonconforming use if the resulting change reduces the degree of the nonconformity with applicable site development standards and use regulations. For the purpose of this section, a more restrictive category shall be a use or site development standard contained within a more restrictive zoning district. 
(5)  Expansion or extension of use: No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, expanded, extended or intensified beyond what existed at the time it became nonconforming. 
(6)  Replacement of use: In the event that any existing nonconforming use as provided for in this article is destroyed by more than fifty (50%) percent of its assessed value at the time of destruction as determined by the official records of the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser, such use shall not be replaced. The destruction may be by any means, including fire, flood, wind, explosion, act of God, or act of a public enemy. (Ord. No. 2002-22, 11/19/02) 
If such nonconforming use is destroyed to a level less than fifty (50%) percent of its total assessed value at the time of destruction as determined by the official records of the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser, it may be replaced, except that replacement can only occur in compliance with those building, plumbing, electrical, gas, fire, and other construction and safety related regulations in effect at the time of application for a permit to allow replacement. In no event shall the destroyed nonconforming use be replaced to a degree or level greater than the original use as to height, lot coverage, total floor area, bulk, or yard setback requirements. The Florida Building Code shall be used in the administration of this section. (Ord. No. 2002-22, 11/19/02) 
(7)  Abandonment or discontinuance of use: The abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, shall render the nonconforming use status of the specific nonconforming use null and void. In the factual determination of whether a nonconforming use has been abandoned or discontinued, the following factors shall be used, but not be limited to: 
(a)  An intent to discontinue the nonconforming use through removal of stock in trade or removal of operating equipment. 
(b)  Some overt act or failure to act which carries with it a sufficient implication that the owner neither claims nor retains any interest in the abandoned property as it stood before the abandonment has occurred. The mere renewal and maintenance of an active business tax receipt, without more, shall not constitute continuance of a nonconforming use. 
(F)  Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code, and it could not be built under the terms of this Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, or other site development standards concerning the structure, such structure, except as otherwise specifically provided, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Alteration, enlargement, or expansion of nonconforming structure: No such alteration, enlargement, or expansion of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted in a way which increases its noncompliance with present property development and use standards of the zoning district in which it is located, but any nonconforming structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its noncompliance with present site development and use standards of the zoning district in which it is located. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Director from ordering the compliance with all applicable Building Construction and Safety Related Codes. 
(2)  Replacement, restoration and reconstruction of nonconforming structure: In the event that any existing nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means, including fire, flood, wind, explosion, act of God, or act of a public enemy by less than fifty (50%) percent of its total appraised value according to the latest records of the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser, such structure shall be permitted to be replaced, restored, or reconstructed according to the site development standards in effect at the time of its original construction except that replacement, restoration and reconstruction can only occur in compliance with all applicable building, plumbing, electrical, gas, fire and other construction and safety related regulations in effect at the time of application for a permit to allow replacement, restoration, or reconstruction. In no event shall the destroyed nonconforming structure be replaced to a degree or level greater than the original structure as to height, lot coverage, floor area, yard setbacks or other applicable site development standards at the time of original construction. 
(3)  Repairs and maintenance of nonconforming structures: Routine repairs and maintenance of nonconforming structures on fixtures, wiring or plumbing shall be permitted. 
(4)  Change in location of nonconforming structure: Should any nonconforming structure be moved for any reason to any distance whatsoever from its original permitted location, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(5)  Accessory structures: Structures normally accessory or incidental to a permitted structure or use in the zoning district in which the nonconforming structure is located may be permitted as accessory structures to the nonconforming structure. 
(6)  Abandonment or discontinuance of nonconforming structure: The abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming structure for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, shall render the nonconforming structure status of the specific nonconforming structure null and void. 
(G)  Nonconforming Characteristics of Use. Characteristics of use, such as but not limited to off-street parking, off-street loading, and landscaping requirements, shall be interpreted to be synonymous with a part of the nonconforming classification of uses and structures legally permitted and existing at the time of the passage of this Code or an amendment thereto, although such characteristics of use do not conform to the provisions of this Code. 
(H)  Nonconforming Lots, Structures, Uses and Characteristics of Use in Combination. If, on the effective date of this original 1980 Zoning Code or the 1990 amendments thereto, a lot of record, structure, use or characteristics of use of land, in any combination thereof, exists that would not be permitted under the terms of this Code, but was lawful at the time of its original existence, that use may be continued unless otherwise deemed abandoned or terminated. However, the limitations outlined in subsections (E) and (F) above shall also apply to all nonconforming lots of record, structures, uses and characteristics of use. 
(I)  Nonconforming Outdoor Uses. All primary and accessory outdoor uses which are nonconforming shall be discontinued within one (1) year of the final adoption of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22, 11/19/02; Ord. No. 2011-10 § 2, 9/6/11)

( Ord. No. 2015-5 , § 2(Exh. A), 3-17-15; Ord. No. 2018-6 , § 2, 5-24-18) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-5 , § 2(Exh. A), adopted March 17, 2015, repealed the former § 24-58, and enacted a new § 24-58 as set out herein. The former § 24-58 pertained to FCC Fulford City Center (Mixed-Use) District. 
Sec. 24-58.1 - Fulford Mixed-Use Town Center District (MU/TC). 
(A)  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these regulations is to implement policies that guide the design of development within the Fulford Mixed-Use Town Center District (MU/TC). The intent is to enable transit-oriented development that contributes to the creation of an urban downtown and the formation of a quality pedestrian-oriented, Mixed-use district. The objective is to shape development to create a "place," an exciting, enlivened social gathering point and a destination, which encourages the establishment of a wide mix of commercial and residential uses that offer the flexibility to meet a variety of market needs. The aim of these regulations is to create an environment that attracts day and evening activities so that the street is occupied by visitors, residents, business owners and operators who have a clear and vested interest in the vitality of the Fulford Mixed-Use Town Center District (MU/TC). This purpose will be fulfilled by: 
(1)  Ensuring high quality, architecturally compatible, consistently landscaped development throughout the District; 
(2)  Stimulating commercial and retail trade activities; 
(3)  Ensuring that new development or redevelopment projects enhance the visual character of the District; 
(4)  Encouraging the development of pleasant shopping areas with attractive pedestrian spaces; 
(5)  Encouraging people to reside in the District; 
(6)  Encouraging the beautification of the Snake Creek Canal greenway; and 
(7)  Encouraging public access to the waterfront. 
(B)  District Boundaries. The development standards shall be utilized for properties located within the Fulford Mixed-Use Town Center district (MU/TC). 
(C)  Administration. In order to maintain predictability in development, Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) shall be prohibited. Variances from the dimensional requirements or waivers from any other criterion may be approved by the applicable review board for projects, provided that the applicant meets the standards pertaining to such variance or waiver. The applicable board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Director of the Community Development Department or his/her designee in the enforcement of these development regulations. 
(D)  General Development Standards. 
(1)  In addition to the standards contained herein, Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district standards shall be applicable to development within the Fulford Mixed-Use Town Center district (MU/TC). The applicable regulations contained in Articles IV, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV shall also apply, except as modified herein and may be further modified by the City Manager or his/her designee to meet the purpose and intent of the Fulford City Center (Mixed-use) District. 
(2)  The provisions of the MU/TC code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the existing zoning and land development regulations. 
(3)  The provisions of the building code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the provisions of the MU/TC code. 
(4)  Existing buildings may be destroyed or removed, however they must be replaced according to the MU/TC regulations. Existing buildings may not be destroyed or removed unless they are to be replaced according to MU/TC regulations and only after a building permit is issued. 
(5)  Existing buildings and uses within the MU/TC area, which are legally established but do not conform to provisions of the MU/TC regulations as of the effective date of these regulations shall be considered nonconforming and may not be replaced, restored, or modified, except in conformity with the regulation for nonconformities contained in Article IV of this chapter. When a nonconforming structure is destroyed by windstorm, flood, or nature disaster, it may be replaced by a new structure of the same or lesser size, and reoccupied by the same use, if construction of such structure is commenced within eighteen (18) months of destruction. 
(6)  Proposed development with site plan approved under the 2002 FCC MUTC regulations shall commence construction within the time frame allotted in the development order or site plan approval letter. If commencement of construction does not occur within the allotted time frame, the site plan approval shall automatically expire without further action by the City. 
(E)  Regulating Plans and Diagrams. The MU/TC is governed by a series of regulating plans and diagrams. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams demonstrate MU/TC development standards in both words and diagrams, and include maps designating the locations where the various standards apply. Unless otherwise noted, all development shall be in compliance with the Regulating Plans and Diagrams contained herein and with the Building Typology and Placement Regulating Diagrams in Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams for the MU/TC include the following: 
(1)  The Sub-areas Regulating Plan, which divides the MU/TC into three (3) Sub-areas: Core, Transition and Edge. The highest density and intensity within the MU/TC shall be allocated to the Core Sub-area, a mixed-use area in the heart of the district. The densities and intensities shall then gradually decrease from the Core to the Transition Sub-area where mixed-uses are still permitted and then further decrease to the Edge Sub-area which is characterized by single uses, including low density residential adjacent to existing low density residential. The Sub-areas Regulating Plan is shown in Figure MU/TC-1. 
(2)  The Street Network Connectivity Regulating Plan, which shows the approximate location of existing and the required new streets needed to create the prescribed network of streets within the MU/TC. This Plan also establishes the hierarchy of the streets as shown in Figure MU/TC-2. 
(3)  The Designated Publically Accessible Open Spaces and Urban Greenway Systems Regulating Plan, which designates the approximate location of the required publically accessible open spaces and urban greenway system as shown in Figure MU/TC-3. 
(4)  The Building Heights Regulating Plan, which establishes the maximum building height as shown in Figure MU/TC-4.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-5 , § 2(Exh. A), adopted March 17, 2015, repealed the former § 24-58.1, and enacted a new § 24-58.1 as set out herein. The former § 24-58.1 pertained to purpose and intent, and derived from Ord. No. 2002-20, § 2, adopted Nov. 19, 2002; and Ord. No. 2008-4, § 2, adopted March 4, 2008. 
Sec. 24-58.2 - Mixed-Use Employment Center District (MU/EC). 
(A)  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these regulations is to implement policies that guide the design of development within the Mixed-Use Employment Center District (MU/EC). The intent is to enable economic development supportive of high technology and service-based activities that are compatible with residential uses. Limited auto-oriented uses are considered acceptable in this district but are required to be designed in a manner that encourages pedestrian and transit use. Mixed-use may be vertically or horizontally integrated based on compatibility and other factors. Stand-alone office park-style development as well as live-work buildings are equally appropriate in this district as are stand-alone residential buildings. This purpose will be fulfilled by: 
(1)  Ensuring high quality, architecturally compatible, consistently landscaped development throughout the District; 
(2)  Stimulating commercial, high technology and service-based activities; 
(3)  Ensuring that new development or redevelopment projects enhance the visual character of the District; 
(4)  Encouraging people to reside in the District; 
(5)  Encouraging the beautification of West Dixie Highway; and 
(6)  Encouraging new publically accessible open spaces. 
(B)  District Boundaries. The development standards shall be utilized for properties located within the Mixed-Use Employment Center District (MU/EC). 
(C)  Administration. In order to maintain predictability in development, Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) shall be prohibited. Variances from the dimensional requirements or waivers from any other criterion may be approved by the applicable review board for projects, provided that the applicant meets the standards pertaining to such variance or waiver. The applicable board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Director of the Community Development Department or his/her designee in the enforcement of these development regulations. 
(D)  General Development Standards. 
(1)  In addition to the standards contained herein, Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district standards shall be applicable to development within the Mixed-Use Employment Center District (MU/EC). The applicable regulations contained in Articles IV, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV shall also apply, except as modified herein and may be further modified by the City Manager or his/her designee to meet the purpose and intent of the Mixed-Use Employment Center District (MU/EC). 
(2)  The provisions of the MU/EC code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the existing zoning and land development regulations. 
(3)  The provisions of the building code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the provisions of the MU/EC code. 
(4)  Existing buildings may be destroyed or removed, however they must be replaced according to the MU/EC regulations. Existing buildings may not be destroyed or removed unless they are to be replaced according to MU/EC regulations and only after a building permit is issued. 
(5)  Existing buildings and uses within the MU/EC area, which are legally established but do not conform to provisions of the MU/EC regulations as of the effective date of these regulations shall be considered nonconforming and may not be replaced, restored, or modified, except in conformity with the regulation for nonconformities contained in Article IV of this chapter. When a nonconforming structure is destroyed by windstorm, flood, or nature disaster, it may be replaced by a new structure of the same or lesser size, and reoccupied by the same use, if construction of such structure is commenced within eighteen (18) months of destruction. 
(6)  Proposed development with site plan approved under the previous zoning regulations shall commence construction within the time frame allotted in the development order or site plan approval letter. If commencement of construction does not occur within the allotted time frame, the site plan approval shall automatically expire without further action by the City. 
(E)  Regulating Plans and Diagrams. The MU/EC is governed by a series of regulating plans and diagrams. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams demonstrate MU/EC development standards in both words and diagrams, and include maps designating the locations where the various standards apply. Unless otherwise noted, all development shall be in compliance with the Regulating Plans and Diagrams contained herein and with the Building Typology and Placement Regulating Diagrams in Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams for the MU/EC are based on two (2) development scenarios for the area adjacent to the existing single family residential district and include the following: 
(1)  The Sub-areas Regulating Plan, which divides the MU/EC into three (3) Sub-areas: Core, Transition and Edge. The highest density and intensity within the MU/EC shall be allocated to the Core Sub-area, a mixed-use area in the heart of the district. The densities and intensities shall then gradually decrease from the Core to the Transition Sub-area where mixed-uses are still permitted and then further decrease to the Edge Sub-area which is characterized by single uses, including low density residential adjacent to existing low density residential. The Sub-areas Regulating Plan for each development scenario is shown in Figures MU/EC-1a and 1b. 
(2)  The Street Network Connectivity Regulating Plan, which shows the approximate location of existing and required new streets needed to create the prescribed network of streets within the MU/EC. This Plan also establishes the hierarchy of the streets for each development scenario as shown in Figures MU/EC-2a and 2b. 
(3)  The Designated Publically Accessible Open Spaces and Urban Greenway Systems Regulating Plan, which designates the approximate locations of required publically accessible open spaces and urban greenway system for each development scenario as shown in Figures MU/EC-3a and 3b. 
(4)  The Building Heights Regulating Plan, which establishes the maximum building height for each development scenario as shown in Figures MU/EC-4a and 4b.

(F)  Sub-Areas Regulating Plan. All new and existing development shall review first their location within the Sub-Areas Regulating Plan as shown in Figure MU/EC-1. 
(G)  Permitted Uses. 
(1)  Land Use Principles. 
a.  The MU/EC District shall be developed as an identifiable place and shall act as an important center for living and working. The mix of uses within the District, the streets and the architectural character of individual buildings shall blend together to contribute to a coherent identity and sense of place. 
b.  The MU/EC District is anticipated to have a mix of intense non-residential uses and higher density residential uses that are both vertically and horizontally integrated. Compatibility of adjacent uses shall be addressed through building and site design elements. Service and/or high production areas associated with new intense non-residential uses shall be fully enclosed and concealed from the view of the residential use. Entrances for the non-residential uses shall be kept separate from the entrance to the residential use. Noise shall also be addressed through the use of appropriate sound barriers in the building construction. 
c.  New residential or mixed-use development adjacent to existing intense non-residential uses shall be designed in a manner that the adjacent intense non-residential use is entirely screened along the adjacent side and not visible from the residential portion of the building. Walls, landscaped buffers and parking areas shall be utilized to screen the intense non-residential use. 
d.  New auto oriented uses, as defined and permitted herein, shall only be permitted when fully enclosed in a building and/or parking structure and concealed from the view of residential and mixed-uses. 
e.  Irrespective of the standards applicable in the Mixed-Use (MU) District or in the MU/EC, the following existing auto-oriented uses and auto-oriented use categories shall continue to be permitted in the MU/EC, provided they shall only be permitted at locations where they already existed or that had a site plan approved for such use prior to March, 2015: 
i.  All boat-related uses such as Commercial: Boat and Marine Sales and Service Uses; 
ii.  All auto-oriented use types, including but not limited to Car Wash or Auto Detailing uses, Commercial: Motor Vehicle Sales and Service Uses; and 
iii.  Any use including Drive-Through Service. The entire principal use associated with the Drive-Through Service shall also be considered as permitted. 
1.  Until such time that the permitted auto-oriented use converts to a new principal use type, the permitted auto-oriented uses shall be exempt from compliance with all Mixed-Use (MU) and MU/EC Standards. 
f.  Until such time that the permitted auto-oriented use converts to a new principal use type, the permitted auto-oriented uses, including the structures and lots, shall be governed by the development standards for the previous Zoning District in Article V, including but not limited to, all applicable Development Review Procedures in Article XV, Nonconformities Standards in Article IV, if applicable; and the applicable Supplemental Regulations in Article VIII. 
g.  Along West Dixie Highway and NE 163rd Street, the ground floor of all buildings shall be limited to non-residential uses, including but not limited to employment, office and retail uses. On the second level and above, both non-residential and residential uses shall be permitted. 
h.  Along all other streets and on all levels, both non-residential and residential uses shall be permitted. 
i.  Where a proposed development is adjacent to an existing single family property and/or district, the proposed development shall either provide a landscaped buffer or a development of lower intensity adjacent to the existing single family residential district, as shown in the two (2) development scenarios and as specified below. 
i.  In scenario number one (1), where the proposed development provides a landscaped buffer, the proposed development shall: 
a.  Create a one hundred-foot wide landscaped buffer within the proposed project property along the property line, between the proposed development and the adjacent single family residential district.

Sec. 24-58.3 - Mixed-Use Neighborhood Center District (MU/NC). 
(A)  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these regulations is to implement policies that guide the design of development within the Mixed-Use Neighborhood Center District (MU/NC). The intent is to support a balanced mix of land uses characterized by compactness, pedestrian friendly design, neighborhood-scale and framed by architecture and landscape design appropriate to local history and the natural environment. Development patterns shall generally reflect planning and design principles such as walkable neighborhoods oriented around the five-minute walk, primary orientation towards public transit systems, a centrally located community-serving land use or land uses and greater integration of housing, employment, shopping and recreation at the neighborhood level. This purpose will be fulfilled by: 
(1)  Ensuring high quality, architecturally compatible, consistently landscaped development throughout the District; 
(2)  Stimulating neighborhood commercial and retail activities; 
(3)  Ensuring that new development or redevelopment projects enhance the visual character of the District; 
(4)  Encouraging the development of pleasant shopping areas with attractive pedestrian spaces; 
(5)  Encouraging people to reside in the District; 
(6)  Encouraging the beautification of West Dixie Highway; and 
(7)  Encouraging new publically accessible open spaces. 
(B)  District Boundaries. The development standards shall be utilized for properties located within the Mixed-Use Neighborhood Center District (MU/NC). 
(C)  Administration. In order to maintain predictability in development, Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) shall be prohibited. Variances from the dimensional requirements or waivers from any other criterion may be approved by the applicable review board for projects, provided that the applicant meets the standards pertaining to such variance or waiver. The applicable board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Director of the Community Development Department or his/her designee in the enforcement of these development regulations. 
(D)  General Development Standards. 
(1)  In addition to the standards contained herein, Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district standards shall be applicable to development within the Mixed-Use Neighborhood Center District (MU/NC). The applicable regulations contained in Articles IV, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV shall also apply, except as modified herein and may be further modified by the City Manager or his/her designee to meet the purpose and intent of the Mixed-Use Neighborhood Center District (MU/NC). 
(2)  The provisions of the MU/NC code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the existing zoning and land development regulations. 
(3)  The provisions of the building code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the provisions of the MU/NC code. 
(4)  Existing buildings may be destroyed or removed, however they must be replaced according to the MU/NC regulations. Existing buildings may not be destroyed or removed unless they are to be replaced according to MU/NC regulations and only after a building permit is issued. 
(5)  Existing buildings and uses within the MU/NC area, which are legally established but do not conform to provisions of the MU/NC regulations as of the effective date of these regulations shall be considered nonconforming and may not be replaced, restored, or modified, except in conformity with the regulation for nonconformities contained in Article IV of this chapter. When a nonconforming structure is destroyed by windstorm, flood, or nature disaster, it may be replaced by a new structure of the same or lesser size, and reoccupied by the same use, if construction of such structure is commenced within eighteen (18) months of destruction. 
(6)  Proposed development with site plan approved under the previous zoning regulations shall commence construction within the time frame allotted in the development order or site plan approval letter. If commencement of construction does not occur within the allotted time frame, the site plan approval shall automatically expire without further action by the City. 
(E)  Regulating Plans and Diagrams. The MU/NC is governed by a series of regulating plans and diagrams. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams demonstrate MU/NC development standards in both words and diagrams, and include maps designating the locations where the various standards apply. Unless otherwise noted, all development shall be in compliance with the Regulating Plans and Diagrams contained herein and with the Building Typology and Placement Regulating Diagrams in Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams for the MU/NC include the following: 
(1)  The Sub-areas Regulating Plan, which divides the MU/NC into two (2) Sub-areas: Core, and Transition. The highest density and intensity within the MU/NC shall be allocated to the Core Sub-area, a mixed-use area in the heart of the district. The densities and intensities shall then gradually decrease from the Core to the Transition Sub-area, which is adjacent to existing medium density residential, and mixed-uses are still permitted. The Sub-areas Regulating Plan is shown in Figure MU/NC-1. 
(2)  The Street Network Connectivity Regulating Plan, which shows the approximate location of existing and required new streets needed to create the prescribed network of streets within the MU/NC. This Plan also establishes the hierarchy of the streets as shown in Figure MU/NC-2. 
(3)  The Designated Publically Accessible Open Spaces and Urban Greenway Systems Regulating Plan, which designates the approximate location of required publically accessible open spaces and urban greenway system as shown in Figure MU/NC-3. 
(4)  The Building Heights Regulating Plan, which establishes the maximum building height as shown in Figure MU/NC-4.

(G)  Permitted Uses. 
(1)  Land Use Principles. 
a.  The MU/NC District shall be developed as an identifiable place and shall act as an important center for living, working, shopping and entertainment. The mix of uses within the District, the streets and the architectural character of individual buildings shall blend together to contribute to a coherent identity and sense of place. 
b.  Along all streets and on all levels, both non-residential and residential uses shall be permitted. 
(2)  Permitted Use Table MU/NC-1 includes the principal uses permitted in the MU/NC along with any required restrictions on such uses, for each of the sub-areas. Principal uses not included in Table MU/NC-1 are not permitted in the MU/NC. The MU/NC shall be subject to the Supplemental Regulations as provided for in Article VIII unless modified herein.

Sec. 24-58.4 - Arch Creek Mixed-Use Corridor District (MU/C). 
(A)  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these regulations is to implement policies that guide the design of development within the Arch Creek Mixed-Use Corridor District (MU/C). The intent is to support a balanced mix of land uses characterized by compactness, pedestrian friendly design, neighborhood-scale and framed by architecture and landscape design appropriate to local history and the natural environment. Development patterns shall generally reflect planning and design principles such as walkable neighborhoods oriented around the five-minute walk, primary orientation towards public transit systems, a centrally located community-serving land use or land uses and greater integration of housing, employment, shopping and recreation at the neighborhood level. This purpose will be fulfilled by: 
(1)  Ensuring high quality, architecturally compatible, consistently landscaped development throughout the District; 
(2)  Stimulating neighborhood commercial and retail activities; 
(3)  Ensuring that new development or redevelopment projects enhance the visual character of Biscayne Boulevard in terms of massing and scale; 
(4)  Encouraging the development of pleasant shopping areas with attractive pedestrian spaces; 
(5)  Encouraging people to reside in the District; and 
(6)  Encouraging new publically accessible open spaces. 
(B)  District Boundaries. The development standards shall be utilized for properties located within the Arch Creek Mixed-Use Corridor District (MU/C). 
(C)  Administration. In order to maintain predictability in development, Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) shall be prohibited. Variances from the dimensional requirements or waivers from any other criterion may be approved by the applicable review board for projects, provided that the applicant meets the standards pertaining to such variance or waiver. The applicable board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Director of the Community Development Department or his/her designee in the enforcement of these development regulations. 
(D)  General Development Standards. 
(1)  In addition to the standards contained herein, Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district standards shall be applicable to development within the Arch Creek Mixed-Use Corridor District (MU/C). The applicable regulations contained in Articles IV, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV shall also apply, except as modified herein and may be further modified by the City Manager to meet the purpose and intent of the Arch Creek Mixed-Use Corridor District (MU/C). 
(2)  The provisions of the MU/C code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the existing zoning and land development regulations. 
(3)  The provisions of the building code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the provisions of the MU/C code. 
(4)  Existing buildings may be destroyed or removed, however they must be replaced according to the MU/C regulations. Existing buildings may not be destroyed or removed unless they are to be replaced according to MU/C regulations and only after a building permit is issued. 
(5)  Existing buildings and uses within the MU/C area, which are legally established but do not conform to provisions of the MU/C regulations as of the effective date of these regulations shall be considered nonconforming and may not be replaced, restored, or modified, except in conformity with the regulation for nonconformities contained in Article IV of this chapter. When a nonconforming structure is destroyed by windstorm, flood, or nature disaster, it may be replaced by a new structure of the same or lesser size, and reoccupied by the same use, if construction of such structure is commenced within eighteen (18) months of destruction. 
(6)  Proposed development with site plan approved under the previous zoning regulations shall commence construction within the time frame allotted in the development order or site plan approval letter. If commencement of construction does not occur within the allotted time frame, the site plan approval shall automatically expire without further action by the City. 
(E)  Regulating Plans and Diagrams. The MU/C is governed by a series of regulating plans and diagrams. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams demonstrate MU/C development standards in both words and diagrams, and include maps designating the locations where the various standards apply. Unless otherwise noted, all development shall be in compliance with the Regulating Plans and Diagrams contained herein and with the Building Typology and Placement Regulating Diagrams in Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams for the MU/C include the following: 
(1)  The Sub-areas Regulating Plan, which divides the MU/C into three (3) Sub-areas: Core, Transition and Edge. The highest density and intensity within the MU/C shall be allocated to the Core Sub-area, a mixed-use area in the heart of the district. The densities and intensities shall then gradually decrease from the Core to the Transition Sub-area where mixed-uses are still permitted and then further decrease to the Edge Sub-area which is characterized by single uses, including low density residential adjacent to existing low density residential. The Sub-areas Regulating Plan is shown in Figure MU/C-1. 
(2)  The Street Network Connectivity Regulating Plan, which shows the approximate location of existing and the required new streets needed to create the prescribed network of streets within the MU/C. This Plan also establishes the hierarchy of the streets as shown in Figure MU/C-2. 
(3)  The Designated Publically Accessible Open Spaces and Urban Greenway Systems Regulating Plan, which designates the approximate location of the required publically accessible open spaces and urban greenway system as shown in Figure MU/C-3.

(G)  Permitted Uses. 
(1)  Land Use Principles. 
a.  The MU/C District shall be developed as an identifiable place and shall act as an important center for living, working, shopping and entertainment. The mix of uses within the District, the streets and the architectural character of individual buildings shall blend together to contribute to a coherent identity and sense of place. 
b.  The MU/C District is anticipated to have a mix of intense non-residential uses, such as big box retail establishments and office park style developments, and higher density residential uses that are both vertically and horizontally integrated. Compatibility of adjacent uses shall be addressed through building and site design elements. Service and/or non-active use areas associated with new intense non-residential uses shall be fully enclosed and concealed from the view of the residential use. Entrances for the non-residential uses shall be kept separate from the entrance to the residential use. Noise shall also be addressed through the use of appropriate sound barriers in the building construction. 
c.  Along NE 20th Place only, south of NE 140th Street, all levels of the portion of the buildings fronting NE 20th Place shall be limited to residential uses. 
d.  Along all other streets and on all levels, both non-residential and residential uses shall be permitted. 
e.  Where a proposed development is adjacent to the Highland Village Neighborhood, the proposed development shall: 
i.  There shall be a Transitional Area adjacent to the single family property. The Transitional Area shall extend for the length of the portion of the proposed development that lies adjacent to and directly faces the adjacent Highland Village Neighborhood. The depth of the Transitional Area shall be as specified in the Building Heights Regulating Plan. Any road, canal, waterway, park or alley between the adjacent single family property and the proposed development, or within the Transitional Area of the proposed development, shall be counted toward the depth necessary to comply with this section. 
The Transitional Area shall be developed as follows: 
1.  The height of the proposed development adjacent to the Highland Village Neighborhood shall be as specified in the Building Heights Regulating Plan Figure MU/C-4. 
2.  Within the first one hundred twenty (120) feet of the Transitional Area, the proposed development shall be limited to residential uses. 
3.  All or part of the Transitional Area may be developed as landscaped open space and/or recreational uses. 
(2)  Permitted Use Table MU/C-1 includes the principal uses permitted in the MU/C along with any required restrictions on such uses, for each of the sub-areas. Principal uses not included in Table MU/C-1 are not permitted in the MU/C. The MU/C shall be subject to the Supplemental Regulations as provided for in Article VIII unless modified herein. Uses which are similar in nature to the uses permitted herein, but not enumerated in higher density use areas, shall be permitted upon a finding by the Community Development Director that the characteristics of, and activities associated with the use are substantially similar to one or more of the listed uses, and will not involve greater impacts than the uses listed in the district and the use will be consistent with the purposes of the applicable zoning district and use areas.

Sec. 24-58.5 - Southern Mixed-Use Waterfront District (MU/SWF). 
(A)  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these regulations is to implement policies that guide the design of development within the SOUTHERN Mixed-Use Waterfront District (SOUTHERN MU/WF). The intent of the SOUTHERN MU/WF district is to establish a Mixed-use area that provides for multi-family housing that enables residents to live on the waterfront. Providing new publically accessible open spaces as well as public access to and beautification of the waterfront are primary principals of the SOUTHERN MU/WF district. Development patterns shall generally reflect planning and design principles such as walkable neighborhoods oriented around the five-minute walk. Additionally, there shall be primary orientation towards the waterfront, integration of housing, employment, shopping and recreation at the neighborhood level. This purpose will be fulfilled by: 
(1)  Ensuring high quality, architecturally compatible, consistently landscaped development throughout the District; 
(2)  Ensuring that new development or redevelopment projects enhance the visual character of Biscayne Boulevard in terms of massing and scale; 
(3)  Stimulating neighborhood commercial and retail activities; 
(4)  Encouraging people to reside in the District; 
(5)  Ensuring public access to and the beautification of the waterfront; 
(6)  Ensuring new publically accessible open space; and 
(7)  Ensuring appropriate screening from residential views related to the electrical substation. 
(B)  District Boundaries. The development standards shall be utilized for properties located within the SOUTHERN Mixed-Use Waterfront District (SOUTHERN MU/WF). 
(C)  Administration. In order to maintain predictability in development, Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) shall be prohibited. Variances from the dimensional requirements or waivers from any other criterion may be approved by the applicable review board for projects, provided that the applicant meets the standards pertaining to such variance or waiver. The applicable board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Director of the Community Development Department or his/her designee in the enforcement of these development regulations. 
(D)  General Development Standards. 
(1)  In addition to the standards contained herein, Section 24-58 Mixed-Use (MU) district standards shall be applicable to development within the SOUTHERN Mixed-Use Waterfront District (SOUTHERN MU/WF). The applicable regulations contained in Articles IV, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV shall also apply, except as modified herein and may be further modified by the City Manager or his/her designee to meet the purpose and intent of the SOUTHERN Mixed-Use Waterfront District (SOUTHERN MU/WF). 
(2)  The provisions of the SOUTHERN MU/WF code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the existing zoning and land development regulations. 
(3)  The provisions of the building code, when in conflict, shall take precedence over the provisions of the SOUTHERN MU/WF code. 
(4)  Existing buildings may be destroyed or removed, however they must be replaced according to the SOUTHERN MU/WF regulations. Existing buildings may not be destroyed or removed unless they are to be replaced according to SOUTHERN MU/WF regulations and only after a building permit is issued. 
(5)  Existing buildings and uses within the SOUTHERN MU/WF area, which are legally established but do not conform to provisions of the SOUTHERN MU/WF regulations as of the effective date of these regulations shall be considered nonconforming and may not be replaced, restored, or modified, except in conformity with the regulation for nonconformities contained in Article IV of this chapter. When a nonconforming structure is destroyed by windstorm, flood, or nature disaster, it may be replaced by a new structure of the same or lesser size, and reoccupied by the same use, if construction of such structure is commenced within eighteen (18) months of destruction. 
(6)  Proposed development with site plan approved under the previous zoning regulations shall commence construction within the time frame allotted in the development order or site plan approval letter. If commencement of construction does not occur within the allotted time frame, the site plan approval shall automatically expire without further action by the City. 
(E)  Regulating Plans and Diagrams. The SOUTHERN MU/WF is governed by a series of regulating plans and diagrams. The Regulating Plans and Diagrams demonstrate SOUTHERN MU/WF development standards in both words and diagrams, and include maps designating the locations where the various standards apply.

(1)  Presumption. The advertising or advertisement for the short-term rental of a single-family home or town home property for the purpose of allowing a rental in violation of this section shall create a rebuttable presumption against the owner that it is more likely than not that the property is being used in violation of Section 24-90.1. Pursuant to the procedures provided for in Sections 14-8.13-14-8.19, a rebuttable presumption against the owner that the residential property named in the notice of violation or as identified in the advertising or advertisement is a violation of this section shall be applied.

(7)  In addition, or in lieu of the foregoing, the City may seek an injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce compliance with or to prohibit the violation of Section 24-90.1, as to each lease. If the City seeks an injunction to enforce compliance with or to prohibit a violation of Section 24-90.1, the City shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs expended in seeking injunctive relief. 
(8)  A certified copy of an order imposing the civil fines and penalties must be recorded in the public records, and thereafter shall constitute a lien upon the subject property and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator and it may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed to be a court judgement except for enforcement purposes.

The calculation shall be based on the overall dimensions of the existing structure together with the proposed change, use, alteration or enlargement. If additional spaces are required, a revised site plan shall be submitted for review and approval. The requisite spaces shall then be provided. 
(4)  Alteration: When any use or structure is altered or enlarged, with a resultant increase in floor area, capacity, or space occupied, whatever necessary additional off-street parking that may be required shall be provided, and a revised site plan shall be submitted for review and approval. 
(5)  Change of use: Where a use or structure which existed at the effective date of this article is changed in use or occupancy to a category of use or occupancy that required more off-street parking facilities, the increased amount of those facilities shall be provided. 
(B)  Joint and Shared Use Facilities. Under no circumstances shall joint or shared use parking facilities be farther than five hundred (500) feet away from the buildings using these facilities. 
(1)  Joint usage: Two (2) or more adjacent structures or uses under the same ownership or management may collectively provide their required off-street parking, provided that the total number of parking spaces provided shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses if computed separately. The reservation or assignment of required off-street parking spaces for use by specific individuals or commercial establishments located within that structure or premise shall not be permitted. This provision shall not prohibit the designation of handicapped or emergency spaces. 
(2)  Shared usage: Notwithstanding any other parking requirements set forth in this article for individual land uses, when any land or building is used for two (2) or more distinguishable purposes (as listed in the Shared Parking Credit Table), the minimum total number of parking spaces required to serve the combination of all uses may be determined as follows:

These covenants shall provide that the use, or portion of a use, that requires the shared parking in order to obtain the necessary permits or licenses, shall cease and terminate upon any change in their respective schedules of operation that results in conflicting or overlapping usage of the parking facilities. The covenant shall also provide that the City may collect costs and attorney fees if litigation is necessary. 
(C)  Restrictions. The storage, sale or repair of merchandise or vehicles or the display of signs or advertising devices on vehicles, structures or land, shall not be permitted in any off-street parking areas.

Sec. 24-107 - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives. 
(A)  Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Florida has in Chapter 166, Florida Statutes, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of North Miami Beach, Florida does ordain as follows: 
(B)  Findings of Fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of North Miami Beach are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(C)  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage throughout their intended lifespan; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(D)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life, health and to eliminate or minimize property damage; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act [P.L. 97-348]), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. For the purpose of determining substantial damage, the market value used by the City of North Miami Beach shall be the total appraised value according to the latest records of the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser. The property owner may appeal that determination as provided in this Article X of the Zoning and Land Development Code of the City of North Miami Beach, Florida. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, addition, or improvements to a building or structure, taking place during a (5) year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the building, or structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, the market value used by the City of North Miami Beach in the absence of a recent appraisal shall be the total appraised value according to the latest records of the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser which may be appealed as provided herein, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial damage" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or Safety Code specifications which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. The market value used by the City of North Miami Beach in the absence of a recent appraisal shall be the total appraised value according to the latest records of the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser which may be appealed as provided herein. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of this article does not automatically confer on the applicant a variance from the requirements of the Florida Building Code, the technical construction codes, the Fire Code, or other laws, codes and ordinances that may apply to construction in flood prone areas. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(B)  Permit Procedures. Application for a Development Permit shall be made to the Director of Community Development or designee on forms furnished by him or her prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question: existing and proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
(1)  Application Stage. 
(a)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all buildings; 
(b)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential building will be flood-proofed; 
(c)  Certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential flood-proofed building will meet the flood-proofing criteria in Section 24-111(B)(2); 
(d)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as the result of proposed development; and 
(2)  Construction Stage. Provide a floor elevation or flood-proofing certification after the lowest floor is completed. Upon placement of the lowest floor, or flood-proofing by whatever construction means, or upon placement of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Director of Community Development or his designee a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, flood-proofed elevation, or the elevation of the lowest portion of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea level.

(6)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this article, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(7)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(8)  Conditions for Variances: 
(a)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(b)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or a conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(c)  Required Variance Notification: Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a City official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five ($25.00) dollars per one hundred ($100.00) dollars of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood elevation level increases risks to life and property. 
A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Director of Community Development or designee in the Office of the Clerk of the Court for Miami-Dade County and shall be recorded in a manner so that it will appear in the property records of the affected parcel of land.

(B)  Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in Section 24-109(B), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, there must be a minimum of two (2) openings on different sides of each enclosed area sufficient to facilitate the automatic equalization of flood hydrostatic forces in accordance with standards of Section 24-111(B)(3). 
(2)  Nonresidential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A-zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied using the Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood-proofing Certificate. Such certification along with the supporting engineering data and calculations, and construction, operational, and maintenance plans shall be provided to the Director of Community Development or designee as set forth in Section 24-110(C)(9). 
(3)  Elevated Buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
(a)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect, as appropriate to the work being certified, to meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

ARTICLE XI. - LANDSCAPING 

Sec. 24-115 - Purpose. 
    The purpose and intent of this article is to provide regulation for the installation and maintenance of landscaping and landscaped open space. This article also promotes water conservation measures for landscaping that maximizes the efficient use of water by the use of native and regionally adapted plants, trees, turfs and efficient irrigation design and applications. Employing water-efficient landscaping techniques, also known as Xeriscaping, generally results in long-term reduction in irrigation requirements, costs, energy and maintenance. Trees and plants are integral and vital parts of the earth's ecosystem: they conserve energy; they provide essential and desirable benefits to man, including the production of life supporting oxygen, the reduction of carbon dioxide, the filtering of dust and gaseous pollutants; they serve as a natural abatement to noise pollution; they camouflage unsightly views; they provide shelter to birds and wildlife; they enhance the value of property; they preserve open space; and they maintain and improve the aesthetic quality of the City of North Miami Beach, thereby promoting the health and general welfare of its citizenry. In addition, it is the policy of the City Council that every effort shall be made to preserve and maintain viable vegetation within the City of North Miami Beach. 
Sec. 24-116 - Applicability. 
    The provisions of Article XI contained herein shall be applicable to all projects comprising new construction or substantial additions and alterations, except as set forth in Section 24-116.1, Administrative Waiver. Also, if landscape in excess of fifty (50) percent of total site landscaping requires replacement, the entire property shall be brought up to current landscape standards and requirements. This provision regarding existing development shall be applicable to the greatest extent reasonably possible as determined by the City Manager or designee. 
Sec. 24-116.1 - Administrative Waiver. 
    Where the requirements of this article relate to the improvement or the expansion of an existing vehicular use area or the changing or expansion of an existing use or structure and where certain requirements are considered by the Director to be either impossible or impractical to comply with unless portions of existing structures are removed or by substantially reducing the number of required parking spaces, the administrative relief from such requirement may be granted by the Director provided that the intent and purpose of this article is not compromised.

Sec. 24-152.1 - Permit For New Sign or Sign Modification. 
    An application for construction, creation or installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be accompanied by detailed drawings to show the dimensions, design, structure, and location of each particular sign, to the extent that such details are not contained on a Uniform Signage Plan then in effect for the zone lot. One application and permit may include multiple signs on the same zone lot. 
Sec. 24-152.2 - Annual Inspection. 
(A)  The City Manager or designee shall inspect and inventory all permanent signs within the City at least once each year. Upon such inspection, the City Manager or designee shall require the owner of any sign found to be in defective condition, or which does not comply with the terms, conditions, and provisions of this article, to be repaired or removed within thirty (30) days from the date of notice of such defect; provided, however, that if the City Manager or designee shall ascertain and determine that the maintenance or use of such sign shall adversely affect the public safety, he may require the immediate removal at owner's expense, or prohibit the use of this sign until such defects shall have been remedied. 
(B)  The City Manager or designee shall have the right, upon forty-eight (48) hours notice, to remove any sign which is not properly maintained, shows neglect, becomes dilapidated or is otherwise in violation of provisions of this article, with or without notice, if such sign is found unsafe or encroaches on public right-of-way. 
(C)  The City Manager or designee shall cause an inspection of the zone lot for which each permit for a new sign or for modification of an existing sign is issued during the sixth month after the issuance of such permit or at such earlier date as the owner may request. If the construction is not substantially complete at the time of inspection, the permit shall lapse and become void. If the construction is complete and in full compliance with this article and with the Building and Electrical Codes, the City Manager or designee shall affix to the premises a permanent symbol identifying the sign(s) and the applicable permit by number or other reference. If the construction is substantially complete but not in full compliance with this article and applicable Codes, the City Manager shall give the owner or applicant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional thirty (30) days from the date of inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If the deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the permit shall lapse. If the construction is then complete, the City Manager or designee shall affix to the premises the permanent symbol described above. 
Sec. 24-153 - Sign Permits-Continuing. 
    The owner of a zone lot containing signs requiring a permit under this article shall at all times maintain in force a sign permit for such property. Sign permits shall be issued for individual zone lots, notwithstanding the fact that a particular zone lot may be included with other zone lots in a Uniform Signage Plan. 
Sec. 24-153.1 - Initial Sign Permit. 
    An initial sign permit shall be issued by the City Manager or designee covering the period from the date of the inspection of the completed sign installation, construction, or modification through the last day of that calendar year. 
Sec. 24-153.2 - Sign Permits, Subsequent. 
    Sign permits shall be issued for twelve (12) months. Except as provided herein, sign permits shall be renewable annually at the renewal of the business tax receipt, upon submission of a renewal application form and the applicable fees. 
    Renewal applications shall contain a photograph and a representation by the applicant that no change in signage under the permit has been made or shall contain dimensions, drawings, and photos of any changes. 
Sec. 24-153.3 - Lapse of Sign Permit. 
    A continuing sign permit shall lapse automatically if not renewed or if the business license for the premises lapses, is revoked, or is not renewed. A sign permit shall also lapse if the business activity on the premises is discontinued for a period of sixty (60) days or more and is not renewed within thirty (30) calendar days of a notice from the City to the last permittee, sent to the premises that the sign permit will lapse if such activity is not renewed. 
Sec. 24-153.4 - Assignment of Sign Permits. 
    A current and valid sign permit shall be freely assignable to a successor as owner of the property or holder of a business license for the same premises, subject only to filing such application as the City Manager may require and paying any applicable fee. The assignment shall be accomplished by filing and shall not require approval. 
Sec. 24-154 - Nonconforming Signs. 
(A)  Any sign or advertising within the City of North Miami Beach on the effective date of this article, or a sign or advertising structure existing within any area annexed to the City after the effective date of this article, [1] which, by its height, area, location, use or structural support does not conform to the requirements of this article, shall be termed nonconforming. 
(B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the owner of any zone lot or other premises on which exists a sign that does not conform with the requirements of this ordinance or for which there is no current and valid sign permit shall be obligated to remove such sign or, in the case of nonconforming sign, to bring it into conformity with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(C)  Removal/Amortization Schedule. 
(1)  All nonconforming signs or advertising structures shall be removed or altered so as to conform to the provisions of this article, within four (4) years from the effective date of this article. 
(2)  However, for nonconforming signs of outstanding merit, as determined by the City Manager, the amortization period may be extended for an additional period of four (4) years. However, this extension may not be granted for signs which would violate the property's uniform signage agreement.

(Ord. No. 92-18, 10-5-92) 
ARTICLE XIV. - PUBLIC FACILITY CAPACITY; CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 24-160 - Adequacy of Public Facilities and Services. 
    Public facilities and services may be determined to be adequate to serve the needs of a proposed development when traffic circulation, recreation, drainage and flood protection, potable water, solid waste and sanitary sewer public facilities and services will be available to meet established level-of-service standards, consistent with Chapter 163 Florida Statutes and the concurrency management provisions of this article. 
Sec. 24-161 - Concurrency Standards and Procedures. 
(A)  Level of Service Standards. New development shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available design capacity to sustain the following levels of service as established in the North Miami Beach Comprehensive Plan: 
(1)  Streets:* 
"F"-I-95, Biscayne Boulevard, North Miami Beach Boulevard and N.E. Sixth Avenue 
"D" all other Arterials and Collectors 
"B" all local streets 
(2)  Sanitary sewer: The City collection system shall accommodate an average daily flow of at least eighty-five (85) gallons per person (total City population) per day in the service area. The County treatment and disposal system shall operate with a design capacity of two (2) percent above the daily flow of the preceding year. Otherwise, septic tanks shall be the level of service, subject to County approval of site suitability. 
(3)  Drainage: Adequately accommodate stormwater runoff from a twenty-four (24) hour, ten (10) year frequency storm. 
(4)  Water: The City's water system shall provide at least one hundred fifty (150) gallons per person per day at a pressure of at least forty (40) pounds per square inch. 
(5)  Solid waste: City trucks and the County disposal system shall be able to accommodate 5.5 pounds per capita per day. 
    *Upon a State Department of Community Affairs finding that the City Comprehensive Plan is in "compliance," these standards are expected to change and will immediately apply for purposes of this article. 
(6)  Recreation: 
Neighborhood Park ..... 2 acres/1,000 residents 
Tennis Courts ..... 1/2,000 residents 
Basketball Courts ..... 1/5,000 residents 
Tot Lot ..... 1/10,000 residents 
Gymnasium/Auditorium ..... 1/12,000 residents 
Playing Fields ..... 1/5,000 residents 
Swimming Pool ..... 1/25,000 residents 
(B)  Development Subject to Adequacy Determination. 
(1)  New development: All development permits including site plans, plats, conditional use applications, rezoning and building permits for principal buildings. 
(2)  Additional development or redevelopment: All redevelopment or additional development of previously improved lands shall be subject to an adequacy determination for the additional capacity needed to serve the difference between the capacity to be consumed by the proposed additional development and the capacity generated or consumed by the existing development. 
(3)  Property which is exempt: Exempt property includes: 
(a)  Development which is authorized by an approved Development of Regional Impact (DRI) Development Order. 
(b)  Development which is found by the City attorney to have vested rights with regard to any effected roadway segments or infrastructure capacity reservations. 
(c)  Development which is one single family or duplex dwelling on a lot in single and separate ownership from adjacent lots. 
(d)  Any development which clearly causes no increase in public facility usage due to the similarity in use; however, any increase in the amount of required parking shall require concurrency. 
(e)  Development which is a government facility which the City Council finds is essential to the health or safety of the City residents. 
(C)  Measurement of Level-of-Service Capacities. The Miami-Dade County Concurrency Information Center and Miami-Dade County Administrative Order #4-85 (July 1989) may be used as sources of facility capacities. More specifically: 
(1)  Water and wastewater: Measurement of the water capacity will be based on the design capacities of both the lines serving the property and the potable water supply system. City sewer capacity will be measured by the City treatment system capacity. Water demand and sewage generation rates will be based upon the City impact fee tables (Tables I and II at the end of this article) or an alternative method acceptable to the Director of Utilities. 
(2)  Roadways: The standard for measuring highway capacities shall be the Florida DOT Table of Generalized Daily Level-of-Service Maximum Volumes. The measurement of capacity may also be determined by engineering studies, the County Concurrency Information Center, the County's Administrative Order cited above or other data provided that analysis techniques are technically sound and acceptable to the Director of Public Works. 
Traffic generation shall be based upon the Institute of Transportation Engineers Manual. The impact shall be presumed to be limited to the collector or arterial serving the local street giving access to the lot, or to the collector or arterial giving direct access to the lot. 
(3)  Solid waste: Table III may be used to calculate solid waste generation rates. Projections are subject to approval by the Director of Public Works. 
(4)  Drainage: Measurement of drainage shall be based on assumed runoff rates (for example, from the South Florida Water Management District or FDOT tables) subject to approval by the Director of Public Works. Typically, this shall be achieved by a combination of on-site detention and French drains. 
(5)  Recreation: Measurement shall be based on data in the City Comprehensive Plan and the latest City population estimate with any necessary interpretation provided by the Director of Community Development. 
(D)  Determination of Capacity Availability. For purposes of these regulations, the capacity availability shall be determined by: 
(1)  Adding together: 
(a)  The total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
(b)  The total design capacity of any new facilities that will become available concurrent with the impact of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one (1) or more of the following is shown: 
For water, sewer, solid waste and drainage: 
1.  The necessary facilities are in place at the time a site plan or plat approval is issued, or 
2.  Such approval is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development occur, or 
3.  Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of site plan or plat approval, or 
4.  The new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to Section 163.3220, Florida Statutes, or an agreement or development order pursuant to Chapter 380, Florida Statutes. 
For recreation: 
1.  Paragraphs #1-3 above. 
2.  The new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of facilities to be completed within one (1) year of the time the development permit is issued, or 
3.  A development agreement whereby construction begins within one (1) year. 
For traffic: 
1.  The new facilities have been included in a financially feasible five-year capital improvement program and construction is scheduled for the third year or earlier, or 
2.  Paragraphs #1-3 directly above. 
(2)  Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
(a)  The design demand for the service created by existing development; and 
(b)  The new design demand for the service (by phase or otherwise) that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed site plan or plat by the anticipated completion of other presently approved development projects. 
(E)  Burden of Showing Compliance on Applicant. The burden of showing compliance with these levels of service requirements shall be upon the applicant. In order to be approvable, applications for development approval shall provide sufficient and verifiable information showing compliance with these standards. 
Sec. 24-162 - Concurrency Monitoring System. 
(A)  The Community Development Director shall be responsible for monitoring development activity to ensure the development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. All existing and committed development and its impact on facilities subject to level-of-service standards shall be recorded. Monitoring shall include: 
(1)  A monthly report of all new or amended development and Zoning Code regulations, including changes in zoning districts. 
(2)  A monthly summary of all building permits. 
(3)  A monthly summary of all permits issued for demolition of buildings. 
(4)  A monthly summary of all certificates of occupancy. 
Sec. 24-163 - Concurrency Rights Reservation and Effective Period. 
    Compliance will be finally calculated and capacity reserved at time of final action of an approved site plan, building permit if no site plan is required or enforceable developers agreement. Applications for development permits shall be chronologically logged upon approval to determine rights to available capacity. 
    A building permit application must be submitted within six (6) months of site plan approval to preserve the Concurrency reservation. An extension of one (1) year may be issued by the City Council. 
    Developer agreements as described in Chapter 163.3220, the "Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act" shall have a valid concurrency period not to exceed five (5) years or as may be modified.

ARTICLE XV. - OTHER DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES 

Sec. 24-170 - Cost Recovery for Consulting Services. 
(A)  Established. The City Manager or designee in reviewing any application, may refer it to an independent engineering, planning, legal, technical, or environmental consultant or professional(s) retained by the City as the Manager shall deem reasonably necessary to enable review of such application. Charges made by the independent consultant shall be in accord with those customarily made for services in Miami-Dade County, and pursuant to an existing agreement between the City and the independent consultant. Charges to the applicant for consulting services shall be similar to the hourly rates charged by the consultants. The applicant shall reimburse the City for the cost of such consultant or professional upon submission of a voucher and within thirty (30) days of submission. These fees are in addition to all other fees required by law, rule, or regulation. 
(B)  Escrow Accounts. Upon submission of any application or thereafter, the City Manager or designee may require an escrow account be established. The applicant shall provide funds for deposit into the account, as determined by the City Manager or designee. Withdrawals from that account shall reimburse the City for the cost of professional review services. The applicant shall be provided a voucher for such services when submitted to the City. When the balance in the escrow account is below one-third ( 1/3 ) of its initial amount, the applicant shall deposit additional funds up to the amount of the initial deposit. If the account is not replenished within thirty (30) days after the applicant is notified, in writing, of the requirement for such additional deposit, the City may suspend its review of the application. An application shall be deemed incomplete if any amount is outstanding. A building permit or certificate of use and occupancy shall not be issued unless all professional review fees charged in connection with the applicant's project have been reimbursed to the City. Once all pertinent charges have been paid, the City shall refund to the applicant any funds remaining on deposit. 
(C)  Collection of Fees. All fees required pursuant to this chapter shall be collected by the City Manager or designee.

(G)  Review Standards. The following standards shall be utilized by all applicable individuals and departments involved in the review and evaluation of required plans and exhibits: 
(1)  Natural environment: All proposed development shall be designed in such a manner as to preserve, perpetuate and improve the existing natural character of the site. Existing trees and other landscape features shall, to the maximum extent possible, be preserved in their natural state and additional landscape features shall be provided to enhance architectural features, to relate structural design to the site, and to conceal unattractive areas and uses. Special attention shall be devoted to natural vegetation along waterfronts. See also Articles VII, XI and XII where applicable. 
(2)  Open space: Adequate open space shall be provided which meets the particular needs and demands of the proposed development and all specific zoning requirements. The type and distribution of all open space shall be determined by the character, intensity and anticipated residential or user composition of the proposed development. 
(a)  Passive open spaces (those areas not planned for intensive activity) shall be arranged as to enhance internal spatial relationships between proposed structures, to provide buffers between the project and adjacent less intensive uses, to facilitate pedestrian movements within the development, and to improve the overall visual quality of the site. 
(b)  Active open spaces (those areas containing activities such as playgrounds, tennis courts, swimming pools and other active recreational facilities) shall be located so as to permit easy access for all residents or users within a development. Private recreational facilities within specific projects shall, wherever possible, complement rather than duplicate nearby public recreational facilities. 
(3)  Circulation and parking: All circulation systems and parking facilities shall be designed and located in such a manner as to comply with the following: 
(a)  A clearly defined vehicular circulation system shall be provided which allows free movement within the proposed development while discouraging excessive speeds. Said system shall be separated insofar as practicable from pedestrian circulation systems. Pavement widths and access points to peripheral streets shall be provided which adequately serve the proposed development and which are compatible and functional with circulation systems outside the development. 
(b)  Whenever possible in proposed residential developments, living units should be located on residential streets or courts which are designed to discourage nonlocal through traffic. 
(c)  Off-street parking areas shall be located and designed in such a manner so as to not create any incompatible visual relationships. 
(d)  Safe and efficient access to all areas of the proposed development shall be provided for emergency and service vehicles. 
(4)  Community services and utilities: All proposed developments shall be designed and located in such a manner as to insure the adequate provision, use and compatibility of necessary community services and utilities. 
(a)  An adequate waste water collection system, including all necessary extensions and connections, shall be provided in accordance with City standards for location and design. Where necessitated by the size of the development, the public sanitary sewer connection is required; see Section 24-133. On-site wastewater systems must be provided in accordance with County standards and regulations. 
(b)  An efficient solid waste collection system including the provision of an adequate number of local receptacles in locations which afford maximum use and collection convenience, shall be provided in accordance with all applicable City standards. 
(c)  A well-designed internal system for fire protection, including the provision of properly located fire hydrants, adequate water pressure, and an efficient access arrangement for emergency fire vehicles, shall be provided to insure the safety of all persons within the project. 
(5)  Building and structures: All buildings and structures proposed to be located within a development shall be oriented and designed in such a manner as to enhance, rather than detract, from the overall quality of the environment. The following guidelines shall be followed in the review and evaluation of all buildings and structures: 
(a)  Proposed buildings and structures should be related harmoniously to the terrain, other buildings, and the surrounding neighborhood, and should not create through their location, scale, style, color or texture incompatible physical or visual relationships. 
(b)  Maximum privacy should be incorporated into the design of any individual residential units and related outdoor patio and living areas. 
(c)  Building location and other site features shall be reviewed in the context of any proposed road widenings, particularly the Biscayne Boulevard frontage. 
(d)  Proposed buildings located in Special Flood Hazard Areas as identified on flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall have the lowest floor elevated no lower than the level of the base flood elevation. 
(e)  Proposed buildings and site shall be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Miami-Dade County Code of Ordinances. 
(f)  Proposed buildings shall be compliant with the Fair Housing Act as required. 
(6)  Signs: Shall be reviewed in the context of Article XIII. 
(7)  Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design: All proposed development shall be designed to discourage and reduce the possibility of nuisance and criminal activity. Towards that goal, all applications for site plan approval shall be reviewed by the Police Department to assess areas or elements which may encourage crime and to insure opportunities for police surveillance. The Police Department shall analyze and make recommendations regarding all factors that affect crime prevention including, but not limited to, the following: Location, traffic, visibility, windows and doors, security lighting, parking lot lighting, use of digital security cameras, especially in parking areas and other common areas, including ingress and egress areas, and address numbers. In making recommendations, the Police Department shall apply generally accepted standards of environmental design calculated to promote crime prevention. 
(8)  Landscaping: All locations of plant materials shall be coordinated with the location of other elements of the site plan, particularly lighting fixtures and light poles. Landscaping and lighting shall not be placed in such a way as to cause the diminishment of illumination due to the placement of the lighting poles and plant materials or the future growth of the plant materials. 
(9)  Lighting: Placement of the lighting fixtures shall be coordinated with the placement of landscape materials, as noted above. 
(H)  Final Site Plan Approval. All applications for final site plan approval shall be submitted and reviewed in the following manner: 
(1)  Department: The applicant shall submit his application site plan to the Department of Community Development at least three (3) weeks prior to the technical review of applications for development (TRAD) at which the application is to be reviewed.

B.  Procedure: Application Criteria; Fees and Appeals. Any owner of a single family residential property may apply for an Administrative Code Waiver for violations existing prior to January 1, 2013. Property owners who have received courtesy notices of code violations, will have sixty (60) days from the date of the notice to apply for an Administrative Code Waiver. Failure to apply for an Administrative Code Waiver will result in the property owner having to remove the violation or follow the regular variance procedure outlined in the Code. 
    Property owners who have not been issued a Code violation may apply for an Administrative Code Waiver at any time up until the process is discontinued. Prior to applying for an Administrative Code Waiver, the property owner must submit an application along with a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) application fee to the City. 
    The application shall identify what the waiver is for and should include: 
1.  The reason for the waiver request. 
2.  Photos. 
3.  Copies of any notices of violation issued by the City. 
4.  How long the violation has existed.

Sec. 24-211 - Exemptions and Credits. 
(A)  The following shall be exempted from payment of the impact fee:

(1)  Public Safety land and/or Public Safety capital improvements may be offered by the feepayer as total or partial payment of the required impact fee.

1.  One hundred fifteen (115%) percent of the most recent assessed value by the Property Appraiser, or

(b)  Applicants for credit for construction of Public Safety improvements shall submit acceptable engineering drawings and specifications, and construction cost estimates to the City Manager. The City Manager shall determine credit for construction based upon either these cost estimates or upon alternative engineering criteria and construction cost estimates if the City Manager determines that such estimates submitted by the applicant are either unreliable or inaccurate. The City Manager shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate and return such signed document to the City Manager before credit will be given. The failures of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within sixty (60) days shall nullify the credit. 
(c)  Except as provided in paragraph (d), credit against impact fees otherwise due will not be provided until: 
1.  The construction is completed and accepted by the City, the County, or the State, whichever is applicable; 
2.  A suitable maintenance and warranty bond is received and approved by the City Clerk of the City of North Miami Beach, when applicable. 
(d)  Credit may be provided before completion of specified Public Safety improvements if adequate assurances are given by the applicant that the standards set out in paragraph (c) will be met and if the feepayer posts security as provided below for the costs of such construction. Security in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow agreement shall be posted with and approved by the City Clerk of the City of North Miami Beach in an amount determined by the City Manager. If the Public Safety construction project will not be constructed within one (1) year of the acceptance of the offer by the City Manager, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten (10%) percent compounded, for each year of the life of the security. The security shall be reviewed and approved by the City Council prior to acceptance of the security. If the Public Safety construction project is not to be completed within five (5) years of the date of the fee payer's offer, the City Council must approve the Public Safety construction project and its scheduled completion date prior to the acceptance of the offer by the City Manager. 
(2)  Any claim for credit must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
(3)  Determinations made by the City Manager pursuant to the credit provisions of this section may be appealed to the City Council by filing a written request with the City Manager within ten (10) days of the City Manager's determination. 
Sec. 24-212 - Penalty Provision. 
    A violation of this Article shall be prosecuted in the same manner as misdemeanors are prosecuted and upon conviction the violator shall be punishable according to law; however, in addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the City of North Miami Beach shall have the power to sue in civil court to enforce the provisions of this Article. 
Sec. 24-213 - Impact Fee Review and Updates. 
    On October 1, 2006, and on October 1 of each year thereafter in which the Police Impact Fee is in effect, the amount of the Police Impact Fee shall be automatically adjusted to account for inflationary increases in the cost of providing public facilities by the rate of three (3%) percent. 
    In lieu of this automatic annual adjustment, the City Council may, at its option, determine the appropriate adjustment pursuant to a report provided by the Office of the City Manager. 
    Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from electing to retain the existing police facilities impact fee or from electing to waive the inflation adjustment for any given fiscal year, or years.

The City may adopt additional fees or other consideration, provided that any fee or other consideration imposed by the City in excess of five hundred ($500.00) dollars per linear mile shall be applied in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not exceed the sum of: 
1.  Costs directly related to the inconvenience or impairment solely caused by the disturbance of the Public Rights-of-Way; 
2.  The reasonable cost of the regulatory activity of the City; and 
3.  The proportionate share of cost of land for such street, alley or other public way attributable to utilization of the Public Rights-of-Way by a Telecommunications Service Provider.

c.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the City shall at all times require the maximum compensation allowed under applicable law.

e.  Registrant shall not enter into any transaction or arrangement which has the effect of circumventing payment of required fees and/or evasion of payment of fees by noncollection, nonreporting of gross receipts, collection of revenues by its parent, affiliates or subsidiaries, bartering or any other means which evade the actual collection of revenues subject to the fee by Registrant. 
f.  The payments required under this Section shall not apply as of October 1, 2001, or such other date as provided by law, provided that Section 337.401, Florida Statutes is amended effective October 1, 2001, as set forth in Chapter 00-260, Laws of Florida, 2000. 
26-6. - REPORTS AND RECORDS. 
a.  The City may, at its option, upon sixty-(60) days notice to the Registrant, but in no event more often than once per year, examine the records and accounting files, and such other books and records, if such records relate to the calculation of fee payments or any other payments due to the City under the terms of this chapter. The examination of such books, accounts, records or other materials necessary for determination of compliance with the terms, provisions, and requirements of this chapter shall be during regular hours of business of the Registrant at an office of the Registrant located within Miami-Dade County, or at another location satisfactory to the City. In the event that the City, pursuant to an audit, determines that there exists a discrepancy in the amount paid and the amount owed to the City by the Registrant in excess of three (3%) percent, Registrant shall pay all costs, fees and expenses of the audit. Registrant shall pay interest at the rate of twelve (12%) percent per annum on the amount underpaid or not paid calculated from the date the amount was due through to the date it was finally paid. Both the underpayment and interest, and payment of any costs, fees and expenses hereunder, shall be paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of demand from the City. This Section shall not apply for periods after October 1, 2001, or such other date as provided by law, provided that Section 337.401, Florida Statutes is amended effective October 1, 2001, as set forth in Chapter 00-260, Laws of Florida, 2000.

26-7. - UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION; RELOCATION. 
a.  To the extent required by other provisions and standards of the City Code or Building regulations and not inconsistent with applicable FPSC rules and regulations, a Registrant shall install its Facilities underground. 
b.  Every Registrant which places or constructs Telecommunications Facilities underground shall maintain appropriate participation in the regional notification center for subsurface installations. 
c.  Any Telecommunications Facilities heretofore or hereafter placed under any Public Rights-of-Way that are found by the City to be unreasonably interfering in any way with the convenient, safe or continuous use or the maintenance, improvement, extension or expansion of such Public Rights-of-Way shall, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Registrant or its agent, be removed or relocated by such Registrant at its own expense except as explicitly provided under Section 337.403, Florida Statutes. The City Manager may waive or extend the time within which a Registrant shall remove or relocate a Telecommunications Facility, for good cause shown. 
d.  The Registrant shall not in any way displace, damage, or destroy any sewer, water main, pipe or any other facilities belonging to the City, or to any third party who placed such facilities therein by express authority of the City and in compliance with all of the requirements which accompany such express authority. The Registrant shall be liable to the City for the costs of any repairs made necessary by any such displacement, damage or destruction of facilities belonging to the City and the Registrant shall pay such costs upon demand. In the case of an emergency, the City may commence repairs without any prior notice to the Registrant. The term emergency shall mean a condition that may affect the public's health, safety or welfare. In the event of an emergency the City may cause the repairs to be made at the Registrant's expense, utilizing City employees, agents or contractors, charge any and all costs, plus a sum equal to ten (10%) percent of the cost against the Registrant, and require reimbursement within thirty (30) days after the submission of the bill by the City to the Registrant. In all other non-emergency circumstances, the Registrant shall be given prior written notice. If such repairs are not performed in a reasonable and satisfactory manner within the thirty (30) calendar days after receiving notice, the City may cause the repairs to be made at the Facility owner's expense, utilizing City employees, agents or contractors, charge any and all costs, plus a sum equal to ten (10%) percent of the cost against the Registrant, and require reimbursement within thirty (30) days after the submission of the bill by the City to the Registrant. 
e.  Subject to Section 337.403, Florida Statutes, whenever an order of the City requires such removal or change in the location of any Telecommunications Facility from the Public Rights-of-Way, and the Facility owner fails to remove or change the same at its own expense to conform to the order within the time stated in the notice, the City may proceed to cause the Telecommunications Facility to be removed. The expense incurred, except as provided in Section 337.403(l)(a)-(c), shall be paid out of any money available, and such expense shall be charged against the owner of the Telecommunications Facility and levied, collected and paid to the City. 
f.  Subject to Section 337.403, Florida Statutes, whenever it shall be necessary for the City to remove or relocate any Telecommunications Facility, the owner of the Telecommunications Facility, or the owner's chief agent, shall be given written notice of such removal or relocation and an order requiring the payment of the costs thereof, and shall be given reasonable time, which shall not be less than twenty (20) nor more than thirty (30) days in which to file an appeal with the City Manager to contest the reasonableness of the order. Upon receipt of a written appeal, the City Manager shall place the matter on a Council agenda for consideration within forty-five (45) working days. Should the owner or the owner's representative not appear, the determination of the cost to the owner shall be final, in accordance with Section 337.404, Florida Statutes. 
g.  Pursuant to Section 337.404(2), F.S., a final order of the City shall constitute a lien on any property of the owner and may be enforced by filing an authenticated copy of the order in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the County wherein the owner's property is located. 
h.  The City retains the right and privilege to cut or move any Facilities located within the Public Rights-of-Way of the City, as the City Manager in the exercise of reasonable discretion may determine to be necessary or appropriate in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the City shall attempt to notify the owner of the Facility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a Facility and shall notify the owner of the Facility, if known, after cutting or removing a Facility. 
i.  Upon cessation of use of a facility within the Public Rights-of-Way of the City, the owner of the Facility shall notify the City within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice, the City may direct the Facility owner to remove all or any portion of the Facility if the City determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the City does not direct the removal of the abandoned Facility by the owner of the Facility, such owner, by its notice of cessation of use to the City, shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the Facility by the City, another utility or person. 
j.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a Facility owner agrees to provide the City, within thirty (30) days of filing or receipt of such, or within ten (10) days of determining its relevance hereto, any document that may prevent compliance with the requirements of a permit in connection with the installation, construction or maintenance of its Facilities, or use of Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. This obligation shall only extend to such work in the Public Right-of-Way for which a Facility owner has applied for, or obtained a permit from the City. 
(Ord. No. 2000-13 § 26-7, 12-19-00) 
26-8. - USE OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY. 
a.  A Facility owner agrees at all times to comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the State statutes and local laws including, but not limited to, applicable zoning regulations not inconsistent with State and Federal laws. 
b.  Except in the case of an emergency, which shall include without limitation an out of service condition affecting 911 service, and which shall require subsequent notification to the City, no Telecommunications Service Provider shall construct any Facility under or within any Public Right-of-Way which disrupts the Public Rights-of-Way without first filing an application with and obtaining a permit from the City, pursuant to applicable permitting requirements of the City except as otherwise provided in this chapter. In case of the repair or maintenance of an existing Facility, the City may impose lesser requirements than those set forth herein. Unless otherwise required by the City Code, no permit shall be required for installation and maintenance of service connections to customers' premises where there will be no disruption of the Public Rights-of-Way. 
c.  As part of any permit application, the Facility owner shall provide a proposal for construction of the Telecommunications Facility that sets forth at least the following: 
1.  The location of the proposed Facility, including a description of the feet of plant to be installed, where it is to be located, and the approximate size of Facilities and equipment that will be located in the Public Rights-Of-Way. 
2.  A description of the manner in which the System will be installed (i.e. anticipated construction methods and/or techniques), the time required to construct the System, a maintenance of traffic plan for any disruption of the Public Rights-of-Way, including information on the ability of the Public Rights-of-Way to accommodate the proposed System, if available (such information shall be provided without certification as to correctness, to the extent obtained from other users of the Public Rights-of-Way). Also, if appropriate given the System proposed, an estimate of the cost of restoration to the Public Rights-of-Way. Such plan shall include the timetable for construction for each phase of the project, and the areas of the City which will be affected. 
d.  The City may request such additional information as it finds reasonably necessary to review an application for a permit to perform work in the Public Rights-of-Way. The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the Public Rights-of-Way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of permittees to occupy and use the Public Rights-of-Way. The City shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Public Rights-of-Way, but may prohibit or limit placement of new or additional facilities in any Public Rights-of Way, for the protection of existing facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way, or which may reasonably conflict with identified future City plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined by the City to be in the public interest. 
e.  All Facilities shall be installed, located and maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the Public Rights-of-Way by the public and to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the Public Rights-of-Way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way as well as joint trenching and/or the co-location of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever feasible. The City Manager may promulgate such rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of a Telecommunications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way, as may be consistent with this chapter and other applicable Law. 
f.  All safety practices required by applicable Law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during construction, maintenance, and repair of the Telecommunications Facilities. 
g.  In the event that at any time during the term of the rights granted herein the City shall lawfully elect to alter, or change the grade of, any Public Rights-of-Way, upon reasonable notice by the City, the Facility owner shall make any necessary removals, relaying and relocation of its Telecommunications Facilities at its own expense, in accordance with applicable Law. 
h.  A Facility owner shall obtain any and all required permits and pay any and all required fees before commencing any construction on or otherwise disturbing any Public Rights-of-Way as a result of its construction, except as provided herein or otherwise allowed by the City. The Facility owner shall, at its own expense, restore such property to as good a condition as existed prior to commencement of work. If such restoration is not performed in a reasonable and satisfactory manner to the City within thirty (30) calendar days after the completion of construction, the City may, after prior written notice to Registrant, cause the repairs to be made at the Facility owner's expense utilizing City employees, agents or contractors, charge any and all costs, plus a sum equal to ten (10%) percent of the cost against the Registrant, and require reimbursement within thirty (30) days after the submission of the bill by the City of Registrant. A permit from the City constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities on Public Rights-of-Way in accordance with this chapter, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the Public Rights-of-Way. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City from negotiating with a Facility owner for the installation of a City conduit in any open trench that may be permitted, or prohibit a Facility owner from exercising its rights under 47 U.S.C. Section 224. 
i.  All ongoing installation, construction and maintenance of a Telecommunications Facility located in the Public Rights-of-Way shall be subject to the City's periodic inspection, upon no less than three (3) days written notice to the Facility owner, for compliance with this chapter, or any applicable provisions of the City Code and/or Administrative Regulations. 
j.  A Facility owner shall not place its Facilities so as to interfere unreasonably with any other person lawfully using the Public Rights-of-Way of the City. 
k.  A Facility Owner shall cooperate with the City by providing timely and complete information requested under this subparagraph. Upon completion of any installation or construction of new facilities in Public Rights-of-Way, at no cost to the City, the Facility Owner shall provide such information, as may be requested, showing the exact location of its facilities and structures, including but not limited to, as-built plans, maps, geographical information systems, plats, construction documents, drawings and any other information the City may find reasonably necessary. Such plans shall be provided in digitized format showing the two-dimensional location of the Facilities based on the City's Geographical Database datums, or other format acceptable to the City Manager. Any proprietary confidential information, as defined in Section 202.195, F.S., which is obtained by the City from a Registrant pursuant to the terms of this chapter or other applicable provisions of the City Code, shall only be used by the City for the purposes allowed by Section 202.195, F.S. and shall, to the extent provided therein, be exempt from disclosure by the City under the provisions of Chapter 119, F.S. If in connection with a proposed installation of Facilities by any Registrant or the City or any contemplated municipal or other government related construction project in a particular area of City Rights-of-Way, the City requires additional information concerning the location of a Registrant's existing facilities in that area, then the registrant shall provide such plans indicating such information to the City following the City's request therefore. In the case of contemplated construction projects in a particular area, the facility owner shall, as reasonably practical, provide such information at no cost to the City, as may be requested, showing the exact location of its facilities and structures in such area, including but not limited to as-built plans, maps, geographical information systems, plats, construction documents, drawings and other information the City may find reasonably necessary. 
l.  Suspension and/or Revocation of Permits. Subject to Subsection m. below, the City Manager or a designee may issue a stop work notice, temporarily suspend or permanently revoke a permit for work in the Public Rights-of-Way for one or more of the following reasons: 
1.  violation of permit conditions, including conditions set forth in this chapter or other applicable provisions of the City Code or regulations governing use of Public Rights-of-Way; or 
2.  misrepresentation or fraud by Registrant in a permit application to the City; 
3.  failure to relocate or remove facilities as may be lawfully required by the City; 
4.  failure of Registrant, its employees, agents or subcontractors to (a) place barricades or signs around the work area, (b) take reasonable safety precautions to alert the public of work at the work site, or (c) repair, replace and restore any sidewalk, street, alley, pavement, water, sewer or other utility line or appurtenance, soil, landscaping, dirt or other improvement, property or structure of any nature. In the event of such failure, the City may perform the work utilizing City employees, agents or contractors, charge any and all costs, plus a sum equal to ten (10%) percent of the cost against the Registrant, and require reimbursement within thirty (30) days after the submission of the bill by the City to Registrant. 
m.  Where appropriate, at the discretion of the City Manager or designee, and consistent with other City regulations and procedures, notice and reasonable opportunity to cure shall be provided to Registrant prior to the revocation of a permit. Final, written decisions of the City revoking a permit or denying an application for a Registration are subject to appeal. An appeal must be filed with the City within thirty (30) days of the date of the final, written decisions to be appealed. Any appeal not timely filed as set forth above shall be waived. The City Council shall hear the appeal no later than forty five (45) days from the end of the thirty (30) day appeal period, unless waived by the Registrant and shall issue a written decision within thirty (30) days thereafter. Upon correction of any violation that gave rise to a suspension or denial of permit, the suspension or denial shall be lifted. 
n.  In the event Registrant desires to use its existing facilities or to construct new facilities for the purpose of providing other utility or non-utility services to existing or potential consumers or resellers, by providing cable services, or any other services other than the provision of telecommunications service, or for providing any other use to existing or potential consumers, a Registrant shall seek such additional and separate authorization from City for such activities as may require by applicable law. In the event that a Registrant is acting in its proprietary function as a retail provider of telecommunications equipment or appliances, Registrant shall seek the appropriate permits and licenses from the City. 
o.  To the extent that any person or a Registrant leases or otherwise uses the facilities of an entity that is duly registered or otherwise authorized to place and maintain facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way of the City, the person or Registrant shall make no claim, nor assert any right, which will impede the lawful exercise of the City's rights, including requiring the removal of such facilities from the Public Rights-of-Way of the City, regardless of the effect on Registrant's ability to maintain its own telecommunications facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way of the City. 
p.  Involuntary Termination of Registration. The involuntary termination of a registration may only be accomplished by an action of the City Council. The City may declare the registration terminated and revoke and cancel all privileges granted under that registration if (a) a Federal or State authority suspends, denies, or revokes a Registrant's certification to provide telecommunications service, (b) the Registrant's use of the Public Right-of-Way presents an extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the Right-of-Way, or (c) the Registrant abandons all its facilities in the City's Rights-of Way. Prior to such termination by the City resulting from a violation of any of the provisions of this subparagraph, the Registrant shall be notified by the City Manager with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to such violation, and describing the action of the City with respect thereto. The Registrant shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice within which to cure the violation, or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the City Council, to accomplish the same. In the event of such termination, the Registrant shall, within a reasonable time following such termination, remove or abandon the facilities and take such steps as are necessary to render every portion of the facilities remaining within the Public Right-of-Way of the City safe. If the Registrant has either abandoned its facilities or chooses to abandon its facilities, the City may either (1) require the Registrant's bonding company to remove some or all of the facilities from the Public Right-of-Way and restore the Public Right-of-Way to its proper condition or (2) the City may require that some or all of the facilities be removed and the Public Right-of-Way restored to its proper condition at the Registrant's expense, utilizing City employees, agents or contractors, and charge any and all costs, plus a sum equal to ten (10%) percent of the cost against the Registrant, and require reimbursement. The obligations of the Registrant hereunder shall survive the termination of the registration. In the event of a termination of registration, this provision does not permit the City to cause the removal of any facilities that are used to provide another service for which the Registrant holds a valid certification with the governing Federal and State telecommunications agencies and is properly registered with the City, for such certificated service, under this chapter.

This provision includes, but is not limited to, the City's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings, claims arising out of copyright infringements or a failure by the Registrant to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or providers of Telecommunications Services, and claims against the Registrant for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right of any person, firm, or corporation. City agrees to notify the Registrant, in writing, within a reasonable time of City receiving notice, of any issue it determines may require indemnification.

d.  Failure of the City to enforce any requirements of this chapter shall not constitute a waiver of the City's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies. 
e.
