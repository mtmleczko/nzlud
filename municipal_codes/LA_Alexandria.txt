PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Alexandria, Louisiana of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations setting forth their location within the Code volume is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 2 is 2-2. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-2 and 4-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-2.1, 4-2.2 and 4-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 7 and 8 it will be designated as Chapter 7.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and B. Meade White of the editorial staff of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

(a)  By contract or by municipal personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council.

(2)  Within five (5) days after an official, officer or employee is served with any summons, complaint, process notice, demand or pleading, he shall deliver the original or a copy thereof to the city attorney. Failure to make the required delivery under this section to the city attorney shall preclude indemnification hereof. Upon delivery to the city attorney, the city attorney shall within five (5) days furnish a copy of the summons, complaint, process, notice, demand, or pleading to the mayor and council president. Upon such delivery, the city attorney shall assume control of the defense of the official, officer, or employee, unless:

d.  After a thorough investigation, it appears that representation of the officer or employee would conflict with the representation of another officer or employee of the city. In case of such conflict, the city attorney shall secure special counsel to represent the officer or employee at city expense but in no event does this abrogate the employee's or officer's rights in subsection (2). 
(3)  In any case where the city attorney does not undertake the representation of the officer or employee he may take such action as he deems necessary including enrolling as cocounsel, to protect the interest of the city. 
(4)  The decision of the city attorney not to defend an officer or employee and any and all information obtained by him as a result of the investigation conducted pursuant to subsections (2)c and d shall be considered confidential and shall not be admissible as evidence in any legal proceeding and no reference thereto shall be made in any trial or hearing.

However, the city shall not be obligated to indemnify said individual for the attorney's fees so incurred except as provided in subsection (2)c of this section. 
(7)  The benefits of this section shall [insure] only to the official, officer, or employee of the city or, upon the death of the affected official, officer, or employee, to his legal, instituted or irregular heirs, subject to the community rights of surviving spouse, which, however, shall not enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party. 
(c)  Within five (5) days after any lawsuit is served on the city, a original or a copy thereof shall be delivered to the city attorney. Upon delivery to the city attorney, the city attorney shall within five (5) days furnish a copy of the summons, complaint, process, notice, demand, or pleading to the mayor and council president. Upon such delivery, the city attorney shall assume control of the defense of the lawsuit, unless: 
(1)  The city is covered by a policy of insurance under the terms of which the insurance carrier is required to provide counsel and the insurance carrier does in fact provide a defense for the full extent of the claim against the city; or 
(2)  The city attorney reports on the nature and substance of the lawsuit to the city council and feels that special legal counsel shall be employed by the city, which counsel shall be approved by the city council and hired by written contract approved by the city council.

--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 312-2007, § 1, adopted Nov. 6, 2007, amended the title of Art. III to read herein as set out. 

Sec. 10-35. - Legislative findings of fact. 
    The City Council of the City of Alexandria finds: 
(1)  That in prior and recent years, small businesses, including but not limited to minorities and women, were effectively denied the opportunity for full and equal participation in city purchases of goods and commodities; 
(2)  That the opportunity for full and equal participation by such entities is essential in order to promote, obtain, and maintain economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our local economy, capitalizing on diversity and creating broader sustainability by expanding industry and business in central Louisiana; 
(3)  That such conditions can be improved by providing the equal opportunity for the development of the business concerns owned by small business persons, minority persons, and women; 
(4)  That such development can be materially advanced through the procurement by the city of articles, equipment, supplies, and materials from such concerns; 
(5)  That such procurements also benefit the city by encouraging the expansion of business, thereby creating jobs and promoting economic opportunities for the citizenry which may not have existed prior to such diverse procurements and service requirements; 
(6)  That if gross statistical disparities exist in Alexandria, this constitutes a legislative finding that specific disparity studies are needed and shall be authorized forthwith to determine proof of a pattern or practice of institutional or actual discrimination in order to substantiate and/or develop a community-based picture; 
(7)  That the city should determine when and under what circumstances special qualifications are required to fill particular needs for full and equal participation in city purchases of goods and commodities and for promotion of job inclusion; 
(8)  That the city finds programming to increase job diversity must follow constitutional circumscriptions and should compare jobs regarding which individuals possess the necessary qualifications in the Alexandria economy to the general population of Alexandria, the State of Louisiana and nationwide; 
(9)  That racial and gender disparity should whenever practicable be based upon comparisons, when considering entry-level positions (positions requiring minimal training), of the racial and gender composition of the relevant population to the general population; 
(10)  That racial and gender disparity should whenever practicable be based upon different comparisons when considering positions requiring special qualifications. These comparisons should address the relevant statistical pool for purposes of demonstrating exclusion of ready, willing, and able minorities or women (the number of minorities or women qualified to undertake the particular task) to the general population of similarly-situated ready, willing, and able persons of the specific population who are not minority or women; 
(11)  That the city shall determine the number of qualified minority businesses and potential job holders within the limited jurisdiction using reliable, generally-accepted disparity and identification testing prior to the city requiring race-conscious goals, but that "aspirational" goals (including race-conscious as a non-predominant factor) and race-neutral means shall be developed with this ordinance. It shall be the policy of the city to ensure, in addition to addressing specifically minorities and women (or disadvantaged or challenged business, opportunity is made available to small business concerns, generally, in the letting of contracts and purchases. At no time until the completion of a disparity study shall any city department or representative exclude any responsive bidder from participation in, deny any person the benefits of, or otherwise discriminate against anyone in connection with, the awarding and performance of any contract or purchase on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin; 
(12)  That the city shall provide programs and services designed to assist businesses within its jurisdiction or substantially connected to such jurisdiction as defined by this ordinance. The city shall promote programs and services to assist small and disadvantaged business concerns in the development and growth of their businesses, including through incubators or other business growth mechanisms, both private and quasi-public, as the case may be. City departments shall take measures to evaluate and ensure optimum contracting and purchasing opportunities are made available; 
(13)  That the city shall determine in its disparity and identification testing the barriers which may have an adverse impact upon small disadvantaged businesses and their ability to participate in all city-let contracts and purchases. Contractors shall be required to participate in this endeavor and at no time shall they discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex in the award and performance of any city-let contract or purchase; and 
(14)  That the city shall implement a plan that will specify these intents through the office of the mayor, workforce development and small business retention (or the mayoral designee for such programming), to specify goals as required by any responsible federal agency for federally funded contracts/purchases and compliance requirements, any state equivalent thereto, together with the city's goals for all city-let contracts/purchases. This plan shall be applicable to the city and its contractors with reference to their subcontracting and supply needs. The city and its contractors and subcontractors will make a good faith effort to meet stated goals.

Sec. 10-36. - Title. 
    The provisions within these ordinances shall constitute and be known as the "Small and Emerging Business Development Program" for the City of Alexandria. This program shall encompass several components, including: 
(1)  The "Alexandria Fairness, Equality, Accessibility and Teamwork" Program ("A.F.E.A.T"); 
(2)  The "Alexandria Bonding Assistance" Program ("A.B.A."); and

Sec. 10-36.1. - Purpose. 
    The purposes are: 
(1)  To promote the competitive viability of small business, minority, and women business enterprise by providing contract, technical, educational, and management assistance;

To determine whether such contracting disparities exist, the city would solicit proposals and qualifications from qualified service providers. A disparity study can, and should, be useful in providing the City of Alexandria with evidence, in accord with the current changes in law and particularly the precedent of the United States Supreme Court in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson (1989) and Adarand v. Pena (1995), to modify such policies and goals of the City of Alexandria since those landmark decisions and any future ones, to determine whether or not, and to what extent, remedial programs for racial or gender discrimination are appropriate. A disparity study will determine if the City of Alexandria has up-to-date facts for existing and future efforts to increase the use of minority- and women-owned businesses. 
    Dominant in its field of operation means those businesses exercising a controlling or major influence in a business activity in which a number of businesses are engaged.

    Dominant in its field of operation, affiliate or subsidiary of a business means those affiliates or subsidiaries of businesses of which at least twenty (20) percent is owned by a business dominant in that field of operation, or by partners, officers, directors, majority shareholders, or their equivalent of a business dominant in that field of operation. 
    Financial intermediary means a financial intermediary is an institution, firm, or individual who performs some form of intermediation between two (2) or more parties in a financial context, meaning specifically, but not limited to, facilitation of the channeling of funds between lenders and borrowers through indirect means. A lender may lend funds to an intermediary, typically a banking institution, under certain limitations so that the institution, firm, or individual as the case may be can allocate the funds to borrowers under strict guidance and rules. 
    Good faith effort means an honest and genuine attempt to comply with the terms, goals and objectives of this program as provided for in this article and as specifically provided for in each contract for the purchase of goods by the City of Alexandria. 
    Goods and services means personal property of every description and all work, except work performed by full-time employees of the city, performed for the city, excluding construction and work performed by professionals.

    Minority, business enterprise or minority owned business means the business shall be at least fifty-one (51) percent owned and controlled in both form and substance by one (1) or more minorities. Only businesses who are independently owned/operated, not dominant in their field of operation, meet the Small Business Administration's definition of a small business concern as determine by the U.S. Small Business Administration's Small Business Size Standards and which are registered by the city will be allowed to participate in and benefit from this program. 
    North American Industry Classification System Codes (NAICS) 2007 means [a system] used by business and government to classify and measure economic activity.

    Person means any person, partnership, firm, corporation, association, limited liability company, joint-venture, or other Louisiana recognized juridical entities. 
    Preference means a technique which gives an advantage in consideration of bids and proposals to those submitted by minority business enterprise or women business enterprise, to the extent allowed by law as such controlling law may be amended or changed as legislated or interpreted by controlling precedent of a final authority. 
    Professional service providers means those persons who provide technical or professional services within the municipal jurisdiction whose services are exempt from the Louisiana Public Works Act or bid laws, such as but not limited to, engineers, accountants, architects, attorneys, security providers, and medical practitioners. 
    Reservation means a technique which limits consideration of bids and proposals to those regulations and requirements as may from time to time be instituted by this article and state law. 
    Significant local presence means a presence such that a substantial amount of business is done within the metropolitan statistical area ("MSA") of Alexandria by: (i) location of a satellite office within the MSA or fifty-mile radius, employing three (3) or more full-time employees in twenty (20) or more calendar weeks per year; or (ii) maintaining a principal business establishment ("PBE") within the MSA or fifty-mile radius; or (iii) real and substantial commitment, represented by cooperative endeavor with the City of Alexandria, to locate a PBE or satellite within the MSA. This presence is also satisfied by having successfully bid on and completed substantial projects in the past, without the aid of the small and emerging business program. 
    Socially or economically disadvantaged person means a person who has been deprived of the opportunity to develop and maintain a competitive position in the economy because of social or economic disadvantage. This disadvantage may arise from cultural, social or economic circumstances or background or physical location. 
    U.S. Small Business Administration's Small Business Size Standards means a table that lists small business size standards matched to industries described in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as modified by the office of management and budget in 2007. The size standards are mostly expressed in either millions of dollars or number of employees. A size standard is the largest that a for-profit concern can be and still qualify as a small business. 
    Women business enterprise or women owned business means a small business that is at least fifty-one (51) percent owned by a woman or women who also control and operate it. "Control" in this context means exercising the power to make policy decisions. "Operate" in this context means being actively involved in the day-to-day management. In determining whether a business is fifty-one (51) percent owned by a woman or women, the percent ownership of the woman or women shall not be diminished because she is part of a community property regime. 
(Ord. No. 98-1988, § 1, 5-17-88; Ord. No. 312-2007, § 1, 11-6-07)

State Law reference- Source, R.S. 14:7. 
Sec. 15-8. - Criminal conduct. 
    Criminal conduct consists of: 
(1)  An act or a failure to act that produces criminal consequences, and which is combined with criminal intent; or

Sec. 15-9. - Criminal consequences.

State Law reference- Source, R.S. 14:9. 
Sec. 15-10. - Criminal intent. 
    Criminal intent may be specific or general: 
(1)  Specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. 
(2)  General criminal intent is present whenever there is specific intent, and also when the circumstances indicate that the offender, in the ordinary course of human experience, must have adverted to the prescribed criminal consequences as reasonably certain to result from his act or failure to act. 
State Law reference- Source, R.S. 14:10. 
Sec. 15-11. - Criminal intent; how expressed. 
    The definitions of some offense require a specific criminal intent, while in others no intent is required. Some offenses consist merely of criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences.

State Law reference- Source, R.S. 14:11. 
Sec. 15-12. - Criminal negligence. 
    Criminal negligence exists when, although neither specific nor general criminal intent is present, there is such disregard of the interest of others that the offender's conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful man under like circumstances.

(1)  Where the production of the intoxicated or drugged condition has been involuntary, and the circumstances indicate this condition is the direct cause of the commission of the offense, the offender is exempt from responsibility. 
(2)  Where the circumstances indicate that an intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the presence of a specific intent or of special knowledge required in a particular offense, this fact constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that offense.

Sec. 15-18. - Mistake of fact. 
    Unless there is a provision to the contrary in the definition of an offense, reasonable ignorance of fact or mistake of fact which precludes the presence of any mental element required in that offense is a defense to any prosecution for that offense.

State Law reference- Source, R.S. 14:17.

(2)  When the offender's conduct is a reasonable accomplishment of an arrest which is lawful; or 
(3)  When for any reason the offender's conduct is authorized by law or ordinance; or 
(4)  When the offender's conduct is reasonable discipline of minors by their parents, tutors, or teachers; or 
(5)  When the offense consists of a failure to perform an affirmative duty and the failure to perform is caused by physical impossibility; or 
(6)  When any offense is committed through the compulsion of threats by another of death or great bodily harm, and the offender reasonably believes the person making the threats is present and would immediately carry out the threats if the offense were not committed; or 
(7)  When the offender's conduct is in defense of persons or of property under any of the circumstances described in sections 15-17 through 15-19.

(b)  Mere preparation to commit an offense shall not be sufficient to constitute an attempt; but lying in wait with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit an offense, or searching for the intended victim with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit an offense, shall be sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit the offense intended. 
(c)  An attempt is a separate but lesser grade of the intended offense; and any person may be convicted of an attempt to commit an offense, although it appears on the trial that the offense intended or attempted was actually perpetrated by such person in pursuance of such attempt.

a.  Fire protection systems consist of sprinklers, hose connections, and hydrants. Sprinkler systems may be dry or wet, open or closed. Systems consisting of fixed-spray nozzles may be used indoors or outdoors for protection of flammable-liquid and other hazardous processes. It is standard practice, especially in cities, to equip automatic sprinkler systems with fire department pumper connections. 
b.  A meter (compound, detector check) shall not be permitted as part of a backflow prevention assembly, unless the meter and backflow prevention assembly are specifically designed for that purpose. 
c.  For cross connection control, fire protection systems shall be classified on the basis of water source and arrangement of supplies as follows: 
1.  Class 1: Direct connections from public water mains only; no pumps, tanks or reservoirs; no physical connection from other water supplies; no antifreeze or other additives of any kind; all sprinkler drains discharging to atmosphere, dry wells or other safe outlets. 
2.  Class 2: Same as class 1, except that booster pumps may be installed in the connections from the street mains. It is required to avoid drafting to the extent that pressure in the water main is reduced below twenty (20) psi. 
3.  Class 3: Direct connection from public water supply main plus one (1) or more of the following: elevated storage tanks; fire pumps taking suction from above-ground covered reservoirs or tanks; and pressure tanks (all storage facilities are filled or connected to public water only, the water in the tanks to be maintained in a potable condition). 
4.  Class 4: Directly supplied from public mains similar to classes 1 and 2, and with an auxiliary water supply on or available to the premises, or an auxiliary supply may be located within one thousand seven hundred (1,700) feet of the pumper connection. Class 4 systems will require backflow protection at the service connection. The type (air gap or reduced pressure) will depend on the quality of the auxiliary supply. 
5.  Class 5: Directly supplied from public mains, and interconnected with auxiliary supplies, such as: pumps taking suction from reservoirs exposed to contamination, or rivers and ponds; driven wells, mills or other industrial water systems; or where antifreeze or other additives are used. Class 5 systems require maximum protection (air gap or reduced pressure) to protect the public water system. 
6.  Class 6: Combined industrial and fire protection systems supplied from the public water mains only, with or without gravity storage or pump suction suction tanks. Class 6 system protection depends on the requirements of both industry and fire protection, and shall be determined by a survey of the premises. 
(2)  Installation of assembly. When a backflow prevention assembly is required for a water service connection supplying water only to a fire system, the assembly shall be installed on the service line in compliance with standard specifications adopted by the city. (Installation of DCVAs or DDCVAs in a vertical position on the riser may be allowed on fire systems with the plumbing inspector's approval.)

Sec. 26-89.1. - Large industrial services rates. 
(a)  Availability : Electric service is available under this schedule at points on the utility's primary distribution or transmission system where facilities of adequate capacity and suitable phase and voltage are adjacent to the property to be served. 
(b)  Applicability : This rate is applicable for general service or industrial customers served through a single metering installation whose monthly kilowatt demands are not less than five thousand (5,000) kw in any month within the most current twelve-month period including the current month. Should kw demand for each of the most recent twelve (12) months prior to expiration of the electric service agreement be less than five thousand (5,000) kw, the large power service customer shall return to the medium industrial services rate upon expiration of the electric service agreement. No resale, breakdown, standby, or auxiliary service is permitted. Customer must contract for not less than five thousand (5,000) kw of electric service under terms of an electric service agreement. 
(c)  Character of service : Service furnished under this rate shall be three-phase, 60-cycle, alternating current at a prevailing voltage, selected at the option of the utility. At the utility's option, investment in substation, line and associated facilities needed to deliver service to the customer may be recovered through a monthly facilities charge as determined in the electric service agreement. 
(d)  Rate per month: 
Customer service charge $500.00 Billing demand charge (all kw) 5.50 per kw Energy charge (all kwh) 0.0063 per kwh Monthly facilities charge Per electric service agreement  
(e)  Supply cost adjustment charge : The above rates shall be adjusted in accordance with the supply cost adjustment clause as follows: 
    All kwh rates for metered and unmetered sales will be increased by an amount equal to 1.055 times the product of the utility transfer factor times the average cost per kwh(¢/kwh) for net generation and purchased power cost (determined as the sum of the fuel cost of city generation and the utility's total purchased power, energy, and delivery costs (excluding LEPA costs for: administrative and general, debt service, project renewal and replacement, and interest earnings (credit)) for the second month preceding the current billing. In addition, all kwh rates will be increased or decreased for each subsequent fiscal year by an amount equal to the annual adjustment. The annual adjustment shall be equal to the sum of the actual costs determined above less the amount billed to customers for recovery of such costs for each fiscal year ending April 30, with such sum divided by total metered sales for such time period. 
    The net monthly charge or credit will be calculated based on the following formula: 
SCA = 1.055 × T × (S/I) + A 
Where: 
SCA = Supply cost adjustment, expressed in $/kwh, for the current billing month and applied to all metered kwh sales to retail customers of the electric distribution department. 
1.055 = Retail sales loss factor to adjust system supply costs at input for retail system distribution energy losses. 
T = Utility transfer factor to collect annual transfers to the city associated with SCA revenues collected. 
S = Total system supply costs of the electric department as defined above for the second month preceding the current month, expressed in $. 
I = Total system input energy associated with S for the second month preceding the current month, expressed in kwh. 
A = Annual adjustment as defined above, expressed in $ per kwh. 
(f)  Determination of billing demand : Billing demand shall be the highest fifteen-minute measured integrated kilowatt demand in the month. For determining the kilowatt demand charge in any month, the kilowatt demand shall be the maximum demand in the month, but not less than eighty (80) per cent of the highest demand during the preceding twelve (12) months. The minimum billing demand shall be five thousand (5,000) kw per month or eighty (80) per cent of the contract demand whichever is greater. Contract demand shall be defined in the electric service agreement and shall not be less than five thousand (5,000) kw. 
(g)  Power factor clause : Consumers shall at all times take and use power in such a manner that the power factor shall be as nearly one hundred (100) per cent as practicable. When the average power factor as determined by continuous measurement of lagging reactive kilovolt ampere hours is less than ninety (90) per cent, the billing demand may be determined by multiplying the maximum demand shown by the demand meter for the billing period by ninety (90) and dividing the product thus obtained by the actual average power factor expressed in per cent. The utility may, at its option, use for adjustment the power factor as determined by tests during a period of normal operation of the consumer's equipment instead of the average power factor. 
(h)  Primary metering: This rate applies to service metered at secondary voltage supplied through a step-down transformer owned by the utility. At the option of the utility, metering may be installed at the high voltage side of the utility owned step-down transformer, in which event, one and one-half (11/2) per cent shall be subtracted from the kw demand, kvar demand and kwh energy readings to adjust them to the secondary voltage level for billing purposes. 
(i)  Facilities charge : The facilities charge shall be expressed in dollars per month. At the utility's option, investment in substation, line, and associated facilities needed to provide service shall be recovered through the facilities charge. Such charge shall be agreed upon between the utility and customer based on the cost of the facilities and the anticipated annual charges required. Such agreement shall be in writing and made part of the electric service agreement. 
(j)  Electric service agreement : Large industrial service rates are available to customers that have entered into an electric service agreement with the utility. Such an agreement shall have a term of not less than three (3) years. 
(k)  Minimum monthly charge : The minimum monthly charge shall be the customer service charge, plus the billing demand charge, plus the facilities charge. 
(l)  Delayed payment charge: The total net amount based upon the net rates specified herein is due when the bill is received. After fifteen (15) days from the date of the bill, the gross amount is due. The gross amount of the bill will be determined by adding ten (10) per cent of the net amount. 
(m)  Terms and conditions : All electric service rendered hereunder is subject to the utility's rules, terms, and conditions. 
(n)  Infrastructure renewal assessment. From May 1, 2012 until this subsection is amended after a subsequent final, approved and implemented rate reform or April 30, 2015 there is imposed for electrical service to all general service or industrial customers, who are subject to this section, located inside the city limits and to general service industrial customers located outside the city limits, a monthly electrical service infrastructure renewal assessment:

(ii)  Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions). 
(iii)  Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works. 
(iv)  Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting "slugs," as defined herein. 
(12)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or which are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
    No person shall dilute their waste discharge (in lieu of treatment or removal) to reduce the concentration of any of the above parameters to levels below the concentrations stated in this chapter. 
(e)  If any waters or wastes are discharged that contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in paragraph (d) of this section, the industry or persons responsible are subject to the penalties outlined in EPA guidelines. In the judgment of the superintendent, [in the event] any wastes may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes or equipment, or constitute a public nuisance, the superintendent may: 
(1)  Require pretreatment to reduce the levels of the deleterious substances to acceptable amounts; 
(2)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
(3)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of paragraph (j) of this section. 
If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the city engineer and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(f)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that any such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. The proper operation of these interceptors shall be the responsibility of the property owner(s) and failure to maintain them in proper working order shall be cause for discontinuance of sewer and/or water service. 
(g)  Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
(h)  When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate continuous observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(i)  All measurement, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.) 
(j)  No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing an agreement or arrangement between the city and industrial concern whereby an industrial waste that is not prohibited by EPA and/or state regulations such as those outlined in paragraph (d), may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern. Payment by the industry shall include cost recovery for construction, operation and maintenance of the increment of the waste water treatment facilities required to treat the waste water discharge of the industry. Costs to be considered shall include: 
(1)  Amortization of the indebtedness for the cost of the treatment facilities (plant and interceptor sewers); 
(2)  Operation and maintenance of the treatment facilities; and 
(3)  Any additional costs which are necessary to assure adequate treatment on a continuous basis.

An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c) are met. 
(c)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  An industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance; 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Ord. No. 121-2013, 6-25-2013) 
Sec. 27.5-97. - General/specific prohibitions. 
    An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 27.5-24 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges for other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 121-2013, 6-25-2013) 
Sec. 27.5-98. - Bypass. 
(a)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
(b)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(c)  An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but not only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section. 
(d)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass. 
(e)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(f)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2)  There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(3)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. 
(g)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (d) of this section.

ARTICLE IV. - STORM WATER DISCHARGES FROM CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES 

Sec. 29-71. - General requirements. 
    The operator shall certify all state requirements have been met by signing a certification statement as part of the grading application and/or building permit application. Refer to current specific NPDES permit for site applicability and NOI requirements. 
(1)  All operators of construction sites shall use best management practices to control and reduce the discharge, to the MS4 and to waters of the United States, of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other material associated with the clearing, grading, excavation, and other construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. Such best management practices may include, but not be limited to, the following measures: 
(a)  Ensuring that existing vegetation is preserved where feasible and that disturbed portions of the site are stabilized as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased. Stabilization measures may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation, and other appropriate measures; 
(b)  Use of structural practices to divert flows from exposed soils, store flows, or otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from the site to the extent feasible; 
(c)  Minimization of the tracking of sediments off-site by vehicles, the generation of dust, and the escape of other windblown waste from the site; 
(d)  Prevention of the discharge of building materials, including cement, lime, concrete, and mortar, to the MS4 or waters of the United States; 
(e)  Providing general good housekeeping measures to prevent and contain spills of paints, solvents, fuels, septic waste, and other hazardous chemicals and pollutants associated with construction, and to assure proper clean and disposal of any such spills in compliance with state, federal, and local requirements; 
(f)  Implementation of proper waste disposal and waste management techniques, including covering waste materials and minimizing ground contact with hazardous chemicals and trash; 
(g)  Timely maintenance of vegetation, erosion and sediment control measures and other best management practices in good and effective operating condition; and 
(h)  Installation of structural measures during the construction process to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed. Structural measures should be placed on upland soils to the degree attainable. Such installed structural measures may include, but not be limited to, the following: stormwater detention structures (including wet ponds); flow attenuation by use of open vegetative swales and natural depressions; other velocity dissipation devices, infiltration of runoff on site; and sequential systems which combine several practices. Operators of construction sites are only responsible for the installation and maintenance of stormwater management measures prior to final stabilization of the site, and are not responsible for maintenance after stormwater discharges associated with construction activity have terminated. 
(2)  Personnel (provided by the operator of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas of any construction site (meeting criteria of current NPDES permit) that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site in accordance with the current NPDES permit. All erosion and sediment control measures and other identified best management practices shall be observed in order to ensure that they are operating correctly and are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters and the MS4. Based on the results of the inspections, best management practices shall be revised as appropriate, and as soon as is practicable. 
(3)  The city may require any plans and specification that are prepared for the construction of site improvements to illustrate and describe the best management practices required by subsection (1)(a) above that will be implemented at the construction site. The city may deny approval of any building permit, site development plan, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, on the grounds that the management practices described in the plans or observed upon the site inspection by the city are determined not to control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with clearing, grading, excavation, and other construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. 
(4)  Any owner of a site of construction activity, whether or not he/she is an operator, is jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the requirements in this section. 
(5)  Any contractor or subcontractor on a site of construction activity, who is not an owner or operator, but who is responsible under his/her contract or subcontract for implementing best management practices control measure, is jointly and severally responsible for any willful or negligent failure on his/her part to adequately implement that control measure if such failure causes or contributes to causing the city to violate a water quality standard, the city's NPDES permit, or any state-issued discharge permit for discharges from its MS4. 
(6)  Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection (2), the site description and/or the pollution prevention measures shall be revised as appropriate, but in no case later than one (1) calendar day following the inspection. Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWPPP within one (1) calendar day following the inspection. 
(7)  Upon final stabilization of the construction site, the owner or the duly authorized representative thereof, shall submit written certification to the city that the site has been finally stabilized. The city may withhold an occupancy or use permit for any premises constructed on the site until certification of final stabilization has been filed and the city has determined, following any appropriate inspection, that final stabilization has, in fact, occurred and that any required permanent structural controls have been completed.

How to Use This Code:
IF YOU WANT TO BUILD OR ESTABLISH A PARTICULAR USE ON YOUR PROPERTY:
STEP 1: You should first determine how your use is categorized. Go to the Use Categories in
§4.6, and find the use category or specific use that most closely describes what you want to
establish.
STEP 2: You should next determine what zoning district, and any applicable overlay
districts, that apply to your property. The official zoning map, which is available at the planning and
engineering department offices, shows the designation for every parcel of land in Alexandria.
STEP 3: Go to §4.5, Use Table, for details on uses permitted on your property. Find the row
that lists the use category or specific use youve identified. Match this row to your district (across
the top of the table) to determine if the use you want to establish is permitted. If the use youve
identified is not listed, go to §4.6.2, Similar use interpretation.
STEP 4: If your use is permitted, before building the structure or establishing the use, you
must get the appropriate permits approved (see Article 9) and comply with the various
development standards of this chapter; although not everything will apply:
?? For details on dimensional requirements (e.g.; minimum lot size, required yards (setbacks),
maximum height, and similar standards), see §4.7.1 for residential district standards and
§4.7.2 for nonresidential district standards;
?? For specific use standards, see Article 5; and
?? For site development standards, see Article 7.
These requirements are intended to help you and the city ensure that your project is legally
established and that it matches the development vision that Alexandria, as a community, desires.
IF YOU OWN OR LEASE PROPERTY AND WANT TO KNOW WHAT RULES APPLY:
Follow Steps 1 through 4, above, to identify your zoning district and the permitted uses. You can
find the specific details for the uses permitted in your zoning district in Article 5. You can also find
the various site development standards that apply to your property in Article 7.
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR ZONING DISTRICT:
Only the city council may rezone property, following public notice and hearings. See 0, Zoning map
amendments (rezoning), for details on the procedure. Also, go to §4.3.1 Residential districts
purpose statements, or §4.3.2, Nonresidential districts purpose statements, to review the intent of
the district applied to your property.

§4.3. Purpose Statements
§4.3.1. Residential districts
A. Estate residential district
The ER, Estate residential district is intended to implement the Estate Residential Land
Use Classification of the THINKAlex Plan. The ER district is used to designate areas that
are best suited for large lot residential uses. Net densities in these areas should be limited
to one unit per three acres maximum.
B. Single family residential districts
The single family residential districts are intended to implement the Single Family
Residential Land Use Classification of the THINKAlex Plan. The single family residential
districts designate areas of low to moderately low density development. Intended for sitebuilt
single family residential construction with a maximum net density of eight units per
acre. Minimum allowable densities in these areas should be restricted to one unit per
acre. Typically, this development is in well-organized subdivisions and is often in
conjunction with schools. There are four types of single family residential districts.
1. AG, Agricultural/residential district
2. SF-1, Single-family (low density) district
3. SF-2, Single-family (moderate density) district
4. SF-3, Single-family (high density) district
C. Multifamily residential districts
The multifamily residential districts are intended to implement the Multifamily Residential
Land Use Classification of the THINKAlex Plan. The single family residential districts
designate areas of moderate to high density residential development. Intended for sitebuilt
multifamily residential construction with a maximum density of 49 units per acre.
Minimum allowable densities in these areas should be restricted to 2 units per acre.
Typical development can include duplex dwellings, townhouses, and multifamily.
1. MF-1, Multifamily (low density) district
2. MF-2, Multifamily (moderate density) district
MF-3, Multifamily (high density) district
D. Mixed use district
The MU, Mixed Use Residential district is intended to implement the Mixed Use
Residential Land Use Classification of the THINKAlex Plan. The MU district designates
areas of high density residential development combined with office and or/retail. This
type of development is often multi-story and uses are often segregated vertically. They
are generally intended for areas of transition between high intensity retail and residential
areas, and to provide opportunities for more creative and diverse neighborhoods.
§4.3.2. Nonresidential districts
A. O, Office District
The O, Office District is intended to accommodate low intensity office and compatible
uses and to serve as a transition between residential uses and more intensive business or
commercial uses.

4-4 | Adopted September 9, 2015 City of Alexandria, Louisiana
B. B-1, Neighborhood Business District
The B-1, Neighborhood Business District is intended to implement the Mixed Use
Residential Land Use Classification of the THINKAlex Plan. The B-1 district commercial
classification designates areas of low intensity development that serves the need for
neighborhood shopping. Intended for small scale retail and office development that
serves the daily or frequent trade or service needs of adjacent residential neighborhoods,
these areas should be restricted to development of integrated clusters of retail and office
facilities with shared access and parking.
C. Regional business/general commercial districts
The regional business/general commercial districts are intended to implement the
Regional Business/General Commercial Land Use Classification of the THINKAlex Plan. The
Regional Business/General Commercial Land Use Classification designates areas of
moderate to high intensity retail and commercial development. Intended for medium to
large scale retail and office development that serves several neighborhoods as well as
areas outside the city. These areas should be restricted to development of integrated
grouping of retail and office facilities with shared access and parking, and limited to
properties with access to arterial class roadways or be required to upgrade existing
roadways to arterial classification if it does not exist. There are four types of regional
business/general commercial districts:
1. B-2, Community business district
The B-2 community business district, as distinguished from the B-1 neighborhood
business district, contains uses of a more varied nature and is intended to serve a
larger population than the immediate surrounding neighborhood. To prevent the
sporadic proliferation of commercial or business uses into surrounding residential
uses, no rezoning petition shall be approved for the B-2 district to be located other
than adjacent to an existing commercial or business district.
2. B-3, General Business District
The B-3, General business district, as distinguished from the B-2, Community
business district, contains uses of a heavier commercial nature, usually involving
larger property requirements, heavier traffic volume, or other annoying factor not
generally associated with a Community Service. To prevent the sporadic
proliferation of commercial or business uses into surrounding residential uses, no
rezoning petition shall be approved for the B-3 district to be located other than
adjacent to an existing commercial or general business district.
3. C-1, Limited Commercial District
The purpose of the C-1 district, as distinguished from the business districts, is to
allow the establishment of a commercial district that includes the sale of
commodities or performance of services for a larger segment of population than the
local community, without the sale of alcoholic beverages. To prevent the sporadic
proliferation of commercial or business uses into surrounding residential uses, no
rezoning petition shall be approved for the C-1 district to be located other than
adjacent to the C-1 or C-2 district.

to the C-1, C-2, I-1 or I-2 district.
D. CBD, Central Business District
The CBD, Central Business District is intended to implement the Downtown Land Use
Classification of the THINKAlex Plan. Downtown Alexandria serves several critical roles for
the community that go beyond its land use. As the heart of the community it offers great
potential for redevelopment and should be treated as a separate land use classification
for coding purposes. Downtown has the potential to support a diverse portfolio of land
uses, including mixed-use, dense residential, and even institutional uses such as an urban
community college. Permitted uses in the CBD district requiring off-street parking shall
include: community home, condominiums, duplex, elderly housing, group housing,
hospital, hotel or motel, institution, philanthropic, juvenile diagnostic center, multifamily,
nursing home, single-family, special home and townhouse as specified in section 7.2.5.
E. Industry districts

The MFO district is intended to encourage an appropriate mixture of residential and
nonresidential uses in areas zoned for office, business or commercial development.
C. MHO, Mobile home overlay district
The MHO district is established for the purpose of allowing placement of a single-family,
owner occupied, mobile home on an individual lot in areas zoned for residential
development as a permanent use.
D. OO, Office overlay district
The OO district is intended to encourage an appropriate mixture of residential and
professional office uses in areas zoned for single-family moderate density (SF-2) district. It
is designed for use in those areas that are experiencing change or transition. The OO,
office overlay district is also intended to accommodate low intensity professional offices
and services and to serve as a transition between residential uses and more intensive

areas or zoning subdistricts; to accommodate and encourage alternative transportation
modes within same; and to provide compatible or thematic streetscape development
standards for geographically defined areas. PUD districts also provide greater flexibility for
subsequent revisions of internal zoning district delineations and/or development
standards, as long as property rights are preserved for property owners affected by same.

§4.6 Use Categories Chapter 28. Article 4. Zoning Districts
§4.6.1 General
Land Development Code
4-12 | Adopted September 9, 2015 City of Alexandria, Louisiana
§4.6. Use Categories
§4.6.1. General
A. Basis for classification
Use categories classify land uses and activities based on similar functional, product, or
physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type
of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, likely impact on
surrounding properties and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis
for assigning land uses to appropriate zoning districts.
B. Principal uses
Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely corresponds to the nature of
the principal use. The characteristics subsection of each use category describes the
common characteristics of each principal use.
C. Developments with multiple principal uses
When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire
development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop,
bookstore and bakery, for example, would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service
category because all of the developments principal uses are in that category. When the
principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is
classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for
that category.
D. Accessory Uses
Accessory uses are allowed by-right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise
stated in the regulations. Also, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the
same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in
the use category descriptions.
E. Use of examples
The examples subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included
in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are
based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a
use that calls itself wholesale warehouse but that sells mostly to consumers, is included
in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Trade category. This is
because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the Retail Sales and
Service category.
F. Uses not included
The uses not included section provides cross-references to uses that may appear to be
part of a particular category, but which are explicitly handled in a different use category.
§4.6.2. Similar use interpretations
A. Authority
If an application is submitted for a use type not listed in the use table (§4.5), the planning
director shall be authorized to make a similar use interpretation, based on the following
considerations:
RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
Chapter 28. Article 4. Zoning Districts §4.6 Use Categories
§4.6.2 Similar use interpretations
City of Alexandria, Louisiana Adopted September 9,
2015 |
Land Development Code
4-13
1. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated
characteristics of each use category;
2. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the
activity;
3. Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
4. The customer type for each activity;
5. The relative number of employees in each activity;
6. Hours of operation;
7. Building and site arrangement;
8. Vehicles used and their parking requirements;
9. The relative number of vehicle trips generated;
10. Required signage;
11. How the use advertises itself;
12. The likely impact on surrounding properties; and
13. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the
site.
B. Use interpretation standards
1. No similar use interpretation shall allow a use in a zoning district when that use is a
permitted or a special exception use in any other zoning district.
2. No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning district unless
evidence shall be presented demonstrating that it will comply with all applicable use
standards and all other applicable requirements and standards of this ordinance.
3. No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in a zoning district unless the use
is more similar to such uses than to permitted and special exception uses allowed in
other zoning districts.
4. If the proposed use is more similar to a use allowed only as a special exception use
in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located, then any similar use
interpretation permitting that use shall require a special exception permit.
C. Effect of similar use interpretation
No similar use interpretation, made upon finding a particular use to be permitted or
permitted by special exception in a specific district, shall authorize the establishment of
such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of
applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and
ordinances of Alexandria. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to,
special exception permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy.

Chapter 28. Article 4. Zoning Districts §4.9 Planned Developments
§4.9.1 Planned development (PD) district
City of Alexandria, Louisiana Adopted September 9,
2015 |
Land Development Code
4-37
§4.9. Planned Developments
§4.9.1. Planned development (PD) district
A. Purpose
Planned development (PD) is an alternative to development in accordance with otherwise
applicable land use district standards. Planned development is established to encourage
flexible and creative site planning based upon a master site development and land
use/zoning plan (development plan) and to accommodate development that may be
difficult if not impossible to carry out under otherwise applicable land use district
standards. Upon approval, a planned development district replaces the otherwise
applicable base district. PD districts have defined geographical boundaries with multiple
land uses and/or unit zoning districts included in same. It requires participation of
property owners within the PD and final plan review by the zoning commission and city
council.
B. Development plan
An approved PD district shall be a distinct zoning district in which an approved
development plan provides standards and restrictions for all subsequent land
development within that district. Any proposed deviations from Code requirements and
standards applicable to conventionally zoned developments shall be clearly stated in the
development plan. Once approved, the city zoning map will be changed to indicate the
designated area as a planned district by type. The plan development, review and approval
process shall be as follows:
1. Developers and/or neighborhood groups desiring to create a PD district shall notify
the planning director of their intent. Notice of intent shall identify geographical
boundaries, desired land uses and development concept. The planning director shall
make a determination as to whether the applicant can feasibly proceed with
formulation of a development plan for the designated area and shall notify the
applicant of decision. The city of Alexandria can create a PD district for a defined
geographical area at its own volition.
2. For an existing developed neighborhood, the planning director shall identify and
notify all property owners within the proposed development district boundaries of a
public meeting to be held in a public facility located within the general vicinity of the
development district. The purpose of this meeting is for the planning director to
advise property owners of the intent to create a PD district, to advise them of
alternatives associated with same, to assist in the election of a steering committee,
to advise how plan development can be funded and to solicit input from affected
property owners. The steering committee shall be responsible for arranging any
subsequent public meetings associated with the plan development. The planning
director and staff will serve in an advisory role as needed.
3. For a new development, the property developer shall assume all responsibility for
funding and drafting the development plan. The preliminary PD district
development plan shall be submitted by the developer for review approval to staff
review board and RAPC.
Commentary: All setbacks are subject to compliance with IRC/ IBC.

4. Once completed, a draft of the development plan shall be submitted to the planning
director for review comments. Final plan presentation, public hearing, zoning
commission review and city council approval, shall be in accordance with §9.5.
Notification of property owners shall be in accordance with requirements stated
therein.
C. Planned development subdivision final plats
Typical subdivision lot final plats shall be submitted in accordance with §9.6.3. Large
subdivision developments intended for development in phases; townhouse or
condominium developments; clustered commercial and/or residential developments; and,
any other phased or incremental planned developments approved by the city council and
located within a PD zoning district, are not required to submit PD district subdivision final
plats to staff review board, RAPC or the city council for approval. Both the planning
director and the mayor are authorized to review and approve all subdivision plats for
properties located within PD zoning districts approved and authorized by city council
ordinance.
D. Required PD districts
The following types of new property developments are specifically required to be
developed as PD districts:
1. Private streets
All property subdivisions in which streets and rights-of-way are to remain private
(i.e., are not to be dedicated to the city for ownership and maintenance) accessing
subdivided lots or structures intended for sale or lease to others.
2. Recreational vehicle parks
All property subdivisions in which utility-equipped recreational vehicle parking
spaces and associated amenities are provided for transient stay through lease or
rental which do not comply with mobile home park district development standards.
§4.9.2. Planned unit developments
A. Purpose
The PUD, Planned Unit Development District is a type of planned development zoning
district established in accordance with §4.9 and labeled as a PUD district. Geographical
boundaries are delineated to accommodate both large- and small-scale developments. A
PUD is intended to accommodate smaller and more closely sited internal defined land use
areas or zoning sub-districts; to accommodate and encourage alternative transportation
modes within same; and to provide compatible or streetscape development standards for
geographically defined areas. PUD districts also provide greater flexibility for subsequent
revisions of internal zoning district delineations and/or development standards, as long as
property rights are preserved for property owners affected by same.
B. Development plan
The following items are required to be addressed by the PUD district development plan:
1. All zoning districts defined elsewhere herein, including diverse use corridor (DUC)
districts, are allowed to be strategically placed or sited within a PUD. Additional
permitted uses may be allowed by the plan for placement within designated
internal zoning districts of a PUD (e.g., ancillary rental units, mixed use structures,

bed and breakfast structures, neighborhood markets, pedestrian-oriented
developments, restoration or redevelopment units, etc.). Transition zones such as
open spaces, greenways, recreation areas, surface water features and
pedestrian/bicycle pathways should be considered between adjoining zoning
districts. Proposed zoning districts and/or transition zones must be delineated
within the plan.
2. Transportation accessibility plans, standards and/or regulations for vehicles,
pedestrians (sidewalks and trails), bicyclists, and mass transit, including parking
and/or corridor requirements, must be included within the plan.
3. Streetscape details, plans, standards and/or regulations must be included within the
plan. Handicapped accessibility is required to be provided in accordance with ADA
regulations.
4. Rear lot access is encouraged. If developer architectural or site development
reviews and/or approvals are required for property development within a PUD, the
plan must define the submittal, review and approval process, including time
constraints, associated with same.
5. Minimum development standards; additional permitted uses; special exceptions;
and PUD property development covenants and/or regulations, must also be
included in the plan for each zoning district and transition zone.
6. Site specific developmental impacts and/or land use compatibility issues including
any required mitigation measures must be addressed in plan. The planning director
may require specific items to be addressed in the plan that it deems significant or
critical for a development plan.
C. District conversions
Districts formerly designated herein as RPD, residential planned developments and CPD,
commercial planned developments shall be hereinafter designated as PUD, planned unit
developments.
§4.9.3. Diverse use corridor
A. Purpose
The DUC, Diverse Use Corridor District is a type of planned development zoning district
established in accordance with §4.9 and labeled as a DUC district. It is a geographically
designated corridor that accommodates mixed land use for property developments
located within same. It is intended to allow flexible siting of various property land uses
allowed within same; to accommodate and encourage alternative transportation modes
along same; and, to provide compatible or streetscape development standards for the
geographically defined corridor.
B. Development plan requirements
The following items are required to be addressed by the DUC district development plan.
1. Allowable property uses within a geographically designated DUC are required to be
defined for each delineated corridor. Additional permitted uses not typically
allowed within conventional zoning districts may be allowed by the plan for
placement within a DUC (e.g., ancillary rental units, mixed use structures, bed and

breakfast structures, neighborhood markets, pedestrian-oriented developments,
restoration or redevelopment units, etc.). Plan must address compatibility issues
and transition requirements for adjoining properties and/or zoning districts.
Allowable land uses may be restricted or expanded for designated sections along a
described corridor; however, these changes in allowable property uses must be
specifically stated in the plan.
2. Transportation accessibility plans, standards and/or regulations for vehicles,
pedestrians, bicyclists, and mass transit, including parking and/or corridor
requirements, must be included within the plan. Consolidated commons, transition
zones and civic spaces are encouraged to be strategically sited within DUC districts.
Clustered common parking areas, which also provide strategically sited civic spaces
within, and as such, may be dedicated to the city for ownership and maintenance,
are encouraged in lieu of constructing individual property parking lots.
3. Streetscape details, plans, standards and/or regulations must be included within the
plan. Handicapped accessibility is required to be provided in accordance with ADA
regulations. Greater use of outdoor space (open-air markets, outdoor cafes, etc.) is
recommended within DUC districts.
4. Streetscape details, plans, standards and/or regulations must be included within the
plan. Building frontages close to the street with easy pedestrian access are
encouraged. If developer architectural or site development reviews and/or
approvals are required for property development within a DUC, the plan must
define the submittal, review and approval process, including time constraints,
associated with same. Thematic developments for designated areas are
encouraged.
5. Minimum development standards; additional permitted uses; special exceptions;
and DUC property development covenants and/or regulations, must also be
included in the plan for each zoning district and transition zone.
Commentary: All buildings are subject to compliance with IRC/ IBC.

Article 5. Use Standards
§5.1. Complexes
Nonresidential, duplex dwellings, townhouse and multifamily building complexes may be established on
a single lot or unified parcel, provided that the following requirements are met.
§5.1.1. Defined
A complex is a group of two or more office, industrial, commercial, two-family houses,
townhouses and multifamily buildings and/or other operations on an unsubdivided parcel,
operating under one name or presenting other elements of a unified image of identity to the
public.
§5.1.2. General
Complexes shall comply with all applicable site development standards as set forth in Article 7,
all other provisions in this chapter, and all other applicable laws.
§5.1.3. Uses
Uses within complexes shall be limited to those permitted within the zoning district in which the
development is located (See also §4.5, Use table).
§5.1.4. Density
The overall density of the land use shall be no higher, and the standard of development no
lower, than that permitted in the district in which the project is located.
§5.1.5. Required yards (setbacks)
The distance of every building from every property line shall comply with the respective yard
front, rear and side requirements of the district in which the development is located as specified
in Article 4. In no case, however, shall any portion of a building be located closer to a street
than the required minimum front yard setback of the zoning district.
§5.1.6. Building separation
Minimum clear distance between any two buildings shall be 20 feet, unless a greater separation
is required by the Fire Code, IRC or IBC.
§5.1.7. Building design
A. Where developments utilize or enjoy a public subsidy, justifying the publics interest in
uniformity, design for buildings within complexes shall exhibit a unity of design through
the use of similar elements such as rooflines, materials, window arrangement, sign
location and details.
B. When public assistance is involved in a project, the city of Alexandria focuses on a
cohesive strategy and philosophy for development, considering corridors of activity in
terms of how developers address community-based growth, i.e., planning, transportation,
economic development, housing, community development, and natural resource
development. To smartly grow, preserve, and develop, the focus is to protect regional
and our municipal senses of community; preserve and capitalize on natural,
infrastructural-intermodal, and cultural resources; fairly and inclusively distribute the
costs and benefits of developments; expand the choices for transportation, employment,

and housing (through mixed-use and other opportunities); value long-range, regional
considerations of sustainability instead of immediate gratification; and promote public
health and healthful communities.
C. If any development involving public funds, incentives, or subsidy  defined as receiving a
present fair market valued subsidy, assistance, credit, or other offset through any program
(Federal, State or local) or cooperative development endeavor or agreement in which the
developer shall receive a value that meets or exceeds in present value one dollar for every
ten dollars in non-public value, then that developer shall adhere to the following minimal
criteria, shall be addressed in any cooperative endeavor and development agreement
demonstrating how the development will:
1. Adhere to existing master planning and facilitate immediate development action as
well as increase the guarantee of long-term success.
2. Leverage financial value with the immediate influx of public infrastructure and
development investments.
3. Relate to alleviating urban flight (and blight), property abandonment, and
economically-distressed neighborhoods  and as a tool for sustainable and
environmentally conscious development.
4. Provide the potential for mixed-use
5. Promote diverse ownership and partnering
6. Preserve, not displace, separate or marginalize our city and its neighborhoods and
people
D. As to valuating a public subsidy relative to project capitalization and partnering, the
following shall be used: Minimize the level of public financial participation in a project
and to attain the most distinctive, highest-quality and marketable project possible.
Partners will be expected to demonstrate a single value for the present value of any and
all subsidies requested to be provided by any public body, including cost of land. Required
funds should be delineated between immediate subsidies (payment for any portion of the
project, waived fees, etc.) and the present value of streams of subsidy over time, such as
tax rebates.

§5.2. Residential Use Standards
§5.2.1. Group homes
A group home shall not include pilot juvenile diagnostic development centers for at risk youths
as established by the department of health and hospitals of the state.
Commentary: Group homes must be reviewed by DHH prior to issuing a building permit.
§5.2.2. Halfway houses
A. The number of offenders at any given halfway house can be no lower than two and no
more than 10. A halfway house aims to assist in community transition, and may provide
vocational training, counseling, and other services. It may also provide 24-hour
supervision or other terms of supervision as designated by the Louisiana Department of
Corrections or other qualified authority.
B. A halfway house may be used for people in addiction recovery as a means to adapt to
sober living. It may be used for convicted persons as a process of facilitating their
readjustment to private life. Residents may be required to follow certain rules, such as
sign in and sign out procedures and curfews. A halfway house may allow residents to go
out to work or study during daytime and return at night. Residency requirements,
purposes, and rules vary at each halfway house.
C. A halfway house shall not be occupied as a residence by persons who constitute a family.
This excludes family members who are residents who are current formerly
institutionalized individuals receiving assistance to reenter society. The domicile of the
residents and the typical length of stay can be examined to determine the use of the
property being characterized as a halfway house.
D. There should be population turnover in a halfway house, which is incompatible with the
city's interpretation of "family."
E. Before acceptance of a structure as a halfway house by the city, there must be a
certification of such either by the Louisiana Department of Corrections, the Louisiana
Board of Pardons, the Louisiana Board of Parole, the Internal Revenue Service, the
Louisiana Secretary of State or any other qualified local, state or federal agency.
Commentary: Half way houses must be reviewed by DOC and DHH prior to issuing a building permit.
§5.2.3. Single-family dwellings
In nonresidential districts where single-family dwellings are allowed, single-family dwellings
must be occupied by the owner.
§5.2.4. Upper-story residential
Notwithstanding other provisions to the contrary, all upper-story residential shall adhere to all
dimensional standards of the permitted nonresidential use.

§5.3. Public and Civic Use Standards
§5.3.1. Hospitals
Where hospitals are allowed in residential districts and in the C-1 district, hospitals shall not be:
A. Primarily for patients suffering from contagious diseases; and
B. Located less than 100 feet from the property line adjacent to any residential district or
any existing residential use.
§5.3.2. Telecommunications towers and facilities
A. Purposes/goals
The provisions of this section are intended to serve the following purposes and goals:
1. Minimize the total number of towers throughout the city of Alexandria and its
related planning region by:
(a) Encouraging strongly the location of antennas of at least three wireless
communications providers per existing or new tower, and by;
(b) Encouraging strongly wireless communication providers to initially maximize
and to continue to update equipment, to the extent made possible by the
then current technical state of art, to ensure the highest possible cell capacity
in terms of number of calls handled (or other succeeding capacity
measurement);
2. Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse visual and/or safety
impacts of towers, antennas and housing facilities;
3. Encourage users of antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, on existing
structures, such as lighting towers, water tanks or buildings, and encourage users of
towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in non-residential areas
where the adverse impact on the community is reduced
4. When it is determined by substantial data that no alternate location of a tower is
possible other than in a residential area, encourage strongly users to employ
alternate tower (sometimes referred to as "stealth") designs or locations, such as
modified clock towers, church spires, flag poles, artificial trees or building
modifications;
5. When new tower siting is the only available alternative, to require siting of the most
visually intrusive and taller towers in the less developed, lower population areas
and to require adequate landscaping, both of tower base and housing facilities,
which will necessarily be more rigorous in residential areas where potential visual
impact is greatest. Where higher visual impact towers are unavoidable, such as
guyed lattice towers, to locate them in outlying areas of the community.
6. Encourage users to employ tower types and antenna configurations having the least
visual impact on the community, such as monopole designs, and, if using horizontal
cross-bar or star-antenna mounts is unavoidable, to blend or shield them into the
tower, using "stealth shrouds."

B. Site plan review
A site plan must be approved pursuant to the provisions of §9.11 prior to the issuance of a
building permit.
C. Siting policy
No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable
satisfaction of the planning director that no existing tower or structure can accommodate
the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any
of the following:
1. No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
2. Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's
engineering requirements.
3. Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength/space to
support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
4. The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with
the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing
towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed
antenna.
5. The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an
existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are
unreasonable. Costs exceeding the cost of new tower development are presumed
to be unreasonable.
6. The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing
towers and structures unsuitable.
D. Colocation
1. Approval for a proposed tower within a radius of 10,000 feet from an existing tower
or other suitable structure shall not be granted unless the applicant certifies that
the existing towers or structures does not meet applicant's structural specifications
or technical design requirements, or that a co-location agreement could not be
obtained at a reasonable market rate and in a timely manner.
2. In order to accomplish the purposes/goals of §5.3.2.A, above, and siting policy of
§5.3.2.C, above, and to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare
the city of Alexandria will use the following order of preference in siting wireless
communications antennas and towers within any district:
(a) Co-location of antennas on, or replacement of, existing towers and, in the
process, adding additional co-locaters to the tower;
(b) On existing structures such as buildings, communications towers, water
towers, smokestacks, and athletic, street or traffic light standards;

(c) Using stealth designs involving mounting antennas within existing buildings or
structures in the form of bell towers, clock towers, or other architectural
modification of buildings, or by mounting antennas on artificial trees; and
(d) In locations where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings, or other
structures provide the greatest amount of screening.
E. Tower sites
1. Colocation
No new cell may be established if there is a technically suitable place available on an
existing communications tower within the search area that the new cell site is to
serve. For the purpose of this article, the search area is defined as the grid for the
placement of the antenna.
2. Tower density
No more than one site for telecommunications towers within any given radius of
500 feet shall be permitted. Telecommunications towers of a monopole design shall
be excluded from this density requirement.
3. Minimum lot area
Notwithstanding other provisions to the contrary, the minimum lot area on which a
telecommunications tower is to be located shall be the minimum lot area for the
underlying district or 4,500 square feet, whichever is greater, and shall be of
sufficient size to contain on-site any debris from tower failure.
4. Location relative to dwellings
(a) The distance between the base of the commercial telecommunications
towers, masts, aerials and/or antennas and any residential development shall
not be less than the height of the structure from the top of the antenna to
grade. Rooftop masts, aerials and/or antennas shall be excluded from the
distance requirement to lot lines.
(b) The distance between the building upon which a rooftop telecommunications
tower is located and any residential development shall not be less than the
total height of the building plus the height of the rooftop tower.
F. Height
Telecommunications towers 50 feet in height or less, or five feet or less above the tree
line shall be permitted. In no case shall the height of any tower be greater than 65 feet.
G. Setbacks
All telecommunications towers shall maintain a setback from all property line equal to 100
percent of the tower height plus ten percent.
H. Design
1. Monopole towers
(a) Monopole towers shall be utilized unless otherwise approved by the board of
adjustment and appeals.
(b) The tower itself must be of such design and treated with an architectural
material so that it is camouflaged; e.g., the tower may be made resemble a

incorporated into an existing church steeple.
2. Materials
(a) Facilities
The entire facility must be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with its
environment. The use of wood, brick, or stucco is required for associated
support buildings, which shall be designed to architecturally match the
exterior of structures within the neighborhood. In no case will metal exteriors
be allowed for accessory buildings.
(b) Walls or fences
Walls or fences constructed of wood, brick or masonry or other suitable
material, shall be used to secure the site and provide an opaque barrier. Such
walls or fences shall be used in conjunction with landscaping to provide
security or increase the buffer with adjacent residential uses. In no case will
barbed wire or razor wire fencing be adjacent to residential districts.
Commentary: Fences over seven feet high need to be permitted and materials approved prior to erection.
I. Visual impact mitigation
1. Color
The telecommunications tower shall be constructed of a material with a neutral
color and shall be designed to blend in with the surrounding landscape and uses.
2. Lighting
When lighting is required and is permitted by the Federal Aviation Administration or
other federal or state authority, it shall be orientated inward so as not to project
onto surrounding residential property.
3. Design
The design criteria for telecommunications towers and their associated buildings
shall follow the provisions of §5.3.2.H.
4. Landscaping
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practical. All
towers shall be landscaped with at least one row of evergreen shrubs or trees within
20 feet of the tower's base. Such trees shall be a minimum of four feet high when
planted and spaced not more than 15 feet apart. These trees and shrubs shall be
planted in any configuration which will serve to better buffer the site.
5. Lighting
Dual lighting shall be employed on telecommunications towers when lighting is
required and as permitted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other
federal or state authority. For the purposes of this article and to minimize intrusion
into other areas, dual lighting shall be considered as strobe lighting during the
daylight hours and red lighting at night.

incomplete, or incorrect, the city may obtain, at its cost and expense, an estimate
which shall be used for purposes of determining the amount of the performance
guarantee. The telecommunications provider shall take all action necessary to keep
such performance guarantee valid and in effect at all times. Expiration of a
performance guarantee may, at the option of the city and following notice to the

objection to the placement of a mobile home temporary housing unit
on said property.
(3) Installation of a mobile home temporary housing unit shall meet
applicable minimum setback standards for the zoning district in which it
is located, but shall not be placed closer to the street right-of-way than
adjoining structures along that side of the public street.
(4) If a mobile home temporary housing unit is not located within an
approved single-family residential zoning district with a mobile home
overlay or within a mobile home park, placement of a full size mobile
home temporary housing unit will require issuance of a temporary
placement permit. Temporary placement permit shall be issued by the
office of the building official and shall remain valid for a period not to
exceed two years. The temporary placement permit fee shall be $50.
On-site verification by the city building official, confirming the
temporary housing unit has been placed in accordance with all
applicable local, state and/or federal standards, is required before the
temporary placement permit shall become effective.
(5) Placement of a mobile home temporary housing unit requires that offstreet
parking be available on the lot on which the temporary housing
unit is placed.
2. City utility service connections
City utility service connections shall be made in accordance with all applicable city
standards after payment of meter connection service fees and/or deposits. Each
utility department will be allowed to make minor exceptions in utility service
connection requirements as needed to accommodate temporary and/or emergency
nature of utility service connections where applicable, as long as public safety is
assured.

Industrial 40 8 40 8 60 8
D. Medians (boulevards)
For divided streets (boulevards) a minimum median width of ten feet for local streets and
14 feet for collector and arterial streets shall be required.
§6.4.8. Street connectivity
A. Purpose
An interconnected street system is necessary in order to promote orderly and safe
development by ensuring that streets function in an interdependent manner, provide
adequate access for emergency and service vehicles, enhance access by ensuring
connected transportation routes, and provide continuous and comprehensible traffic
routes.
B. Connectivity Defined
Connectivity shall be defined by the ratio of links to nodes in any subdivision.
1. The connectivity ratio shall be the number of street links divided by the number of
nodes or end links, including cul-de-sac heads.
2. A link shall be any portion of a street, other than an alley, defined by a node at
either end. Stub-outs to adjacent property shall be considered links. For the purpose
of determining the number of links in a development, boulevards, median-divided
roadways, and divided entrances shall be treated the same as conventional two-way
roadways.
3. A node shall be the terminus of a street or the intersection of two or more streets.
(a) Any curve or bend of a street that exceeds 75 degrees shall receive credit as a
node. Any curve or bend of a street that does not exceed 75 degrees shall not
be considered a node.
(b) A divided entrance shall only count once.

EXAMPLE 1: Does not meet ratio
(13 links/11 nodes = 1.18)
EXAMPLE 2: Modified to meet ratio
(16 links/11 nodes = 1.45)
KEY: Number = Link ?? = Node
C. Required ratio
1. The street network for any subdivision with internal roads or access to any public
road shall achieve a connectivity ratio of not less than 1.40 in all districts except in
the ER district, measured within the subdivision.
2. Within the ER district, the street network for any subdivision with internal roads or
access to any public road shall achieve a connectivity ratio of not less than 1.15,
measured within the subdivision.
3. Street links and nodes along a collector or arterial street providing access to a
proposed subdivision shall not be considered in computing the connectivity ratio.
Commentary: A through C, above, provide a formula that ensures a consistent number of links. But, to ensure
sufficient external connections, D, below, is needed as well. One could design a subdivision with one external
connection and lots of internal connectivity to meet the ration standard.. Hence, the "double standard".
D. External access required
1. External access to development shall be provided as indicated below. In
determining the number of access points that shall be required, the cumulative
impacts of prior developments on the roads shall be considered.
(a) For developments with 30 or fewer lots, at least one point of access to the
roadway network shall be provided.
(b) For developments with between 31 and 60 lots, at least two points of access
to the roadway network shall be provided.
(c) For developments with more than 60 lots, at least three points of access to
the roadway shall be provided.

(d) For developments with more than 90 lot, additional point of access may be
required.
2. A divided entrance shall count as one point of access.
E. Alternative compliance
The planning director may approve variations in the requirements of this section when
additional access points are precluded in the following circumstances:
1. If the only additional access points available would require crossing floodplains,
wetlands, steep slopes, or other similar natural features; or
2. When the existing development pattern precludes additional access points and
fewer units than would otherwise be allowed would be out of character with the
surrounding development.
§6.5. Sidewalks and pathways
§6.5.1. Sidewalks required
A. Sidewalks are hereby required to be provided along both sides of arterial and collector
streets within a new subdivision, or on the side of any arterial and collector streets
adjacent to the subdivision.
B. Sidewalks are required to be provided only along one side of streets within or adjacent to
a new subdivision located within residential, commercial, multifamily, or office zoned
districts.
1. Sidewalks shall be provided on the side of the street designated by the planning
director.
2. For subdivision developments adjacent to existing streets, sidewalks shall not be
required if already existing on the opposite side of the street. Where sidewalks do
not already exist on the opposite side of the street, whether sidewalks shall be
required shall be determined by the planning director based on the configuration of
the existing or planned sidewalk network in the vicinity.
3. Sidewalks shall not be required for streets located within industrial zoned districts.
The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development shall determine
whether sidewalks are required for subdivision developments along state highways.
4. Construction of the sidewalks shall be the responsibility of the developer.
§6.5.2. Minimum standards
The construction or reconstruction of all sidewalks on public property shall be in accordance
with the minimum standards of the city.

§6.5.4. Sidewalks layout
A. In residential districts, all sidewalks shall be constructed so as to leave a minimum of three
feet of grassy area between the sidewalk and the curb.
B. In nonresidential districts, the entire sidewalk area may be paved, provided the walk is
scored in such a manner that the entire sidewalk will not have to be removed for
adjustment, repairs or maintenance of utility lines thereunder.
§6.5.5. Pathways
A shared-use pathway serves as part of a transportation circulation system and supports
multiple recreation opportunities, such as walking, bicycling, and inline skating. A shared-use
pathway typically has a surface that is asphalt, concrete, or firmly packed crushed aggregate.
The 1999 AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities defines a shared-use path as
being physically separated from motor vehicular traffic with an open space or barrier (AASHTO,
1999). Shared-use pathways should always be designed to include pedestrians even if the
primary anticipated users are bicyclists.
§6.6. Servitudes
§6.6.1. Servitude required
A. A servitude shall be provided at a minimum of 10 feet wide along the rear or side lot line
of each lot when necessary for either drainage or utility improvement, or both.
B. Where it is necessary to install storm sewers or paved drainage ditches along the side lot
lines or across lots, a minimum servitude of 10 feet for the construction and maintenance
of these improvements shall be dedicated.
§6.6.2. Plantings
No trees, shrubs or others plants may be planted nor shall any building, fence, driveway,
structure or improvement be constructed or installed within or over any servitude or right-ofway
as to prevent or unreasonably interfere with any purpose for which the servitude or rightof-
way is granted.
§6.6.3. Swale ditches and yard drain structures
Private servitudes shall be platted and granted by the developer to the subdivision development
in perpetuity for swale ditches and yard drain structures constructed to accommodate rear and
side lot drainage where required.
§6.7. Drainage
§6.7.1. General
A. The subdivider or developer shall plan all drainage for the project in accordance with the
"master drainage plan."

B. Drainage improvement shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the "Design
Criteria of Storm Sewers and Appurtenance, City of Alexandria, Louisiana, Department of
Public Works."
C. All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the requirement of §7.6, Flood damage
prevention.
§6.7.2. Drainage design
A. Site drainage shall be routed to public waterways, permanent surface (streets) or
subsurface drainage facilities adequate to dispose of present and future anticipated runoff
from the site and from contributing off-site watershed areas. Public or private servitudes
shall be provided for stormwater routing until it reaches a public drainage facility.
B. The minimum grades at buildings shall be at elevations, which prevent adverse effect by
water entering from flood levels equivalent to a 100-year return frequency. The floor
elevations of all habitable space shall be at or above flood levels equivalent to a 100-year
return frequency.
C. All points in each lot shall be graded to the nearest publicly maintained drainage facility or
waterway and in compliance with applicable IBC requirements.
§6.7.3. Water features
A. In developments constructed with water features (ponds, pools, lakes, canals) having
either outfall elevation controls or discharge restrictions which potentially change either
normal water or base flood elevations (BFE), the developer's engineering consultant will
be required to either:
1. Provide minimum building foundation elevations for each lot identified on the
subdivision plat for the proposed development that will preclude structural flooding
for a 100-year storm event, in which case the city floodplain manager is to be
provided the BFE information by letter with a copy of the plat for future reference;
or
2. Certify on the subdivision plat that the proposed water features have been assessed
by the consultant and determined to have no impact on FIRM published base flood
elevations, and furthermore, that site grades provided for lots within the proposed
development are either at or above an elevation that precludes structural flooding
for a 100-year storm event.
B. The developer is required to designate property ownership for land inundated by the
water feature in one of two ways:
1. If land under the water feature is to be commonly owned by a homeowner's
association, then the subdivision plat is required to reflect same. All legal
requirements for establishing the association and developing subdivision covenant
restrictions are to be met in accordance with applicable legal statutes.
2. An elevated buffer strip around the water feature (minimum width of 20 feet
around the normal pool stage) is to be included as commonly owned property and
rear lot lines of adjoining lots are to be platted and staked accordingly. If the water
feature is completely surrounded by lots, at least one 20-foot access strip is to be

included as common ownership allowing access to/from the nearest public right-ofway
to the water feature. Subdivision restrictions are to be adopted that restrict
placement of any structures, fences, retaining walls, fill material, etc., within the
area of common ownership. The area of common ownership under and around the
water feature shall be designated as an area with flooding/flowage servitudes for
stormwater runoff routed through the pond. The buffer area can be developed with
landscaping, site furniture (benches, fishing piers, etc.) and pathways for
homeowner's recreational use.
3. If property under the water feature is to be privately owned, lot lines are to be
drawn to include all property under the water feature. The subdivision covenant
restrictions shall include the provision that property within the platted limits of the
water feature's normal pool stage, including a 20-foot buffer strip around same, is
not to be developed by property owners in such a way that would impact its use for
flooding/flowage of stormwater runoff. That includes placing fill in the water
feature or any other action that would restrict or limit its intended use.
Intermediate property corners are to be platted and staked at each of the
intersections of the 20-foot buffer strip with rear lot lines. If lands around the water
feature are to be elevated with retaining walls, hydraulic calculations for the
development are to reflect this land as being unavailable for stormwater storage.
The maximum elevation to which fill can be placed within the buffer strip shall be

§7.2. Parking
§7.2.1. Purposes
The regulations of this section are in rough proportion to the generalized parking and
transportation demands of different land uses. By requiring such facilities, it is the intent of this
section to help avoid the negative impacts associated with spillover parking into adjacent
neighborhoods, while at the same time avoiding the negative environmental and urban design
impacts that can result from parking lots and other vehicular use areas. The provisions of this
section are also intended to help protect the public health, safety, and general welfare by:
A. Helping avoid and mitigate traffic congestion;
B. Encouraging multi-modal transportation options and enhanced pedestrian safety;
C. Providing methods to reduce the amount of impervious surfaces in parking areas and
adequate drainage structures in order to reduce the environmental impacts of storm
water runoff;
D. Encouraging paving or alternate means of surfacing of parking areas in order to address
dust abatement and improve air quality; and
E. Providing flexible methods for responding to the parking and access demands of various
land uses in different areas of the city.

facilities, including the obligation to maintain the common area and facilities and the
power to compel contributions from lot owners to cover their proportionate share of the
costs associated with the maintenance of the common areas and facilities.
B. Such association or similar legal entity must be established before any dwelling unit or lot
in the development is sold or any building in the development occupied.
§7.5.2. Documentation
A. Membership in the association shall be mandatory and automatic for all homeowners of
the development and their successors.
B. If the association will be responsible for maintaining any common area and facilities, the
covenants shall include the following language or language of similar effect approved by
the city attorney:
1. If at any time the association fails to maintain any common area and facilities, the
city shall have the right but not the obligation to complete required maintenance, to
charge the costs of such maintenance to the homeowners association, and, if not
paid, collect such cost from the members as assessments by the association. This
assessment shall not be subject to general limitations imposed on assessments by
the association, such as those limiting the total amount of an assessment, limiting
annual increases in assessments and/or requiring membership votes on specific
assessments.
2. Documents providing for the establishment of a homeowners association or similar
legal entity in accordance with this section must be submitted to, and approved by,
the planning director and the city attorney before any plat for the development is
recorded.
3. The planning directors review is limited to ensuring that the homeowners
association or similar legal entity is established so that it has clear legal authority to
maintain and exercise control over the common areas and facilities, including the
power to compel contributions from development residents to cover their
proportionate shares of the costs associated with the maintenance of the common
areas and facilities.
C. The purpose of the city attorneys review is to ensure that the city has all necessary
authority to remedy a default in the maintenance obligations of the association and to
recover the costs of such remedy from the association or its members.
Commentary: A homeowners association or similar entity is needed to maintain common area and facilities, where
such area and facilities are provided and not dedicated to the city.
§7.6. Flood Damage Prevention
§7.6.1. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods
A. Statutory authorization
The Legislature of the State of Louisiana has in statute LRS 38:84 delegated the
responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood
losses. Therefore, the city council of the city of Alexandria, Louisiana, does ordain as
follows:
RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
§7.6 Flood Damage Prevention Chapter 28. Article 7. Site Development Standards
§7.6.2 Flood damage prevention-related definitions
Land Development Code
7-38 | Adopted September 9, 2015 City of Alexandria, Louisiana
B. Findings of fact
1. The flood hazard areas of city of Alexandria are subject to periodic inundation,
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.
2. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to
other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
C. Statement of purpose
It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare
and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by
provisions designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of
flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
7. Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
D. Methods of reducing flood losses
In order to accomplish its purposes, this section uses the following methods:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of
flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood
damage; and
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

A. Lands to which this section applies
The ordinance from which this section derives shall apply to all areas of special flood
hazard within the jurisdiction of the city of Alexandria.
B. Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in the current scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) for city of Alexandria, Louisiana, Rapides Parish," dated September 3, 1997,
and surrounding Rapides Parish (unincorporated areas) FIRMs dated September 3, 1997,
that include part of the city of Alexandria Corporate Limits, with accompanying Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 3, 1997, and any revisions thereto are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section.
C. Establishment of development permit
A floodplain development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the
provisions of this section.
D. Compliance
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without
full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations.
E. Abrogation and greater restrictions
This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing servitudes,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section and another ordinance,
servitude, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
F. Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions shall be:
1. Considered as minimum requirements;
2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
G. Warning and disclaimer or liability
The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare
occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside the areas of special
flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official
or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for
the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are
in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A
record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the
floodplain administrator.
3. Enclosures
New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below
the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by
allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or

limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring
requirements for resisting wind forces.
(b) Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved
within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside
of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home
park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial
damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such
that the bottom of the longitudinal structural I beam of the manufactured
home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement.

Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on
the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit
requirements of §9.9.1, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
"manufactured homes" in §7.6.5.B.4. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use
if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions.
C. Standards for subdivision proposals
1. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall be consistent with §7.6.1.B, §7.6.1.C, and §7.6.1.D.
2. All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of
manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development
permit requirements of §7.6.3.C; §9.9.1 and the provisions of §7.6.5.
3. Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other
proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and
subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not
otherwise provided pursuant to §7.6.3.B or §8.6.2.A.5.

flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation
or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures:
(a) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base
flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no
depth number is specified); or
(b) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that
below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood
elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
3. A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the
floodplain administrator that the standards of §7.6.5, as proposed in the permit
procedures of §9.9.1, are satisfied.
4. Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on
slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
E. Floodways
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in §7.6.3.B, are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the
following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
2. If subsection 1 above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of
§7.6.5.
3. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood
Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the
adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood
elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions
required by Section 65.12.

F. Penalties for noncompliance
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or
altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable
regulations. Violation of the provisions of this section by failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Each day the violation continues shall be
deemed a new violation. In addition, the violator shall pay all costs and expenses involved
in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent city of Alexandria from taking such
other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
§7.7. Storm Drainage
§7.7.1. Applicability
Developments that are subject to site plan review (§9.11) must be served by an appropriate
storm drainage control system in accordance with the requirements of this section.
§7.7.2. General Requirement
The storm drainage plan, to the extent practical, will attempt to follow the principle that the
water falling on a given site should be absorbed to the extent that after development the
quantity and rate of water leaving the site would not be significantly different than if the site
had remained undeveloped. In part, the intent of the plan should be to minimize the adverse
cumulative effects of development in an area on drainage. Techniques that capitalize on and
are consistent with natural resources and processes will be
used whenever possible, including but not limited to:
A. Rain catchment and harvesting for on-site irrigation
purposes; and
B. Rain gardens (shallow depressions or swells) that slow
storm runoff and reduce the impact of what is found in
storm water as it enters storm drainage control
systems.
Commentary: A rain garden allows runoff to re-enter the soil, and is a place where water-tolerant plants are used to
provide a pretty place.
§7.7.3. Storm Drainage Plans
A storm drainage plan shall be provided as follows:
A. The plan shall include provisions to control water and wind erosion during and after
construction associated with the development.
B. Runoff from impervious surfaces with 3 or more acres of impervious area should be
directed to retention areas or through vegetated areas as needed to allow sedimentation
and filtration of contaminants to occur before runoff enters canals, rivers or wetland
areas.
C. All drainage facilities must:
1. Conform to the "Design Criteria of Storm Sewers and Appurtenance, City of
Alexandria, Louisiana, Department of Public Works."
2. Be designed to serve the entire drainage area in which the facilities are located; and

A. Signs
Signs (on-premises and off-premises) are permitted subject to §7.4, Signs, and the
following requirements.
1. No sign shall be indirectly illuminated or have any flashing or moving lights or any
lights that interfere or cause disturbances with flight operations.
2. No sign shall exceed 35 feet in height.
§7.8.6. Height and obstruction criteria
A. Prohibited land uses
The following uses are expressly prohibited in conjunction with those prohibited uses in
§7.8.3, Land use.
1. Uses that release into the air any substance that would impair visibility or interfere
with the operation of aircraft; e.g., steam, dust or smoke.
2. Uses that produce light emissions, either direct or indirect (reflective), that would
interfere with pilot vision.
3. Uses that produce emissions that would interfere with aircraft communications
systems or navigational equipment.
4. Uses that would attract birds or waterfowl, such as operation of sanitary landfills,
maintenance of feeding stations or growth of certain vegetation.
B. Height limitations
Height limitations shall be as defined and identified through the following definitions and
illustrative drawing on file with the city clerk and planning division. No structure or
physical obstruction shall be constructed or positioned to extend above the following
spatial geometric surfaces as defined herein.
1. Primary surface
A surface on the ground or water, centered lengthwise on the runway and
extending 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. The width of the primary
surface is 2,000 feet at Alexandria International Airport.
2. Clear zone surface
A surface on the ground or water, beginning at the runway end and symmetrical
about the runway centerline extended.
3. Approach-departure clearance surface
An inclined plane or combination inclined and horizontal plane, symmetrical about
the runway centerline extended. The inclined plane flares outward and upward
from the primary surface, and begins with the centerline elevation of the runway
end. The slope ratio and dimensions of the inclined plane and dimensions of the

horizontal plane vary with the type of runway prescribed. For Alexandria
International Airport runways, the slope ratio of the inclined plane is fifty to one
(50:1) until it reaches an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield
elevation. It then continues horizontally at this elevation to a point 50,000 feet from
the point of beginning. The outer width is 16,000 feet.
4. Inner horizontal surface
An oval-shaped plane at a height of 150 feet above the established airfield
elevation. It is constructed by scrubbing an arc with a radius of 7,500 feet about the
centerline at each end of each runway and interconnecting these areas with
tangents.
(a) Conical surface
An inclined plane that extends from the periphery of the inner horizontal
surface outward and upward at a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a
horizontal distance of 7,000 feet to a height of 500 feet above the established
airfield elevation.
(b) Outer horizontal surface
A plane located 500 feet above the established airfield elevation, extending
outward from the outer periphery of the conical surface for a horizontal
distance of 30,000 feet.
(c) Transitional surface
Inclined planes that connect the primary surface and the approach departure
clearance surfaces to the inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer
horizontal, or other transitional surfaces. The slope is seven to one (7:1)
outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and runway
centerline extended. To determine the elevation for the beginning of the
transitional surface slope at any point along the lateral boundary of the
primary surface, draw a line from the point, perpendicular to the runway
centerline or to the runway centerline extended. The elevation of the runway
or of the runway centerline extended at that intersection is the elevation for
the beginning of the seven to one (7:1) slope.

§9.9.1 Purpose
Land Development Code
9-32 | Adopted September 9, 2015 City of Alexandria, Louisiana
§9.9. Administrative Adjustments
§9.9.1. Purpose
Administrative adjustments are specified deviations from otherwise applicable development
standards where development is proposed that would be:
A. Compatible with surrounding land uses;
B. Harmonious with the public interest; and
C. Consistent with the purposes of this Code.
§9.9.2. Applicability
The planning director shall have the authority to authorize adjustment of up to 20 percent from
any numerical standard set forth in §4.7, Dimensional Requirements or Article 7, Site
Development Standards. Any adjustment request greater than 20 percent shall be treated as a
variance handled by the board of adjustment and appeals, subject to the requirements of §9.8,
Variances.
Commentary: For example, where a large oak tree is located in the side lot of a SF-1 district lot, which has a 7.5 foot
side (interior) setback, and strict compliance would mean the loss of the tree, the planning director may reduce the
setback to 6 feet.
§9.9.3. Applications
An application for an administrative adjustment shall be submitted in accordance with §8.2.2,
Application requirements.
§9.9.4. Action by planning director
The planning director shall review the application and approve, approve with conditions or deny
the application based upon the criteria below. A written decision
including affirmative findings on the criteria set forth below shall be
mailed to the applicant.
§9.9.5. Administrative adjustment criteria
A. To approve an application for an administrative adjustment, the
planning director shall make an affirmative finding that the
following criteria are met:
1. That granting the adjustment will ensure the same general
level of land use compatibility as the otherwise applicable
standards;
2. That granting the adjustment will not materially and
adversely affect adjacent land uses and the physical
character of uses in the immediate vicinity of the
proposed development because of inadequate buffering,
screening, setbacks and other land use considerations;
3. That granting the adjustment will be generally consistent with the purposes and
intent of this Code; and
4. The strict application of the provisions of the Code would result in unnecessary
hardship.

Article 10. Nonconformities
§10.1. Purpose and Intent
A. Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted
there exist (1) lots, (2) structures, (3) uses of land and structures, and (4) characteristics of
use, which were lawful when they were established, but which would be prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the
intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed,
but not to encourage their survivalexcept by application of a special exception to the
board of adjustment and appeals.
B. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
C. Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses
in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure; a nonconforming use of land,
or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or
enlarged by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen
from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be
prohibited generally in the district involved.
§10.2. GENERAL
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction or designated use of any building on which actual building construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the regulations of this chapter and upon which
actual building has been carried on diligently. For the purpose of this section, "actual construction" shall
mean the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun in

nonconforming status when each of the following conditions is satisfied:
A. The use or structure does not conform to the current regulations prescribed in the district
in which such use or structure is located, but was lawfully in existence and lawfully
constructed, located and operating prior to, and at the time of the event that made such
use or structure nonconforming.
B. The event that made such use or structure nonconforming was one of the following:
1. A boundary adjustment of the city, adoption of this chapter or a previous zoning
ordinance, or amendment of this chapter.

§10.4 Nonconforming Lots Chapter 28. Article 10. Nonconformities
§10.3.2 Abandonment
Land Development Code
10-2 | Adopted September 9, 2015 City of Alexandria, Louisiana
2. The nonconforming use or the use occupying the nonconforming structure has been
operating since the time that the use or structure first became nonconforming
without abandonment, as abandonment is defined in §10.3.2, below.
§10.3.2. Abandonment
Whenever a nonconforming use or a conforming use in a nonconforming structure is
abandoned, all nonconforming rights shall cease and the use of the premises shall henceforth
conform to this chapter. Abandonment shall involve the actual act of discontinuance, regardless
of the intent of the user or owner to discontinue a nonconforming operation. Any
nonconforming use that is discontinued for, or that remains vacant for a period of six
consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period (except when government
action impedes access to the premises), shall be considered to have been abandoned. Any
nonconforming use that is moved from the premises shall be considered to have been
abandoned.
§10.3.3. Burden of proof
The burden of establishing nonconforming status under these regulations shall, in all cases, be
that of the owner or the party claiming a lawful nonconforming use and/or structure, and not
the citys.
§10.3.4. Reinstatement of nonconforming use status by special exception
A. Where the nonconforming use status has expired by operation of law, and where the
owner can prove that such nonconforming use once legally existed; the owner may apply
to the board of adjustment and appeals for a special exception reinstating the former
nonconforming use status. However the requested nonconforming use status shall be
similar to the previous nonconforming use and shall not involve the increasing in size of
the structure or significant changes to the land upon which the structure sits.
B. The board of adjustment and appeals has the authority to grant this special exception. The
written application for the special exception shall be submitted in accordance with the
provisions of §9.7. In addition, the applicant must show the following:
1. Proof that the nonconforming use predates the current zoning designation for the
land or structure;
2. A description of the use that is allegedly legally nonconforming;
3. Proof that it was legally nonconforming before the current application was
submitted. Such proof may include zoning compliances, occupational licenses,
planning permits, building permits, utility records, leases, or other such records or
documentation.
§10.4. Nonconforming Lots
§10.4.1. Permitted use
A. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and
customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance that made the lot nonconforming,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such lot must be
in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same

ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard
dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the
lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of
yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of adjustment and
appeals.
B. If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage
in single ownership are of record at the time the lot became nonconforming, and if all or
part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an individual parcel for the purposes of this chapter,
and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner that diminishes compliance
with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made that creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in
this chapter.
§10.4.2. Actions of governmental agencies
Where, after the effective date of this chapter, a governmental agency obtains a portion of a
conforming lot for public purposes and thereby on the remainder creates a nonconforming lot,
permitted principal and accessory structures in the district in which said lot is located may be
erected or constructed on the lot provided that all other requirements of this chapter are met.
§10.4.3. Nonconforming mobile home lots
Nonconforming mobile home lots may continue, including the replacement of the mobile home
on such lots, unless and until the lot remains vacant for a period of 180 days. Upon the
expiration of 180 days, the nonconforming lot may not be continued, or used as a mobile home
site.
§10.5. Nonconforming Structures
§10.5.1. Continuation
The lawful, conforming use of a structure, existing at the effective date of these regulations,
may be continued, although the structures size or location does not conform with the area, lot
open space, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other provisions of this chapter.
§10.5.2. Enlarged or altered
No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its
nonconformity; but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its
nonconformity.
§10.5.3. Destroyed or damaged
Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by
any means to an extent of more than 50 per cent of its replacement cost at time of destruction,
it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
§10.5.4. Moved
Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.

Land Development Code
10-4 | Adopted September 9, 2015 City of Alexandria, Louisiana
§10.5.5. Repairs and maintenance

maintenance does not in any way increase its nonconformity and it remains otherwise lawful.
§10.6. Nonconforming Uses
§10.6.1. Continuation
The lawful nonconforming use of a structure or land at the effective date of this chapter may be
continued so long as the then existing or a more restricted use continues, except that:
A. Only that portion of the land in actual use may be so continued, and the nonconforming
use may not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor may any additional structures be
added to be occupied by the nonconforming use.
B. Normal maintenance, repair, and incidental alteration of a building occupied by a
nonconforming use are permitted, provided it does not extend the nonconforming use. A
structure occupied by a nonconforming use may be changed to make the structure more
in character with the uses permitted in the district in which it is located. , provided the use
remains otherwise lawful.
§10.6.2. Movement
A nonconforming use, including a mobile home, may not be moved for any reason or for any
distance, unless when so moved, it complies with the regulations for the district in which it is
located. Further, any subsequent reuse of the lot or lots on which the nonconforming structure

provisions of this subsection shall not apply to involuntary movements of uses as a result of
condemnation actions or other litigation.
§10.6.3. Change in use
Once a nonconforming use has been changed or altered so as to comply with the provisions of

§10.6.4. Nonconforming sexually-oriented businesses
A. Any person or entity holding a certificate of occupancy for a lawful business and actually
operating a sexually oriented business on the effective date of this article, but not in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall be permitted to continue to
operate as a nonconforming sexually oriented business at the site of the previous use;
provided, however, that should such business cease to operate or be discontinued for any
period six months, it shall not thereafter be reestablished without being in full compliance
with all provisions of this chapter and other applicable codes and ordinances. The terms
"cease to operate" or "discontinued for any period of time" shall mean the voluntary or
intentional termination, cessation or discontinuance of the business by the owner or other
party in interest or an involuntary termination of the business resulting from a violation of
any applicable rule, regulation, ordinance, statute or law. The nonconforming use shall not
be deemed to terminate if the cessation, termination of discontinuance of the business
operations are caused by an act of God, or other catastrophic occurrence or event not
caused by or under the control of the business owner or other party in interest. The
holder of the certificate of occupancy or operator of the business shall be responsible for
providing documentation, acceptable to the planning director, that a nonconforming
