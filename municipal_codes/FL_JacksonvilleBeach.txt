PREFACE 
    This Code is a recodification of the ordinances of Jacksonville Beach, Florida of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1955 Jacksonville Beach Code as supplemented through December 15, 1975 and ordinances adopted subsequent thereto. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1955 Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    In 1990 the Code as amended through Supplement No. 13, containing legislation through November of 1987, was analyzed in light of state law changes resulting in republication in the eight and one-half by eleven format and readoption of the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The number system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixth section of Chapter 9 is 9-6. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 5-4 and 5-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-4.1, 5-4.2, 5-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number; e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Robert L. Laslie, Vice-President-Supplements, and Anne Wilson, Supplement Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to the City Attorney, Mr. Stephen Stratford, Assistant City Attorney, Mark M. Arnold, City Clerk, Bruce Corbitt and numerous other city officials for their supervision, cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code.

    The powers of the city shall be construed liberally in favor of the city, limited only by the constitution, general law and specific limitations contained herein. Future special acts pertaining to the jurisdiction and exercise of powers of this city shall be considered amendments to this Charter and, pursuant to the provisions adopted for incorporation of other charter amendments, shall be incorporated as official amendments to the charter. 
Section 3. - Creation, salary and composition of council. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, all powers of the city shall be vested in a council composed of a mayor and six (6) other members, three (3) of which shall be at-large members and three (3) of which shall be district members. The boundary for each of the three (3) districts is described in Appendix "A" of this Charter. The district boundaries shall be reapportioned every ten (10) years commencing with the 1990 Official Florida State and Federal Census. Each reapportionment shall be completed by the city council by ordinance enacted within six (6) months of the date of official publication of the most recent Official Florida State and Federal Census. District boundaries shall be reapportioned to create districts of nearly equal population. Districts shall be arranged in a logical and compact geographic pattern and shall promote fair representation. The mayor and the three (3) at-large members of the council shall be qualified electors of the city and shall be nominated and elected from the city at-large and the three (3) district council members shall be qualified electors of the city and shall also be residents of the district which they represent and shall be nominated and elected from the district they represent. The mayor and all councilpersons shall be elected in the manner hereinafter provided. The term of office of the mayor and all councilpersons shall be for four (4) years next following their election or until their successors are elected and qualified. A person serving as the mayor shall be limited to serving two (2) consecutive full-terms on the Council. A person serving as councilperson shall be limited to serving two (2) consecutive full-terms as councilperson, after which they are eligible to seek qualification to run for an additional two (2) consecutive terms as mayor. The maximum number of terms a councilperson moving from a city council seat to mayor may serve is a total of four (4) consecutive terms. The maximum number of terms a mayor can serve on the Council is two (2) consecutive terms. An individual who has served two (2) consecutive terms as Mayor shall not seek a consecutive term as a councilperson. A term shall be considered a full-term if the elector has served two or more years of their four (4) year term. Members of the city council and the mayor shall be bona fide residents of the City of Jacksonville Beach and, where applicable, the districts they represent and not a resident of any other city or district. Should any council member or the mayor move from the City of Jacksonville Beach, or, where applicable, the district they represent, during the term of office for which they were elected, then, in that event that office shall automatically become vacant from the date of such removal. The mayor or any member of the council ceasing to possess any of the qualifications specified in this Charter, or convicted of a felony while in office, or removed from office by recall election, shall immediately forfeit his office. 
B.  The salary of council members, together with the manner of payment, shall be established by resolution and shall be compatible with salaries as portrayed by the Florida League of Municipalities for cities and comparable size and form of government. No increase in salary shall become effective until the commencement of terms of members elected at the next regular city election. The council may provide that members shall receive an allowance for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. 
(Ord. No. 2009-7978, § 1(exh. A), 11-2-09)

The city council is hereby authorized to provide by ordinance for the issuance of special assessment certificates for such amounts and drawing such rates of interest and upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed necessary to enable the city to pay the cost of such work pending the collection of special assessments and taxes and to provide for the payment thereof with interest; and the city council shall, as soon as practicable and within thirty (30) days after the completion of any such work, by resolution, fix a special assessment, per front foot upon the abutting property or the special assessment against the platted lot to be benefited, as the case may be, at an amount not exceeding either the actual cost of the work, or the estimated special assessment stated in the ordinance providing for the work, which said resolution shall specify the amount of the cost of such work so assessed against the abutting or benefiting property and the fact that a lien has been assessed against such property with a breakdown of the specific amount which has been assessed against each particular parcel of property to be particularly described therein and shall provide that the city clerk shall forthwith have prepared and entered in a book, which shall be prepared and kept for that purpose, and kept open to the public for inspection during reasonable office hours, labeled "IMPROVEMENT LIEN BOOK", the amount of such lien assessed against each lot, the date of the completion of the work and such other information as may be deemed advisable. The city council shall cause said resolution to be published in a newspaper published in Duval County once each week for four (4) consecutive weeks, or by posting same at the city hall and two (2) other public placed in said city for a period of thirty (30) days. Any person desiring to contest in any manner the validity of any such special assessment or lien shall within thirty (30) days after the publication or posting at the city hall and two (2) other public places in said city of the resolution fixing the special assessments, institute suit to have the enforcement thereof enjoined, or its validity legally declared, and any person not instituting such suit shall not thereafter be heard to question the validity thereof, or to defend against the enforcement of the lien upon the grounds of its invalidity. Any such special assessment paid within thirty (30) days after the publication or posting of such resolution shall be accepted without interest and such assessment not paid within said time shall bear interest from the date of publication or posting of such resolution at a rate not to exceed eight (8) percent per year.

DIVISION 5. - GENERAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM 

Sec. 2-162.1. - Name, establishment; effective date. 
    The City of Jacksonville Beach General Employees' Retirement System established effective November 1, 1951, is continued for the purpose of providing retirement income to qualifying employees and former employees, and survivor income to their qualifying beneficiaries. The effective date of the retirement system is November 1, 1951. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7781, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-162.2. - Definitions. 
    As used in this division: 
    Accumulated member contributions means the sum of all amounts credited to a member's individual account in the reserve for member contributions. 
    Beneficiary means an individual who is being paid or who has entitlement to the future payment of a pension on account of a reason other than the individual's membership in the retirement system. 
    Compensation means the salary or wages paid a member for personal services rendered the city while a member of the retirement system. Salary and wages shall include longevity pay; overtime pay, shift differentials; incentive pay, pay for periods of absence from work by reason of vacation, holiday, and sickness; and deferred compensation amounts under deferred compensation programs recognized by the board of trustees. Compensation shall not include any remuneration or reimbursement not specifically stated to be included, such as allowances for clothing, equipment, cleaning, and travel; reimbursement of expenses; bonuses; termination of pay; severance pay; payments in consideration of unused vacation or sick leave; and the value of fringe benefits. Notwithstanding the preceding two (2) sentences, effective November 25, 2013 for any member who has not reached age sixty (60) with five (5) or more years of credited service or thirty (30) or more years of credited service as of that date, compensation shall mean base pay and longevity pay, and shall exclude overtime pay and all other payments. For the purpose of this definition, overtime pay means pay for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, a member's annual compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be disregarded. However, for those members who commence participation in the retirement system prior to the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995, the limitation on compensation shall not be less than the amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the retirement system as in effect on July 1, 1993. 
    Final average compensation means one-fifth of the aggregate amount of compensation paid a member during the sixty (60) months of the member's last one hundred twenty (120) months credited service in which the aggregate amount of compensation paid is greatest, if the member has at least sixty (60) months of credited service. If the member has less than sixty (60) months of credited service, "final average compensation" means the aggregate amount of compensation paid a member divided by the member's credited service. 
    Pension means an annual amount payable, in monthly installments, by the retirement system. Payment may be for a temporary period or throughout the future life of a retirant or beneficiary. 
    Retirant means an individual who is being paid a retirement allowance on account of the individual's membership in the retirement system. 
    Service means personal service rendered the city while a member of the retirement system and qualifying military service pursuant to section 2-162.5.

Should any such member elect to discontinue participation in the retirement system, the retirement system shall return to such member all accumulated member contributions pursuant to the procedures described in section 2-162.22. If a member previously elected not to participate in the retirement system and later chooses to participate, the individual shall be required to pay to the retirement system any accumulated member contributions that were withdrawn from the retirement system, if any, and shall pay all member and employer contributions for the time that the person did not participate in the retirement system plus a rate of interest to equal to the plan's assumed rate of return for the service purchased, as determined by the fund actuary.

Sec. 2-162.9. - Amount of a pension. 
(a)  (1)  The amount of pension under optional form of payment SL pursuant to section 2-162.10 shall be equal to the sum of separate amounts determined in accordance with the benefit formula applicable to each retirement system for which the retiring individual has credited service in force.

The fraction shall be the individual's credited service under the retirement system over the individual's total credited service. 
(b)  The benefit formula is: 
  For retirements with an effective date prior to October 1, 1990, two (2) percent of final average compensation multiplied by credited service, to a maximum of sixty (60) percent of final average compensation. 
  For retirements with an effective date after September 30, 1990, and before November 25, 2013, two and one-half percent (21/2) of final average compensation multiplied by credited service, to a maximum of seventy-five (75) percent of final average compensation. 
  For retirements with an effective date on or after November 25, 2013, for a member who has not reached normal retirement eligibility on that date, two and one-half percent (21/2) of final average compensation multiplied by credited service, to a maximum of seventy-five (75) percent of final average compensation or ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00) annually, whichever is less; provided, any member who has an accrued benefit as of November 25, 2013 in excess of ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00) which is not greater than seventy-five (75) percent of the member's final average compensation, shall retain the accrued benefit but not accrue any additional benefit after that date. 
  Notwithstanding the above, there shall be a minimum monthly benefit provided to retirants who have been retired for thirty (30) or more years or have accumulated ten (10) or more years of credited service, as periodically established by the city. Such monthly benefit shall be reduced by the applicable survivor benefit as elected by the retirant pursuant to section 2-162.10. The city shall make deposits into the general employees' retirement system equal to the full annual cost of such increase in benefit payments to achieve said minimum monthly benefit. 
(c)  Payment of a pension granted under the provisions of section 2-162.7 with respect to normal retirement shall be suspended if the retirant becomes employed in a full-time regular position with the city. Suspension of payments shall become effective the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following employment. Payment of the pension shall resume, without change in amount or conditions by reason of the employment, on the first day of the calendar month next following termination of employment. The employed retirant shall not be a member during the period of employment following retirement. 
(d)  Deferred Retirement Option Program. In general, and subject to the provisions of this section, the Deferred Retirement Option Program, hereinafter referred to as the DROP, is a program under which an eligible member of the retirement system may elect to participate, deferring receipt of retirement benefits while continuing employment with the city. The deferred monthly benefits shall accrue in the reserve for pension payments fund on behalf of the participant, plus interest compounded monthly, for the specified period of the DROP participation, as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section. Upon termination of employment, the participant shall receive the total DROP benefits and begin to receive the previously determined normal retirement benefits. Employment in the DROP does not guarantee employment for the specified period of DROP. 
(1)  Eligibility of member to participate in the DROP. All retirement system members are eligible to elect participation in the DROP provided that election to participate is made on or after the member first reaches normal retirement date or age and prior to November 25, 2013. The member shall advise the city and the retirement system in writing of the date on which the DROP shall begin. The DROP shall be closed to new members on November 25, 2013. 
(2)  Participation in the DROP. 
a.  An eligible member may elect to participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed a maximum of thirty-six (36) consecutive months. Any member who has exceeded the 36-month limitation shall not be eligible to participate in the DROP. 
b.  Upon deciding to participate in the DROP, the member shall submit on forms required by the retirement system: 
1.  A written election to participate in the DROP. 
2.  Selection of the DROP participation and termination dates, which satisfy the limitations stated in subsections (d)(1) and (d)(2)a. of this section. Such termination date shall be in a binding letter of resignation with the city, establishing a deferred termination date. The member may terminate before the termination date within the limitations of subsection (d)(2)a., but only with advance written notice to the city. 
3.  A properly completed DROP application for service retirement as provided in this section. 
4.  A written election of form of pension payment, pursuant to section 2-162.10. 
5.  Any other information required by the retirement system. 
c.  The DROP participant shall be a retirant under the retirement system for all purposes except that payment of benefits to the retirant shall be deferred until separation from city employment. 
d.  A re-employed retirant with renewed membership is not eligible for DROP participation. 
(3)  Benefits payable under the DROP. 
a.  Effective with the date of DROP participation, the member's initial normal monthly benefit, including credited service and final average compensation, shall be fixed. Such retirement benefit, any annual cost-of-living adjustments which may be provided, and interest shall accrue monthly in the retirement system's reserve for pension payments. Such interest shall accrue at an annual rate set quarterly by the board of trustees, which shall not be less than three and one-half (3.5) percent compounded monthly, on the prior month's accumulated ending balance, up to the month of termination or death. An annual administration fee of three-quarters of one (0.75) percent shall be deducted from each DROP participant's accrued benefits, prorated monthly. 
b.  The effective date of retirement of a DROP participant shall be the first day of the month selected by the member to begin participation in the DROP. 
c.  Normal retirement benefits and interest thereon shall continue to accrue in the DROP until the established termination date of the DROP, or until the participant terminates employment or dies prior to such date. Although individual DROP accounts shall not be established, a separate accounting of each participant's accrued benefits under the DROP shall be calculated and provided to participants annually. 
d.  At the conclusion of the participant's DROP, the retirement system shall distribute the participant's total accumulated DROP benefits, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  The retirement system shall receive verification from the city that the participant has terminated employment. 
2.  The terminated DROP participant or if deceased, such participant's named beneficiary, shall elect on forms provided by the retirement system to receive payment of the DROP benefits in accordance with one (1) of the options listed below. For a participant or beneficiary who fails to elect a method of payment within sixty (60) days of termination of the DROP, the retirement system will pay a lump sum as provided in (I). 
(I)  Lump sum. All accrued DROP benefits, plus interest, less withholding taxes remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, shall be paid to the DROP participant or surviving beneficiary. 
(II)  Direct rollover. All accrued DROP benefits, plus interest, shall be paid from the DROP directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as defined in Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased participant, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as described in Section 402(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(III)  Partial lump sum. A portion of the accrued DROP benefits shall be paid to the DROP participant or surviving spouse, less withholding taxes remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, and the remaining DROP benefits shall be transferred directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as defined in Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased participant, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as described in Section 402(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. The proportions shall be specified by the DROP participant or surviving beneficiary. 
3.  Regardless of the form of payout, a participant's DROP account continues until the account balance is exhausted. 
4.  For a DROP participant who fails to terminate city employment at the expiration of the 36-month maximum DROP participation period, the member shall be deemed not to be retired, the DROP election shall be null and void, and the member shall have no accumulated DROP benefits. Retirement system membership shall be reestablished retroactively to the date of the commencement of the DROP, and the member shall be required to pay to the retirement system the member contributions at the rate set forth in section 2-162.20, and the city contributions, as established pursuant to section 2-162.32, required during the period the member participated in the DROP, plus six and one-half (6.5) percent interest compounded annually. 
e.  The accrued benefits of any DROP participant, and any contributions accumulated under such program, shall not be subject to assignment or attachment. 
f.  DROP participants shall not be eligible for disability retirement benefits as provided in sections 2-162.15, 2-162.16, 2-162.17, and 2-162.18, and the participant's beneficiaries and survivors shall not be eligible for the automatic survivor pension, death in the line of duty pension, or survivor pension as provided respectively in sections 2-162.12, 2-162.13, and 2-162.14. 
(4)  Death benefits under the DROP. 
a.  Upon the death of a DROP participant, the named beneficiary shall be entitled to apply for and receive the accrued benefits in the DROP as provided in subsection (d)(3)d.2. of this section 
b.  The normal retirement benefit accrued to the DROP during the month of a participant's death shall be the final monthly benefit credited for such DROP participant. 
c.  Eligibility to participate in the DROP terminates upon death of the participant. If the participant dies on or after the effective date of enrollment in the DROP, but prior to the first monthly benefit being credited to the DROP, retirement system benefits shall be paid as though the DROP election had not been made. 
(5)  Contributions. 
a.  Member contributions shall not be made, due, or payable during a participant's DROP participation, section 2-162.20 hereof notwithstanding. 
b.  The city shall not pick up member contributions of a DROP participant during a participant's DROP participation; section 2-162.21 hereof notwithstanding, but instead shall be paid to the DROP participant as wages or salary. 
(6)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the scope of Section 8(d), Art. II of the State Constitution, and §112.3173, Florida Statutes, DROP participants who commit a specified felony offense while employed will be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits, pursuant to those provisions of law. 
(7)  Administration of program. The board of trustees shall make such rules as are necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this subsection. The retirement system shall not be required to advise members of the federal tax consequences of an election related to the DROP but may advise members to seek independent advice. 
(e)  Back-DROP. Effective November 25, 2013, and subject to the provisions of this section, eligible members may elect to participate in the Back-DROP in accordance with this subsection (f). 
(1)  Eligibility of member to participate in the Back-DROP. A member who is employed and not participating in DROP on November 25, 2013, and continues employment beyond the normal retirement date and any member who reaches normal retirement eligibility on or after November 25, 2013 and continues employment beyond the normal retirement date, is eligible to elect the Back-DROP. The member shall advise the city and the retirement system in writing of their Back-DROP election prior to separation from employment. A member may elect the Back-DROP only once.

The lump sum Back-DROP benefit, less applicable withholding taxes, shall be distributed to the member within sixty (60) days following separation from employment. Alternatively, a member may elect to roll some or all of the lump sum Back-DROP benefit into an IRA or other qualified retirement plan, in accordance with applicable law.

At the expiration of a period of three (3) years from the date an individual without entitlement to a vested termination pension provided in section 2-162.8 ceases to be a member, any balance in the reserve for accumulated member contributions unclaimed by the individual or the individual's legal representative shall be transferred to the reserve for undistributed investment income.

Sec. 2-162.31. - Reserve for pension payments. 
(a)  The reserve for pension payments is the account to which is credited contributions made by the city to the retirement system, all interest, dividends, and other income from the investment of retirement system assets; all gifts and bequests received by the retirement system; and all other moneys received by the retirement system the disposition of which is not specifically provided for, and from which shall be paid all pensions and refunds required by section 2-162.11. 
(b)  The retirement system shall be funded by the city in compliance with the requirements of Section 14, Art. X of the State Constitution and Chapter 112, Part VII, Florida Statutes. 
(c)  City contributions to the retirement system each fiscal year which, together with the contributions made by members during the fiscal year, shall be sufficient to fully fund the cost of benefits likely to be paid on account of service rendered by members during the year and to finance unfunded costs of benefits likely to be paid on account of service rendered by members prior to the current year over periods established by the trustees which shall not exceed the maximum periods specified in Chapter 112, Part VII, Florida Statutes. The contributions shall be computed by actuarial valuation as level percents of member payroll in accordance with generally recognized actuarial principles. The city shall also contribute the anticipated cost of any other benefits provided retirants and beneficiaries through the retirement system. The board of trustees shall annually certify to the city council and the city manager the contributions determined according to this section, and the city council shall appropriate and pay to the retirement system the contributions so certified. 
(d)  Should a disability pension be terminated and the retirant be returned to the employ of the city, the excess of the retirant's accumulated member contributions at the time of retirement over the aggregate amount of pension paid shall be transferred from the reserve for pension payments to the reserve for accumulated member contributions.

(Ord. No. 2000-7781, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-162.36A. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(a)  Maximum amount of retirement income. 
(1)  The limitations of this subsection (a) shall apply in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein, and are intended to comply with the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and shall be construed in accordance with said Act and guidance issued thereunder. The provisions of this subsection (a) shall supersede any provision of the plan to the extent such provision is inconsistent with this subsection. 
The annual pension as defined in paragraph (2) below otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the dollar limitation for the member multiplied by a fraction whose value cannot exceed one (1), the numerator of which is the member's number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one (1) year) of service with the city and the denominator of which is ten (10). For this purpose, no more than one (1) year of service may be credited for any plan year. If the benefit the member would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(2)  "Annual pension" means the sum of all annual benefits, payable in the form of a straight life annuity. Benefits payable in any other form shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
(A)  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007: 
(I)  The straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit, or 
(II)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
(B)  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007 
(I)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan for the particular form of payment, or 
(II)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to § 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this subsection (a), and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
(3)  "Dollar limitation" means, effective for the first limitation year beginning after January 1, 2001, one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00), automatically adjusted under Code Section 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new limitation shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a member's benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year. The dollar limitation shall be further adjusted based on the age of the member when the benefit begins as follows: 
(A)  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007: 
(I)  If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age sixty-five (65): 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)(A)(I)(i) of this subsection (a). For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65) is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical member who is age sixty-five (65) and has the same accrued benefit as the member. 
(II)  Except with respect to a member who is a "qualified member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code), if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is before age sixty-two (62): 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-two (62), both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)(A)(II)(i) of this subsection (a). 
(B)  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. 
Age as of Annuity Starting Date: Adjustment of Dollar Limitation: Over 65 The smaller of: 
(a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using a 5.00% interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). Any increase in the dollar limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph shall not reflect a mortality decrement between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 62 to 65 No adjustment. Less than 62 The smaller of: 
(a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using a 5.00% interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). This adjustment shall not apply to any "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H), nor to survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code.  
(4)  With respect to clause (3)(A)(I)(i), clause (3)(A)(II)(i) and paragraph (3)(B) above, no adjustment shall be made to the dollar limitation to reflect the probability of a member's death between the annuity starting date and age sixty-two (62), or between age sixty-five (65) and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member's death if the plan does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in Code Section 417(c), upon the member's death. 
(5)  The term "limitation year" is the 12-month period which is used for application of the limitations under Code Section 415 and shall be the calendar year. 
(6)  The limitations set forth in this subsection (a) shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) provided the member has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(7)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section Subsection 415(d) of the Code. 
(8)  In the case of a member who has fewer than ten (10) years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection (a) shall be multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is 10. 
(9)  Any portion of a member's benefit that is attributable to mandatory member contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the Code. 
(10)  Should any member participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the member's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the member's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the member's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(11)  For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(12)  The determination of the annual pension under paragraph (A)(1) of this subsection (a) shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the Code) social security supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(13)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of the Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (a) and the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (a) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(14)  For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, Compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the member and which is not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 125 or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this subsection (a), compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years on or after July 1, 2007, compensation shall include payments that otherwise qualify as compensation and that are made by the later of: (a) two and one-half (21/2) months after severance from employment with the employer, and (b) the end of the limitation year that includes the date of severance. 
(b)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
 April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of seventy and one-half (701/2) years; or 
 April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(c)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in subsection (b) of this section 2-162.36A. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
(A)  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(i)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later. 
(ii)  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(iii)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(B)  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
(i)  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subparagraph (2)(A) above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(I)  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
(II)  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(ii)  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(C)  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
(A)  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
(B)  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age seventy (70) under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of seventy (70) over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph (3)(B), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs (4)(A), (4)(B) and (4)(C) below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(A)  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
(ii)  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs (2) or (3) above, whichever is applicable, of this subsection (c); 
(iii)  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
(iv)  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(I)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(II)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code; 
(III)  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
(IV)  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
(B)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subparagraph (2)(A)(i) or (2)(A)(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
(C)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  [Beginning date.] For purposes of this subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph (2)(A) above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
(A)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the Treasury regulations. 
(B)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (c). 
(C)  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(d)  (1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section: 
(A)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
(i)  Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; 
(ii)  Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; 
(iii)  The portion of any distribution which is made upon hardship of the member; and 
(iv)  The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
(3)  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust described in Section 401 (a) of the Code, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of Code Section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
(4)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former Employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code or an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code shall be considered a distributee. 
(5)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  [Maximum mandatory distribution.] Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, payable under the plan shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
(f)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17). In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding twelve (12) months, over which Compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). 
    Any reference in the plan to the limitation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(g)  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Sec. 2-162.38. - Subrogation. 
(a)  The retirement system has a right of subrogation against any third-party tortfeasor or insurance carriers representing such third-party tortfeasor, to the extent that the retirement system becomes obligated to make any disability benefit payments to a member as a result of injuries caused by the third-party tortfeasor. 
(b)  A member shall execute a subrogation agreement on a form provided by the retirement system or such other documents, which may be necessary to document the retirement system's subrogation rights. The member shall notify the retirement system of any claim or legal action asserted against any party or insurance carrier for such injuries and shall notify the retirement system of the name and address of such party and any insurance carrier. The member shall take no action inconsistent with the requirements of this section, nor settle any claim without obtaining the prior consent of the retirement system. 
(c)  The retirement system's subrogation rights shall not be subject to equitable distribution or to any reduction for costs or attorneys' fees incurred by the member in pursuit of his or her claim against a third-party tortfeasor or any insurance carrier. Further, the retirement system's subrogation rights shall not be subject to reduction regardless of whether the member recovers the full value of his or her claim against a third-party and/or any insurance carrier. 
(d)  In the event that the member fails to execute a subrogation agreement, or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this section, then such shall be considered a breach of this retirement system and disability pension benefits may be denied and/or discontinued by the board of trustees upon a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis.

The recovery of overpayments may be accomplished by reducing the amount of future payments so that the actuarial present value of actual payments to the recipient is equal to the actuarial present value of the payments to which the recipient was correctly entitled. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7781, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-162.40. - Liability.

    The city intends the retirement system to be a qualified pension plan under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or successor provisions of law and that the trust be an exempt organization in compliance with Section 501 of said code. The board of trustees may adopt such additional provisions to the retirement system as are necessary to fulfill the intent of being a qualified pension plan. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7781, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-162.42. - Severability. 
    If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the Act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are declared severable. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7781, § 1, 2-7-00)

(a)  Merger. This retirement system shall not merge or consolidate with any other retirement system or pension plan, nor transfer any assets or liabilities to any other retirement system or pension plan, unless each member and beneficiary of the retirement system will receive a benefit immediately after such merger, consolidation, or transfer which is at least equal to the benefit the member or beneficiary was entitled to immediately before such merger, consolidation, or transfer. 
(b)  Termination. In the event of termination of the retirement system, the board of trustees shall follow the procedures contained in Florida Statutes and the Internal Revenue Code.

DIVISION 6. - POLICE OFFICERS' RETIREMENT SYSTEM 

Sec. 2-163.1. - Name, establishment; effective date. 
    The City of Jacksonville Beach Police Officers' Retirement System established effective November 1, 1951, is continued for the purpose of providing retirement income to qualifying employees and former employees, and survivor income to their qualifying beneficiaries. The effective date of the retirement system is November 1, 1951. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7782, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-163.2. - Definitions: 
    As used in this division: 
    Accumulated member contributions means the sum of all amounts credited to a member's individual account in the reserve for member contributions. 
    Beneficiary means an individual who is being paid or who has entitlement to the future payment of a pension on account of a reason other than the individual's membership in the retirement system. 
    City means the City of Jacksonville Beach, Florida. 
    Compensation means the salary or wages paid a member for personal services rendered the city while a member of the retirement system. Salary and wages shall include longevity pay; overtime pay, shift differentials; incentive pay, pay for periods of absence from work by reason of vacation, holiday, and sickness; and deferred compensation amounts under deferred compensation programs recognized by the board of trustees. Effective January 1, 2009, compensation shall also include payments in consideration of unused vacation or sick leave up to a maximum of seven hundred fifty (750) hours. Compensation shall not include any remuneration or reimbursement not specifically stated to be included, such as allowances for clothing, equipment, cleaning, and travel; reimbursement of expenses; bonuses; termination of pay; severance pay; and the value of fringe benefits. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, a member's annual compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be disregarded. However, for those members who commence participation in the retirement system prior to the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995, the limitation on compensation shall not be less than the amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the retirement system as in effect on July 1, 1993. Effective June 23, 2014, compensation shall include base pay, longevity pay, incentive pay, and overtime pay in an amount not to exceed three hundred (300) hours per calendar year; and shall exclude overtime pay in excess of three hundred (300) hours per calendar year, leave payouts and all other compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per calendar year accrued as of June 23, 2014 and attributable to service earned prior to June 23, 2014, shall be included in compensation even if payment is not made until on or after that date. 
    Final average compensation means one-fifth of the aggregate amount of compensation paid a member during the sixty (60) months of the member's last one hundred twenty (120) months credited service in which the aggregate amount of compensation paid is greatest. If the member has less than sixty (60) months of credited service, "final average compensation" means the aggregate amount of compensation paid a member divided by the member's credited service. 
    Pension means an annual amount payable, in monthly installments, by the retirement system. Payment may be for a temporary period or throughout the future life of a retirant or beneficiary. 
    Police officer means any person who is employed full time by the city, who is certified or required to be certified as a law enforcement officer in compliance with §§ 943.1395 and 185.02(11), Florida Statutes, and who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, criminal, traffic, or highway laws of the state. This definition includes all certified supervisory and command personnel whose duties include, in whole or in part, the supervision, training, guidance, and management responsibilities of full-time law enforcement officers. 
    Retirant means an individual who is being paid a retirement allowance on account of the individual's membership in the retirement system. 
    Retirement system means the police officers' retirement system. 
    Service means personal service rendered the city while a member of the retirement system and qualifying military service pursuant to section 2-163.5.

(1)  Reserve police officers; 
(2)  Any person initially employed as or promoted to a position designated by the city council, as the police chief shall elect, within ninety (90) days of initial employment or promotion, to participate or not participate in the retirement system. Such election may be revoked only one (1) time prior to vesting, after which no further participation changes shall be allowed. Should any such member elect to discontinue participation in the retirement system, the retirement system shall return to such member all accumulated member contributions pursuant to the procedures described in section 2-163.22. If a member previously elected not to participate in the retirement system and later chooses to participate, the individual shall be required to pay to the retirement system any accumulated member contributions that were withdrawn from the retirement system, if any, and shall pay all member and employer contributions for the time that the person did not participate in the retirement system plus a rate of interest equal to the plan's assumed rate of return for the service purchased, as determined by the fund actuary.

(b)  Credited service shall be forfeited and no longer in force in the event an individual has a break in membership or in the event an individual's accumulated member contributions are paid to the individual or the individual's beneficiary, including an estate. Provided that a member may voluntarily leave his or her contributions in the fund for a period of not more than five (5) years after leaving employment of the city, pending the possibility of being rehired by the city as a police officer, without losing credit for the time he or she had participated as a member of the fund.

Credited service shall be restored by paying the retirement system the total amount of accumulated member contributions previously withdrawn, plus compound interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. The rate of interest shall be equal to the rate of interest used to compute the contribution requirement under section 2-163.32.

In the event that a vested former member shall die from any cause before that member is eligible to retire as provided by section 2-163.7, then in that event the benefits of this Act granted to non-duty, death-in-service automatic survivor's pension shall go to the surviving beneficiaries of the vested former member.

(b)  The benefit formula is: 
(1)  For retirements with an effective date prior to October 1, 1990, two and one-half (21/2) percent of final average compensation multiplied by credited service, to a maximum of seventy-five (75) percent of final average compensation.

(c)  Payment of a pension granted under the provisions of section 2-163.7 with respect to normal retirement shall be suspended if the retirant becomes employed by the city. Suspension of payment shall become effective the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following employment. Payment of the pension shall resume, without change in amount or conditions by reason of the employment, on the first day of the calendar month next following termination of employment. The employed retirant shall not be a member during the period of employment following retirement. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this act, a member may not receive a benefit, which exceeds the maximum amount allowed under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
(e)  Deferred Retirement Option Program. In general, and subject to the provisions of this section, the Deferred Retirement Option Program, hereinafter referred to as the DROP, is a program under which an eligible member of the retirement system may elect to participate prior to June 23, 2014, deferring receipt of retirement benefits while continuing employment with the city. The deferred monthly benefits shall accrue in the reserve for pension payments fund on behalf of the participant, plus interest compounded monthly, for the specified period of the DROP participation, as provided in subsection (e)(3) of this section. Upon termination of employment, the participant shall receive the total DROP benefits and begin to receive the previously determined normal retirement benefits. Employment in the DROP does not guarantee employment for the specified period of DROP. 
(1)  Eligibility of member to participate in the DROP. All retirement system members are eligible to elect participation in the DROP provided that election to participate is made prior to June 23, 2014 and on or after the member first reaches normal retirement date or age. The member shall advise the city and the retirement system in writing of the date on which the DROP shall begin. The DROP shall be closed to new members on June 23, 2014. 
(2)  Participation in the DROP. 
a.  An eligible member may elect to participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed a maximum of thirty-six (36) consecutive months. Any member who has exceeded the thirty-six-month limitation shall not be eligible to participate in the DROP. 
b.  Upon deciding to participate in the DROP, the member shall submit on forms required by the retirement system: 
1.  A written election to participate in the DROP. 
2.  Selection of the DROP participation and termination dates, which satisfy the limitations stated in subsections (d)(1) and (d)(2)a. of this section. Such termination date shall be in a binding letter of resignation with the city, establishing a deferred termination date. The member may terminate before the termination date within the limitations of subsection (d)(2)a. of this section, but only with advance written notice to the city. 
3.  A properly completed DROP application for service retirement as provided in this section. 
4.  A written election of form of pension payment, pursuant to section 2-163.10. 
5.  Any other information required by the retirement system. 
c.  The DROP participant shall be a retirant under the retirement system for all purposes except that payment of benefits to the retirant shall be deferred until separation from city employment. 
d.  A re-employed retirant with renewed membership is not eligible for DROP participation. 
(3)  Benefits payable under the DROP. 
a.  Effective with the date of DROP participation, the member's initial normal monthly benefit, including credited service and final average compensation, shall be fixed. Such retirement benefit, any annual cost-of-living adjustments which may be provided, and interest shall accrue monthly in the retirement system's reserve for pension payments. Such interest shall accrue at an annual rate set quarterly by the board of trustees, which shall not be less than three and one-half (3.5) percent compounded monthly, on the prior month's accumulated ending balance, up to the month of termination or death. An annual administration fee of three-quarters of one (0.75) percent shall be deducted from each DROP participant's accrued benefits, prorated monthly. 
b.  The effective date of retirement of a DROP participant shall be the first day of the month selected by the member to begin participation in the DROP. 
c.  Normal retirement benefits and interest thereon shall continue to accrue in the DROP until the established termination date of the DROP, or until the participant terminates employment or dies prior to such date. Although individual DROP accounts shall not be established, a separate accounting of each participant's accrued benefits under the DROP shall be calculated and provided to participants annually. 
d.  At the conclusion of the participant's DROP, the retirement system shall distribute the participant's total accumulated DROP benefits, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  The retirement system shall receive verification from the city that the participant has terminated employment. 
2.  The terminated DROP participant or if deceased, such participant's named beneficiary, shall elect on forms provided by the retirement system to receive payment of the DROP benefits in accordance with one of the options listed below. For a participant or beneficiary who fails to elect a method of payment within sixty (60) days of termination of the DROP, the retirement system will pay a lump sum as provided in (I). 
(I)  Lump sum. All accrued DROP benefits, plus interest, less withholding taxes remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, shall be paid to the DROP participant or surviving beneficiary. 
(II)  Direct rollover. All accrued DROP benefits, plus interest, shall be paid from the DROP directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as defined in Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased participant, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as described in Section 402(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(III)  Partial lump sum. A portion of the accrued DROP benefits shall be paid to the DROP participant or surviving spouse, less withholding taxes remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, and the remaining DROP benefits shall be transferred directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as defined in Section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased participant, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as described in Section 402(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. The proportions shall be specified by the DROP participant or surviving beneficiary. 
3.  Regardless of the form of payout, a participant's DROP account continues until the account balance is exhausted. 
4.  For a DROP participant who fails to terminate city employment at the expiration of the 36-month maximum DROP participation period, the member shall be deemed not to be retired, the DROP election shall be null and void, and the member shall have no accumulated DROP benefits. Retirement system membership shall be reestablished retroactively to the date of the commencement of the DROP, and the member shall be required to pay to the retirement system the member contributions at the rate set forth in section 2.163.20, and the city contributions, as established pursuant to section 2-163.32, required during the period the member participated in the DROP, plus six and one-half (6.5) percent interest compounded annually. 
e.  The accrued benefits of any DROP participant, and any contributions accumulated under such program, shall not be subject to assignment or attachment. 
f.  DROP participants shall not be eligible for disability retirement benefits as provided in sections 2-163.15, 2-163.16, 2-163.17, and 2-163.18, and the participant's beneficiaries and survivors shall not be eligible for the automatic survivor pension, death in the line of duty pension, or survivor pension as provided respectively in sections 2-163.12, 2-163.13, and 2-163.14. 
(4)  Death benefits under the DROP. 
a.  Upon the death of a DROP participant, the named beneficiary shall be entitled to apply for and receive the accrued benefits in the DROP as provided in subparagraph (d)(3)d.2. of this section. 
b.  The normal retirement benefit accrued to the DROP during the month of a participant's death shall be the final monthly benefit credited for such DROP participant. 
c.  Eligibility to participate in the DROP terminates upon death of the participant. If the participant dies on or after the effective date of enrollment in the DROP, but prior to the first monthly benefit being credited to the DROP, retirement system benefits shall be paid as though the DROP election had not been made. 
(5)  Contributions.

Sec. 2-163.10. - Forms of payment of a pension. 
    A member or a vested member may elect to have pension payments made under any one of the following forms of payment and name a survivor beneficiary. The election and naming of a survivor beneficiary shall be in writing and filed with the retirement system prior to the date the first pension payment is made. An election of form of payment may not be changed on or after the date the first pension payment is made. A named survivor beneficiary may be changed on or after the date the first pension payment is made up to two (2) times as provided in § 175.333, Florida Statutes, without the approval of the board of trustees or the current survivor beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good health of the survivor beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. After any such change in joint survivor or beneficiary, the member's pension benefit will be recalculated accordingly by the actuary and their retirement income shall be payable to the member based on the new calculation. A named survivor beneficiary may be more than one person if Form of Payment I is elected. Payment shall be made under Form of Payment I if there is not a timely election of form of payment. The amount of pension under Forms of Payment I, II, and III, shall have the same actuarial present value, computed as of the date of retirement, as the amount of pension under Form of Payment I. 
(1)  Form of Payment I (Life with Period Certain Guarantee). Under Form of Payment I, the retirant is paid a reduced pension for life. Upon the death of the retirant during the guaranteed period, the named survivor beneficiary is paid the full amount of the Form of Payment I pension for remainder of the guaranteed period. The guaranteed period is one hundred twenty (120) months. The actuarial present value of remaining guaranteed pension payments shall be paid to the legal representative of the retirant or the named survivor beneficiary, whichever survives the longest, if both the retirant and named survivor beneficiary die during the guaranteed period. 
(2)  Form of Payment II (Life with Full Continuation to Survivor Beneficiary). Under Form of Payment II, the retirant is paid a reduced pension until the retirant dies. Upon death of the retirant during the lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor beneficiary is paid the full amount of the reduced Form of Payment II pension over the named survivor beneficiary's remaining life. 
(3)  Form of Payment III (Life with reduced Continuation to Survivor Beneficiary). Under Form of Payment III, the retirant is paid a reduced pension until the retirant dies. Upon the death of the retirant during the lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor beneficiary is paid one-half (1/2), two-thirds ( 2/3 ) or three-fourths (3/4) of the amount of the reduced Form of Payment III pension over the named survivor beneficiary's remaining life. 
(4)  Form of Payment IV (Straight Life or Lifetime Annuity). A retirement income of larger monthly amount, payable to the retirant for his or her lifetime only. 
(5)  Pop-up on election of Form of Payment II or Form of Payment III. All members who enter the DROP or retire on or after October 1, 2009, shall have an automatic pop-up provision configured into their form of payment election. If a member of the DROP or retirant has elected either Form of Payment II or Form of Payment III, and the designated survivor pre-deceases them after benefit payments have commenced, then the retirant's benefit shall be recalculated and automatically revert to the Form of Payment SL as of the date of death of the named survivor beneficiary. Election of a joint and last survivor option and its accompanying pop-up protection shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Form of Payment SL. 
(6)  DROP participant pop-up. Effective October 1, 2009, benefit calculations for current DROP participants that elected Form of Payment II or Form of Payment III shall be recalculated retroactively to the member's DROP entry date to include the automatic pop-up provided for herein. All costs associated with such recalculation, including interest as determined by the board, shall be borne by the DROP participant and automatically deducted from their DROP account balance as of October 1, 2009. DROP participants that elected Form of Payment II or Form of Payment III shall have the option of retaining their original benefit calculation without the pop-up by notifying the pension board of trustees in writing within sixty (60) days of the enactment of this provision.

Sec. 2-163.36A. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(a)  Maximum amount of retirement income. 
(1)  The limitations of this subsection (a) shall apply in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein, and are intended to comply with the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and shall be construed in accordance with said Act and guidance issued thereunder. The provisions of this subsection (a) shall supersede any provision of the plan to the extent such provision is inconsistent with this subsection. 
The annual pension as defined in paragraph (2) below otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the dollar limitation for the member multiplied by a fraction whose value cannot exceed one, the numerator of which is the member's number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of service with the city and the denominator of which is 10. For this purpose, no more than one year of service may be credited for any plan year. If the benefit the member would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(2)  "Annual pension" means the sum of all annual benefits, payable in the form of a straight life annuity. Benefits payable in any other form shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
(A)  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. 
(I)  The straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit, or 
(II)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
(B)  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. 
(I)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan for the particular form of payment, or 
(II)  The actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this subsection (a), and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
(3)  "Dollar limitation" means, effective for the first limitation year beginning after January 1, 2001, one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00), automatically adjusted under Code Section 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new limitation shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a member's benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year. The dollar limitation shall be further adjusted based on the age of the member when the benefit begins as follows: 
(A)  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. 
(I)  If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age sixty-five (65): 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)(A)(I)(i) of this subsection (a). For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65) is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical member who is age sixty-five (65) and has the same Accrued Benefit as the member. 
(II)  Except with respect to a member who is a "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code), if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is before age sixty-two (62): 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-two (62), both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)(A)(II)(i) of this subsection (a). 
(B)  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. 
Age as of Annuity Starting Date: Adjustment of Dollar Limitation: Over 65 The smaller of: 
(a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using a 5.00% interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). Any increase in the dollar limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph shall not reflect a mortality decrement between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 62 to 65 No adjustment. Less than 62 The smaller of: 
(a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using a 5.00% interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). This adjustment shall not apply to any "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H). nor to survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code.  
(4)  With respect to clause (3)(A)(I)(i), clause (3)(A)(II)(i) and paragraph (3)(B) above, no adjustment shall be made to the dollar limitation to reflect the probability of a member's death between the annuity starting date and age sixty-two (62), or between age sixty-five (65) and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member's death if the plan does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in Code Section 417(c), upon the member's death. 
(5)  The term "limitation year" is the 12-month period, which is used for application of the limitations under Code Section 415 and shall be the calendar year. 
(6)  The limitations set forth in this subsection (a) shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) provided the member has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(7)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section Subsection 415(d) of the Code. 
(8)  In the case of a member who has fewer than ten (10) years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in Paragraph (3) of this Subsection (a) shall be multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is 10. 
(9)  Any portion of a member's benefit that is attributable to mandatory member contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the Code. 
(10)  Should any member participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the member's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the member's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the member's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(11)  For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this Section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to Section 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to Section 1.415(b) 1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(12)  The determination of the annual pension under paragraph (A)(1) of this subsection (a) shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the Code) social security supplements described in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant Section 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(13)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of the Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (a) and the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (a) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(14)  For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, Compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the member and which is not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 125 or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this subsection (a), compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years on or after July 1, 2007, compensation shall include payments that otherwise qualify as compensation and that are made by the later of: (a) two and one-half (21/2) months after severance from employment with the employer, and (b) the end of the limitation year that includes the date of severance. 
(b)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
 April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of seventy and one-half (701/2) years; or 
 April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(c)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in subsection (b) of this section 2-163.36A. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
(A)  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(i)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later. 
(ii)  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(iii)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(B)  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
(i)  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subparagraph (2)(A) above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(I)  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
(II)  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(ii)  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(C)  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs (2)(A) and 2(B) above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
(A)  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
(B)  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age seventy (70) under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of seventy (70) over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph (3)(B), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs (4)(A), (4)(B) and (4)(C) below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(A)  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
(ii)  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs (2) or (3) above, whichever is applicable, of this subsection (c); 
(iii)  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
(iv)  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(I)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(II)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code; 
(III)  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
(IV)  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
(B)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subparagraph (2)(A)(i) or (2)(A)(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
(C)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  [Beginning date.] For purposes of this subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph (2)(A) above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
(A)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the Treasury regulations. 
(B)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (c). 
(C)  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(d)  (1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section: 
(A)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
(i)  Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; 
(ii)  Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; 
(iii)  The portion of any distribution which is made upon hardship of the member; and 
(iv)  The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
(3)  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust described in Section 401 (a) of the Code, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of Code Section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
(4)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code or an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code shall be considered a distributee. 
(5)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  [Maximum mandatory distribution.] Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, payable under the plan shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
(f)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17). In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding twelve (12) months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). 
    Any reference in the plan to the limitation under Section 401 (a)(17) of the Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(g)  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

    The right of an individual to a pension, to the return of accumulated member contributions, the pension itself, any optional benefit, any other right accrued or accruing to any individual under the provisions of the retirement system, and any moneys belonging to the retirement system, shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any other process of law whatsoever, and shall be un-assignable, except as is otherwise specifically provided herein; except the recipient of any monthly benefit may authorize the board of trustees to withhold from the monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. The board of trustees may, upon the written request of the retiree of the pension plan, authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for premiums for accident, health, and long-term care insurance for the retiree and the retiree's spouse and dependents. The pension plan, and its board of trustees, shall not incur any liability for participation in this permissive program should its actions be taken in good faith.

(b)  A member shall execute a subrogation agreement on a form provided by the retirement system or such other documents which may be necessary to document the retirement system's subrogation rights. The member shall notify the retirement system of any claim or legal action asserted against any party or insurance carrier for such injuries and shall notify the retirement system of the name and address of such party and any insurance carrier. The member shall take no action inconsistent with the requirements of this section, nor settle any claim without obtaining the prior consent of the retirement system. 
(c)  The retirement system's subrogation rights shall not be subject to equitable distribution or to any reduction for costs or attorneys' fees incurred by the member in pursuit of his or her claim against a third-party tortfeasor or any insurance carrier. Further, the retirement system's subrogation rights shall not be subject to reduction regardless of whether the member recovers the full value of his or her claim against a third-party and/or any insurance carrier. 
(d)  In the event that the member fails to execute a subrogation agreement, or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this section, then such shall be considered a breach of this retirement system and disability pension benefits may be denied and/or discontinued by the board of trustees upon a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis.

The recovery of overpayments may be accomplished by reducing the amount of future payments so that the actuarial present value of actual payments to the recipient is equal to the actuarial present value of the payments to which the recipient was correctly entitled. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7782, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-163.40. - Liability. 
    Payments made by the retirement system to a retirant or beneficiary shall operate as a full discharge, release, and acquittance of the liability of the city and the retirement system and there shall be no obligation on the part of the city or the retirement system to assure that such payments are actually used and applied for the benefit of the retirant or beneficiary. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7782, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-163.41. - Qualified retirement system. 
    The city intends the retirement system to be a qualified pension plan under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or successor provisions of law and that the trust be an exempt organization in compliance with Section 501 of said Code.

Sec. 2-164.2. - Definitions. 
    As used in this division: 
    Accumulated member contributions means the sum of all amounts credited to a member's individual account in the reserve for member contributions. 
    Beneficiary means an individual who is being paid or who has entitlement to the future payment of a pension on account of a reason other than the individual's membership in the retirement system. 
    City means the City of Jacksonville Beach, Florida. 
    Compensation means the salary or wages paid a member for personal services rendered the city while a member of the retirement system. Salary and wages shall include longevity pay; overtime pay, shift differentials; incentive pay, pay for periods of absence from work by reason of vacation, holiday, and sickness; and deferred compensation amounts under deferred compensation programs recognized by the board of trustees. Compensation shall not include any remuneration or reimbursement not specifically stated to be included, such as allowances for clothing, equipment, cleaning, and travel; reimbursement of expenses; bonuses; termination of pay; severance pay; payments in consideration of unused vacation or sick leave; and the value of fringe benefits. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, a member's annual compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be disregarded. However, for those members who commence participation in the retirement system prior to the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995, the limitation on compensation shall not be less than the amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the retirement system as in effect on July 1, 1993.

Provided that a member may voluntarily leave his or her contributions in the fund for a period of not more than five (5) years after leaving employment of the city, pending the possibility of being rehired by the city as a firefighter, without losing credit for the time he or she had participated as a member of the fund. 
(c)  A former member with forfeited credited service who wishes to return to city employment as a firefighter, must restore the forfeited credited service to receive credit for prior service within ninety (90) days after return to city employment.

Such individuals shall retain their accrued benefits based on credited service earned prior to July 21, 2014. 
(3)  Effective July 21, 2014, the maximum benefit shall be ninety (90) percent of final average compensation or ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00) annually, whichever is less; provided, any individual who has accrued a benefit percentage in excess of ninety (90) percent or an annual benefit of more than ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00) on July 21, 2014, shall retain that accrued benefit, but shall not accrue any additional benefit percentage after that date. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the above, there shall be a minimum monthly benefit provided to retirants who have been retired for thirty (30) or more years or have accumulated ten (10) or more years of credited service, as periodically established by the city.

(c)  Payment of a pension granted under the provisions of section 2-164.7 with respect to normal retirement shall be suspended if the retirant becomes employed by the city. Suspension of payment shall become effective the first day of the calendar month coincident with or next following employment.

Sec. 2-164.10. - Forms of payment of a pension. 
    A member or a vested member may elect to have pension payments made under any one of the following forms of payment and name a survivor beneficiary. The election and naming of a survivor beneficiary shall be in writing and filed with the retirement system prior to the date the first pension payment is made. An election of form of payment may not be changed on or after the date the first pension payment is made. A named survivor beneficiary may be changed on or after the date the first pension payment is made up to two (2) times as provided in § 175.333, Florida Statutes, without the approval of the board of trustees or the current survivor beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good health of the survivor beneficiary being removed, and the joint annuitant or beneficiary being removed need not be living. After any such change in joint survivor or beneficiary, the member's pension benefit will be recalculated accordingly by the actuary and their retirement income shall be payable to the member based on the new calculation. If the member chooses not to provide proof of good health of the survivor beneficiary being removed, the actuarial calculation will assume the retiree and new survivor beneficiary are five (5) years older than their actual age. A named survivor beneficiary may be more than one person if form of payment I is elected. Payment shall be made under Form of Payment I if there is not a timely election of form of payment. The amount of pension under forms of payment I, II, and III, shall have the same actuarial present value, computed as of the date of retirement, as the amount of pension under Form of Payment I. 
(1)  Form of Payment I (Life with Period Certain Guarantee )-Under Form of Payment I, the retirant is paid a pension for life. Upon the death of the retirant during the guaranteed period, the named survivor beneficiary is paid the full amount of the form of Payment I pension for remainder of the guaranteed period. The guaranteed period is one hundred twenty (120) months. The actuarial present value of remaining guaranteed pension payments shall be paid to the legal representative of the retirant or the named survivor beneficiary, whichever survives the longest, if both the retirant and named survivor beneficiary die during the guaranteed period. 
(2)  Form of Payment II (Life with Full Continuation to Survivor Beneficiary). Under Form of Payment II, the retirant is paid a reduced pension until the retirant dies. Upon death of the retirant during the lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor beneficiary is paid the full amount of the reduced Form of Payment II pension over the named survivor beneficiary's remaining life. 
(3)  Form of Payment III (Life with reduced Continuation to Survivor Beneficiary) -Under Form of Payment III, the retirant is paid a reduced pension until the retirant dies. Upon the death of the retirant during the lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor beneficiary is paid one-half (1/2), two-thirds ( 2/3 ) or three-fourths (3/4) of the amount of the reduced Form of Payment III pension over the named survivor beneficiary's remaining life. 
(4)  Form of Payment IV (Straight Life or Lifetime Annuity). A retirement income of larger monthly amount, payable to the retirant for his or her lifetime only. 
(5)  Pop-up on election of Form of Payment II or Form of Payment III. All members who enter the DROP or retire on or after October 1, 2009, shall have an automatic pop-up provision configured into their form of payment election. If a member of the DROP or retirant has elected either Form of Payment II or Form of Payment III, and the designated survivor pre-deceases them after benefit payments have commenced, then the retirant's benefit shall be recalculated and automatically revert to the Form of Payment SL as of the date of death of the named survivor beneficiary. Election of a joint and last survivor option and its accompanying pop-up protection shall be the actuarial equivalent of the Form of Payment SL. 
(6)  DROP participant pop-up. Effective October 1, 2009, benefit calculations for current DROP participants that elected Form of Payment II or Form of Payment III shall be recalculated retroactively to the member's DROP entry date to include the automatic pop-up provided for herein. All costs associated with such recalculation, including interest as determined by the board, shall be borne by the DROP participant and automatically deducted from their DROP account balance as of October 1, 2009. DROP participants that elected Form of Payment II or Form of Payment III shall have the option of retaining their original benefit calculation without the pop-up by notifying the pension board of trustees in writing within sixty (60) days of the enactment of this provision.

Sec. 2-164.36A. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(a)  Maximum amount of retirement income. 
(1)  The limitations of this subsection (a) shall apply in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein, and are intended to comply with the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and shall be construed in accordance with said Act and guidance issued thereunder. The provisions of this subsection (a) shall supersede any provision of the plan to the extent such provision is inconsistent with this subsection. 
The annual pension as defined in paragraph (2) below otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the dollar limitation for the member multiplied by a fraction whose value cannot exceed one, the numerator of which is the member's number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of service with the city and the denominator of which is 10. For this purpose, no more than one year of service may be credited for any plan year. If the benefit the member would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(2)  "Annual pension" means the sum of all annual benefits, payable in the form of a straight life annuity. Benefits payable in any other form shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
(A)  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. 
(I)  the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit, or 
(II)  the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
(B)  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. 
(I)  the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan for the particular form of payment, or 
(II)  the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to § 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this subsection (a), and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any Limitation Year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
(3)  "Dollar limitation" means, effective for the first limitation year beginning after January 1, 2001, one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00), automatically adjusted under Code Section 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new limitation shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a member's benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year. The dollar limitation shall be further adjusted based on the age of the member when the benefit begins as follows: 
(A)  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007. 
(I)  If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age sixty-five (65): 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)(A)(I)(i) of this subsection (a). For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-five (65) is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical member who is age sixty-five (65) and has the same accrued benefit as the member. 
(II)  Except with respect to a member who is a "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code), if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is before age sixty-two (62). 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5.00%) interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement. 
The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age sixty-two (62), both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)(A)(II)(i) of this subsection (a). 
(B)  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007. 
Age as of Annuity Starting Date: Adjustment of Dollar Limitation: Over 65 The smaller of: 
(a) the actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) the actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using a 5.00% interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). Any increase in the dollar limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph shall not reflect a mortality decrement between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 62 to 65 No adjustment. Less than 62 The smaller of: 
(a) the actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan, or (b) the actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using a 5.00% interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). This adjustment shall not apply to any "Qualified Member" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H), nor to survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code.  
(4)  With respect to clause (3)(A)(I)(i), clause (3)(A)(II)(i) and paragraph (3)(B) above, no adjustment shall be made to the dollar limitation to reflect the probability of a member's death between the annuity starting date and age sixty-two (62), or between age sixty-five (65) and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the members death if the plan does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in Code Section 417(c), upon the member's death. 
(5)  The term "limitation year" is the 12-month period, which is used for application of the limitations under Code Section 415 and shall be the calendar year. 
(6)  The limitations set forth in this subsection (a) shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) provided the member has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(7)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section Subsection 415(d) of the Code. 
(8)  In the case of a member who has fewer than ten (10) years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection (a) shall be multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is 10. 
(9)  Any portion of a member's benefit that is attributable to mandatory member contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the Code. 
(10)  Should any member participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the member's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the member's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the member's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(11)  For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to Section 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to Section 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(12)  The determination of the annual pension under paragraph (A)(1) of this subsection (a) shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the Code) social security supplements described in Section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant Section 1.411 (d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(13)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of the Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (a) and the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (a) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(14)  For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, Compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the member and which is not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 125 or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this subsection (a), compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years on or after July 1, 2007, compensation shall include payments that otherwise qualify as compensation and that are made by the later of: (a) two and one-half (21/2) months after severance from employment with the employer, and (b) the end of the limitation year that includes the date of severance. 
(b)  Required beginning date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
 April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of seventy and one-half (701/2) years; or 
 April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(c)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in subsection (b) of this section 2-164.36A. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
(A)  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(i)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later. 
(ii)  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(iii)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(B)  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
(i)  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subparagraph (2)(A) above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(I)  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
(II)  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(ii)  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
(C)  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, subparagraphs (2)(A) and 2(B) above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
(A)  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant, a nonspousal beneficiary, and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
(B)  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age seventy (70) under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of seventy (70) over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph (3)(B), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs (4)(A), (4)(B) and (4)(C) below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(A)  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
(ii)  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs (2) or (3) above, whichever is applicable, of this subsection (c); 
(iii)  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
(iv)  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(I)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(II)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code; 
(III)  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
(IV)  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
(B)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subparagraph (2)(A)(i) or (2)(A)(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
(C)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  [Beginning date.] For purposes of this subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph (2)(A) above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
(A)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the Treasury regulations. 
(B)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (c). 
(C)  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(d)  (1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section: 
(A)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
(i)  Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; 
(ii)  Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; 
(iii)  The portion of any distribution which is made upon hardship of the member; and 
(iv)  The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
(3)  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust described in Section 401 (a) of the Code, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of Code Section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
(4)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributee's with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code or an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code shall be considered a distributee. 
(5)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  [Maximum mandatory distribution.] Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, payable under the plan shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). 
(f)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17). In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding twelve (12) months, over which Compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12). 
    Any reference in the plan to the limitation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(g)  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Sec. 2-164.37. - Assignments prohibited. 
    The right of an individual to a pension, to the return of accumulated member contributions, the pension itself, any optional benefit, any other right accrued or accruing to any individual under the provisions of the retirement system, and any moneys belonging to the retirement system, shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any other process of law whatsoever, and shall be un-assignable, except as is otherwise specifically provided herein; except the recipient of any monthly benefit may authorize the board of trustees to withhold from the monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. The board of trustees may, upon the written request of the retiree of the pension plan, authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for premiums for accident, health, and long-term care insurance for the retiree and the retiree's spouse and dependents. The pension plan, and its board of trustees, shall not incur any liability for participation in this permissive program should its actions be taken in good faith. The city shall have the right to setoff for any claim arising from embezzlement by a fraud of a member, retirant, or beneficiary as provided in F.S. § 175.195.

Sec. 2-164.38. - Subrogation.

(b)  A member shall execute a subrogation agreement on a form provided by the retirement system or such other documents, which may be necessary to document the retirement system's subrogation rights. The member shall notify the retirement system of any claim or legal action asserted against any party or insurance carrier for such injuries and shall notify the retirement system of the name and address of such party and any insurance carrier. The member shall take no action inconsistent with the requirements of this section, nor settle any claim without obtaining the prior consent of the retirement system. 
(c)  The retirement system's subrogation rights shall not be subject to equitable distribution or to any reduction for costs or attorneys' fees incurred by the member in pursuit of his or her claim against a third-party tortfeasor or any insurance carrier. Further, the retirement system's subrogation rights shall not be subject to reduction regardless of whether the member recovers the full value of his or her claim against a third-party and/or any insurance carrier. 
(d)  In the event that the member fails to execute a subrogation agreement, or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this section, then such shall be considered a breach of this retirement system and disability pension benefits may be denied and/or discontinued by the board of trustees upon a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7783, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-164.39. - Correction of errors. 
    The retirement system shall correct errors in the records of the retirement system. The retirement system shall seek to recover any overpayments, and shall make up any underpayments, which have been made. The recovery of overpayments may be accomplished by reducing the amount of future payments so that the actuarial present value of actual payments to the recipient is equal to the actuarial present value of the payments to which the recipient was correctly entitled. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7783, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-164.40. - Liability. 
    Payments made by the retirement system to a retirant or beneficiary shall operate as a full discharge, release, and acquittance of the liability of the city and the retirement system and there shall be no obligation on the part of the city or the retirement system to assure that such payments are actually used and applied for the benefit of the retirant or beneficiary. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7783, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-164.41. - Qualified retirement system. 
    The city intends the retirement system to be a qualified pension plan under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or successor provisions of law and that the trust be an exempt organization in compliance with Section 501 of said code. The board of trustees may adopt such additional provisions to the retirement system as are necessary to fulfill the intent of being a qualified pension plan. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7783, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-164.42. - Severability. 
    If any provision of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are declared severable. 
(Ord. No. 2000-7783, § 1, 2-7-00) 
Sec. 2-164.43. - Merger and termination. 
(a)  Merger. This retirement system shall not merge or consolidate with any other retirement system or pension plan, nor transfer any assets or liabilities to any other retirement system or pension plan, unless each member and beneficiary of the retirement system will receive a benefit immediately after such merger, consolidation, or transfer which is at least equal to the benefit the member or beneficiary was entitled to immediately before such merger, consolidation, or transfer. 
(b)  Termination. In the event of termination of the retirement system, the board of trustees shall follow the procedures contained in Florida Statutes § 175.361, and the Internal Revenue Code.

(d)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the property owner and/or violator, and may immediately notify the special magistrate and request a hearing. 
(e)  If the owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before an enforcement board, special magistrate, or court transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code inspector of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five (5) days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period to correct the violation before the hearing is held.

    In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the following factors:

(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and, 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(c)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records, and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator.

The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

An appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the execution of the order to be appealed.

As a condition of the continuation of the privilege, alcoholic beverage establishments are required to take all necessary steps to minimize illegal activities. 
(1)  Illegal activities included. The following are representative, but not all-inclusive, of activities that may result in suspension of the privilege of extended hours of operation for authorized alcoholic beverage establishments to sell alcoholic beverages for purposes of consumption on the premises: 
a.  Illegal activities requiring a police response that occur on or adjacent to the premises of an alcoholic beverage establishment. Particular emphasis will be given to illegal activities of the owner, employees, patrons of the establishment, or others associated with the establishment; including, but not limited to, the use, sale, or delivery of controlled substances, allowing underage drinking, continuing to sell alcoholic beverages after closing time, violation of open container laws, serving alcoholic beverages to intoxicated persons, disturbances, batteries, driving under the influence (DUI), disorderly intoxication, violations of the Florida Fire Prevention Code, and other violations of law during all hours of operation. The city shall consider whether the need for police services is the result of the establishment's failure or inability to maintain proper order and control during all hours of operation; 
b.  Failure of any restaurant, as defined in section 4-2(b)(7), which possesses a 4-COP-SRX (Special Restaurant) state alcoholic beverage license as addressed under the provisions of F.S. § 561.20(2)(a)4;

5.  To derive at least fifty-one (51%) percent of its gross revenue from the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages. Failure to derive at least fifty-one (51%) percent of its gross revenue from the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages shall be based on the findings of an audit of the 4-COP-SRX licensee by the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, irrespective of any sanctions or penalties imposed by said division pursuant to that audit. 
c.  Complaints verified and documented by police arising from adverse effects of extended hours of operation upon neighboring properties, including, but not limited to, excessive noise, illegal parking, vandalism, generation of trash or garbage on or adjacent to the establishment, loitering by intoxicated persons, or exterior lighting on neighboring residential properties;

g.  Sales by employees during prohibited hours. No person, or any agent, servant, or employee of any person licensed under the state alcoholic beverage laws shall sell, or offer for sale, any beer, wine, liquor, or alcoholic beverage of any kind during prohibited hours.

(2)  Successive violations. In order to invoke the enforcement provisions of this section, a violation must be traceable to the particular alcoholic beverage establishment against which action is taken, and must be verified and documented by a police officer, code enforcement officer, or fire department official. 
a.  1st notice of violation. Except as provided, a first violation by an alcoholic beverage establishment of any section of the Code of Ordinances or state statutes shall result in a written notice of violation that will not require an appearance before the special magistrate. Issuance of a written 1st notice of violation for a violation of this section shall not prevent the filing of charges against the alcoholic beverage establishment or any person with any other violation of the Code of Ordinances or state statutes. The 1st notice of violation shall be issued by a police officer. The 1st notice of violation shall be left with the owner, proprietor, manager, or highest-ranking employee then on the premises of the alcoholic beverage establishment. Issuance of a 1st notice of violation for a violation of this section shall not prevent the filing of charges against the alcoholic beverage establishment or any person with any other violation of the Code of Ordinances or state statutes. If the first violation is the result of a felony criminal offense being committed on the premises, or the incident resulting in a felony criminal offense being committed began on the premises of the establishment, the first violation may be presented to the special magistrate for consideration of the suspension of the extended hours permit. 
b.  2nd notice of violation. A subsequent violation of any section of the Code of Ordinances or state statutes by an alcoholic beverage establishment within one hundred eighty (180) days of issuance of a written 1st notice of violation shall result in a 2nd notice of violation. The 2nd notice of violation shall be issued by a police officer. The 2nd notice of violation shall be left with the owner, proprietor, manager, or highest-ranking employee then on the premises of the alcoholic beverage establishment. Issuance of a 2nd notice of violation for a violation of this section shall not prevent the filing of charges against the alcoholic beverage establishment or any person with any other violation of the Code of Ordinances or state statutes. 
c.  Special magistrate. A 2nd notice of violation shall be taken before the city's special magistrate for consideration of suspension of the alcoholic beverage establishment's extended hours of operation permit. The special magistrate shall exercise jurisdiction over such matters as set forth in Article VI, section 2-170 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Jacksonville Beach. 
d.  Action by the special magistrate. Upon completion of the hearing, the special magistrate shall deliver a ruling either that no action shall be taken against the alcoholic beverage establishment's extended hours of operation permit, or that the extended hours of operation permit shall be suspended. A suspension of the extended hours of operation permit for a first finding by the special magistrate of a violation shall be not less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days. A second and any subsequent finding by the special magistrate of a violation of the extended hours of operation permit within one year (365 days) of the date of completion of the most recent suspension period shall result in a suspension of not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred eighty (180) days. In addition to any suspension of the extended hours of operation permit, the special magistrate may issue a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation of this section. The special magistrate shall base his/her ruling upon substantial, competent evidence presented that supports a finding of non-compliance with this section. The special magistrate's written order of suspension of the extended hours of operation permit shall state the effective date of suspension and shall give the alcoholic beverage establishment at least ten calendar days notice of the suspension. 
e.  Failure of alleged violator to appear. If an alcoholic beverage establishment served with a notice of violation fails to appear at the hearing after having received proper notice, the special magistrate shall take testimony from city staff, and other relevant testimony, as available, and shall deliver a ruling either that no action shall be taken against the alcoholic beverage establishment's extended hours of operation permit, or that the extended hours of operation permit shall be suspended for a period of time as set forth in section 4-2(e)(2)d. of this section. A ruling that the extended hours of operation be suspended shall take effect on the eleventh calendar day after the ordered is issued and provided to the alcoholic beverage establishment. The enforcement of such order shall be stayed if the alcoholic beverage establishment files a request for a rehearing with the city clerk's office before the date the order is scheduled to take effect. In such case, the alcoholic beverage establishment shall be rescheduled for a hearing before the special magistrate. At that hearing, the special magistrate shall take testimony from the alcoholic beverage establishment, and other relevant testimony, as available, and shall deliver a ruling upholding the previous order suspending the extended hours of operation permit, amending the order suspending the extended hours of operation permit, or rescinding the order suspending the extended hours of operation permit. If the special magistrate upholds a suspension of the extended hours of operation permit, such suspension shall take effect the next calendar day after the ruling is issued. 
f.  [Suspension.] Any alcoholic beverage establishment that has had an extended hours of operation permit suspended cannot avoid the consequences of the special magistrate's action by changing its business name or corporate status, as set forth in F.S. § 561.32. 
g.  [Enforcement procedures.] The enforcement procedures contained herein are alternative procedures, and the city reserves the right to arrest, prosecute, or take action utilizing alternative procedures authorized by law.

Sec. 5-24. - Dangerous dogs. 
(a)  Procedures for designating a dog as dangerous and actions following a designation are: 
(1)  The animal control officer shall investigate reported incidents involving any dog that may be dangerous and shall, if possible, interview the owner and require a sworn affidavit from any person desiring to have a dog classified as dangerous. Any animal that is the subject of a dangerous dog investigation shall be impounded by the animal control officer if the animal control officer believes such impoundment is in the best interests of public safety due to the severity or number of attacks. If the dog has bitten a human being or domestic animal causing a break in the skin, or has in any manner appeared to have transferred bodily fluids such as saliva to the skin of a human being, or the skin or hair of a domestic animal, as determined by the animal control officer, the dog shall be impounded and placed in quarantine for the proper length of time. The owner shall be responsible for payment to the City of Jacksonville Beach of all boarding costs and other fees as may be required to keep the animal in a safe and humane manner pending expiration of any quarantine period and/or the outcome of the investigation and resolution of any hearings related to the dangerous dog classification, unless the animal is ultimately determined not to be a dangerous dog. Any animal that is the subject of a dangerous dog investigation that is not impounded by the animal control officer shall be humanely, safely, and securely confined by the owner indoors or in a securely fenced or enclosed area pending the outcome of the investigation and resolution of any hearings related to the dangerous dog classification. The address of where the animal resides shall be provided to the animal control officer. No dog that is the subject of a dangerous dog investigation may be relocated or ownership transferred pending the outcome of an investigation or any hearings related to the determination of a dangerous dog classification. In the event that a dog is to be destroyed, the dog shall not be relocated or ownership transferred. 
(2)  A dog shall not be declared dangerous if the threat, injury, or damage was sustained by a person who, at the time, was unlawfully on the property or, while lawfully on the property, was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog or its owner or a family member. No dog may be declared dangerous if the dog was protecting or defending a human being within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault. 
(3)  If the investigation by an animal control officer finds sufficient cause to classify a dog as dangerous, the animal control officer shall forward a report to the special magistrate with a recommendation that the dog be designated a dangerous dog. The special magistrate shall provide written notification of the sufficient cause finding to the owner by registered mail, certified hand delivery, or service in conformance with the provisions of Chapter 48 of the Florida Statutes relating to service of process. The owner may file a written request for a hearing within seven (7) calendar days from the date of receipt of the notification of the sufficient cause finding and, if requested, the hearing shall be held as soon as possible, but not more than thirty (30) calendar days and no sooner than five (5) calendar days after receipt of the request from the owner. In rendering its decision, the special magistrate may consider information and/or documentation including, but not necessarily limited to, written or verbal reports and/or statements, medical reports, if available, photographs, and/or other facts or details that the special magistrate, in its sole discretion, determines will assist in its decision. If the owner fails to request a hearing, or fails to appear for the hearing after requesting it, the special magistrate shall render a decision based upon information and/or documentation provided by the animal control officer and any victim(s) or witness(es). The owner may provide a written statement to the special magistrate in lieu of attending the hearing. The special magistrate shall render a decision within fourteen (14) calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing. 
(4)  If a dog is classified as a dangerous dog by the special magistrate, the special magistrate shall provide written notification to the owner by registered mail, certified hand delivery or service, within seven (7) calendar days after a decision is rendered. The owner may file a written request for a hearing in the county court to appeal the classification within ten (10) business days after receipt of a written determination of a dangerous dog classification and, if not impounded, must securely confine the animal indoors or in a securely fenced or enclosed area pending a resolution of the appeal. 
(b)  Within fourteen (14) calendar days after a dog has been classified as dangerous by the special magistrate, or a dangerous dog classification is upheld by the county court on appeal, the owner of the dog must obtain a certificate of registration for the dog from the City of Jacksonville Beach, and the certificate shall be renewed annually. The City of Jacksonville Beach shall issue such certificates of registration, and renewals thereof, only to persons who are at least eighteen (18) years of age and who present to the City of Jacksonville Beach sufficient evidence of: 
(1)  A current certificate of rabies vaccination for the dog;

Pending any hearing before the special magistrate, the owner shall be responsible for payment to the City of Jacksonville Beach of all boarding costs and other fees as may be required to keep the impounded animal humanely and safely. If the owner of the dangerous dog at large fails to appear for the hearing, the special magistrate shall render a decision based upon information and/or documentation provided by the animal control officer and any witness(es). The owner may provide a written statement to the special magistrate in lieu of attending the hearing. The special magistrate shall render a decision within seven (7) calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing and issue a finding upholding or rejecting the complaint of a dangerous dog at large. If the special magistrate issues a finding upholding the dangerous dog at large complaint, the owner shall be guilty of a non-criminal offense, punishable as provided in section 5-24.2 of this article. If a dog that has previously been declared dangerous and has previously been declared by the special magistrate to be a dangerous dog at large becomes loose or unconfined a second time, either off the owner's property or outside a securely fenced or enclosed area on the owner's property, the animal control officer shall attempt to locate and, if found, immediately impound the dog, and document the circumstances in a report to the special magistrate. The special magistrate shall conduct a hearing on a second complaint of a dangerous dog at large following notification procedures as set forth in section 5-24(a)(3) of this article. Pending any hearing before the special magistrate, the owner shall be responsible for payment to the City of Jacksonville Beach of all boarding costs and other fees as may be required to keep the impounded animal humanely and safely. If the owner of the dangerous dog at large fails to appear for the hearing, the special magistrate shall render a decision based upon information and/or documentation provided by the animal control officer and any witness(es). The owner may provide a written statement to the special magistrate in lieu of attending the hearing. The special magistrate shall render a decision within seven (7) calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing and issue a finding upholding or rejecting the complaint of a dangerous dog at large. If the special magistrate issues a finding upholding the dangerous dog at large complaint for the second time, the dog shall be held for ten (10) business days after the owner is given written notification as provided in section 5-24(a)(4) of this article, and thereafter destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner. This ten day time period shall allow the owner to request a hearing in the county court as provided in section 5-24(a)(4). The owner shall be responsible for payment of all boarding costs and other fees as may be required to keep the animal humanely and safely during any appeal procedure. 
(e)  The owner shall immediately notify the animal control officer or the Jacksonville Beach Police Department when a dog that has been classified as dangerous: 
(1)  Has bitten a human being or attacked another animal; 
(2)  Is sold, given away, or dies; or 
(3)  Is moved to another address. 
Prior to a dangerous dog being sold or given away, the owner shall provide the name, address, and telephone number of the new owner to the animal control officer. The new owner must comply with all of the requirements of applicable Florida Statutes and this article, even if the animal is moved from one local jurisdiction to another within the state. 
(f)  The animal control officer or the Jacksonville Beach Police Department must be notified by the owner of a dog classified as dangerous under another jurisdiction's ordinances, or under provisions of Florida Statutes 767.11, 767.12, or 767.13, that the dog has been brought into the City of Jacksonville Beach. The owner, whether bringing said dangerous dog into the City of Jacksonville Beach temporarily, or for purposes of establishing residency within the city, shall comply with the provisions of this article. 
(g)  It is unlawful for the owner of a dangerous dog to permit the dog to be outside a proper enclosure, or off the owner's property on either public property or private property of another, or while being transported in a vehicle, unless the dog is muzzled and restrained by a substantial chain or leash and under control of a competent person. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration but will prevent it from biting any person or animal. The owner may exercise the dog in a securely fenced or enclosed area that does not have a top, without a muzzle or leash, if the dog remains within his or her sight, and only members of the immediate household or persons eighteen (18) years of age or older are allowed in the enclosure when the dog is present. When being transported, such dogs must be safely and securely restrained within a vehicle. 
(h)  An animal control officer shall immediately impound a dangerous dog if the owner fails to comply within the timeframes set forth in this article with any of the requirements for maintaining a dangerous dog. A dangerous dog impounded under this section may be redeemed by the owner upon the owner's compliance with all applicable provisions of this article and upon payment of impound fees, boarding fees, and applicable veterinary or other medical expenses. If the owner fails to comply with all applicable provisions and redeem the dangerous dog within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date the dog was impounded, the dog shall be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner. 
(i)  This section does not apply to dogs used by law enforcement officials for law enforcement work.

ARTICLE II. - MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LOANS 

Sec. 15-31. - Definitions. 
(a)  Title loan agreement means a written agreement whereby a secondhand dealer agrees to make a loan of a specific sum of money to the owner of a motor vehicle, and the owner of the motor vehicle agrees to give the secondhand dealer a security interest in a motor vehicle certificate of title owned by the borrower and encumbered only by a title loan agreement. 
(b)  Secondhand dealer has the same meaning as used in F.S. § 538.03(1)(a), as it may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 2011-8000, § 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 15-32. - Motor vehicle title loan transactions. 
    A secondhand dealer registered under F.S. Ch. 538, Part I, may engage in motor vehicle title loan transactions, as that term is used in F.S. Ch. 538, Part I, if the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The secondhand dealer maintains physical possession of the motor vehicle certificate of title; and 
(2)  The borrower maintains possession of, or control over, the motor vehicle throughout the term of the loan; and 
(3)  The borrower is not required to pay rent or any other charge for the use of the motor vehicle; and 
(4)  The secondhand dealer delivers to the borrower, at the time a loan is made, a statement showing the loan amount, origination date, maturity date, finance charges, a description of the security, the name and address of the borrower and the secondhand dealer, the rate of interest expressed in terms of annual percentage rate, the total number of payments required, and the total amount required to be paid over the life of the loan. In the event the borrower has a right to renew the loan, the secondhand dealer must deliver a statement with the information required herein for each renewal; and 
(5)  The title loan agreement contains the following statement printed in not less than ten-point type: 
a.  Your vehicle has been pledged as security for this loan and if you do not repay this loan in full, including the finance charge, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR VEHICLE. 
b.  You are encouraged to repay this loan at the end of the thirty-day period. The lender is not required to extend or renew your loan. It is important that you plan your finances so that you can repay this loan as soon as possible. 
c.  This loan has a very high interest rate. Do not complete this loan transaction if you have the ability to borrow from another source at a rate lower than an annual percentage rate of thirty (30) percent. 
d.  The borrower represents and warrants that the motor vehicle and the certificate of title is not stolen, it has no liens or encumbrances against it, the borrower has the right to enter into this transaction, and the borrower will not attempt to sell the motor vehicle or apply for a duplicate certificate of title while the title loan agreement is in effect, and that doing so will be a violation of law. 
e.  Immediately above the signature of the borrower the statement that "I, the borrower declare that the information I have provided is true and correct and I have read and understand the foregoing document." 
f.  A blank line for the signature of the borrower. 
(6)  The secondhand dealer must display, in a prominent place in the title loan premises, for customer viewing, a sign no smaller than three (3) feet by five (5) feet with the following message written in letters no less than two (2) inches high: 
IF YOU RECEIVE A TITLE LOAN, YOUR VEHICLE WILL BE PLEDGED AS SECURITY FOR THE LOAN. IF YOU DO NOT REPAY THIS LOAN IN FULL, INCLUDING ALL FINANCE CHARGES, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR VEHICLE. THIS LOAN HAS A VERY HIGH INTEREST RATE. DO NOT COMPLETE A TITLE LOAN TRANSACTION IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AT A RATE LOWER THAN AN ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OF 30%. 
(Ord. No. 2011-8000, § 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 15-33. - Maximum interest rate. 
    A secondhand dealer who engages in title loan transactions may not exceed the following interest rates: 
(1)  A secondhand dealer may charge an interest rate not to exceed thirty (30) percent per annum. In determining compliance with the maximum interest and finance charges, the computation must be simple interest and not add-on interest or any other interest computation. 
(2)  The annual percentage rate that may be charged in a motor vehicle title loan may equal, but not exceed, the annual percentage rate that must be computed and disclosed as required by the Federal Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. When the period for which the charge is computed is more or less than one month, the maximum rate for the period must be computed on a basis of one-thirtieth ( 1/30 ) the applicable monthly interest rate, multiplied by the number of days of the period. 
(3)  Any transaction involving a borrower's delivery of a motor vehicle certificate of title in exchange for the advancement of funds on the condition that the borrower shall or may redeem or repurchase the certificate of title upon the payment of a sum of money, whether the transaction be characterized as a "buy-sell agreement," "sale-leaseback agreement," or otherwise, shall be deemed a violation of this article if such sum exceeds the amount that a secondhand dealer may collect in a title loan agreement under this article or if the terms of the transaction otherwise conflict with the permitted terms and conditions of a title loan agreement under this article. 
(4)  Any fees or taxes paid to a state agency and directly related to an individual title loan transaction may be collected from the borrower and shall be in addition to the permitted finance and interest charge. 
(5)  No charges, including interest, in excess of the combined total of all charges permitted by this section shall be allowed. 
(Ord. No. 2011-8000, § 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 15-34. - Transaction satisfaction and default. 
(a)  When the title loan has been paid in full, the secondhand dealer must deliver to the borrower a certificate of title clear of all encumbrances placed upon the title by the secondhand dealer within thirty (30) days of such payment in full. 
(b)  A secondhand dealer who engages in title loan transactions may take possession of the motor vehicle upon the borrower's default under the title loan agreement. Unless the borrower voluntarily surrenders the motor vehicle, the secondhand dealer may only take possession of a motor vehicle through an agent licensed by the State of Florida to repossess motor vehicles. 
(c)  A secondhand dealer who takes possession of a motor vehicle pursuant to this section shall comply with the applicable requirements of F.S. Ch. 679, Part V. 
(d)  Disposition of the collateral or motor vehicle may be by public or private proceedings and may be made by way of one or more contracts. Sale or other disposition may be as a unit or in parts and at any time and place and on any terms, but every aspect of the disposition including the method, manner, time, place and terms, including surplus of the debt must be commercially reasonable. 
(Ord. No. 2011-8000, § 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 15-35. - Local business tax receipt. 
(a)  No secondhand dealer may engage in business as a title loan lender six (6) months after the effective date of this article unless the secondhand dealer has a valid local business tax receipt issued by the city. A separate business tax receipt will be required for each physical location of title loan business. The city clerk shall issue more than one business tax receipt to an applicant if that applicant complies with the requirements of this part for each business tax receipt. 
(b)  An application for a local business tax receipt pursuant to this part must be submitted to the city clerk on such form as the city clerk may prescribe. If the city clerk determines that an application should be granted, the city clerk shall issue the local business tax receipt for a period not to exceed two (2) years. A non-refundable application and business tax not exceeding one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($1,250.00) shall accompany an initial application for each title loan application. 
(c)  The city clerk shall charge a biennial renewal tax of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). A business tax that is not renewed at the end of each two-year period shall automatically become inactive. An inactive business tax receipt may be reactivated within ninety (90) days after the date it became inactive upon the submission of a completed reactivation form and payment of a reactivation tax not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00) and a biennial business tax of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). No inactive business may be reactivated after ninety (90) days. 
(d)  Each business tax receipt must specify the location for which it is issued and must be conspicuously displayed at that location. When a business wishes to move a title loan office to another location the business shall give thirty (30) days prior written notice to the city clerk by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and the city clerk shall then amend the business tax receipt accordingly. A business tax receipt issued pursuant to this part is not transferable or assignable. 
(e)  Books, accounts and records; maintenance and examinations by the city clerk. 
(1)  Each business shall maintain, at the principal place of business designated on the business tax receipt all books, accounts, records, and documents necessary to determine that the business is in compliance with this article. 
(2)  The city clerk may authorize maintenance of records at a location other than a principal place of business. The city clerk may require books and records to be produced and available at a reasonable and convenient location within the city. 
(3)  All books, accounts, records, documents and receipts for expenses paid by the business on behalf of the borrower, including each contract signed by the borrower and expenses incurred by the business in event of foreclosure and property recovery, will be preserved and kept available for examination by the city clerk for two (2) years after the date of original entry. 
(4)  The city clerk may prescribe by rule the minimum information to be shown in the books, accounts, records, and documents of businesses so that such records will enable the city clerk to determine the business is in compliance with this article. 
(f)  Each business shall designate and maintain an agent in this state for service of process. 
(g)  A business must apply to the city clerk for a new local business tax receipt upon a change in ownership of twenty-five (25) percent or more by a natural person in any title loan location or office. No application for a business tax receipt or an application for transfer of an existing business tax receipt is required for any change, directly, or beneficially, in the ownership of a title loan location if one or more of the holders of at least seventy-five (75) percent of the outstanding equity interest in the title loan location or office before the change in ownership continue to hold at least seventy-five (75) percent of the outstanding equity interest in the title loan location or office after the change in ownership. 
(h)  To be eligible for local business tax receipt for a title loan lending business an applicant shall: 
(1)  File with the city clerk a bond in the amount of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) for each business tax receipt with a surety company qualified to do business in this state. In lieu of the bond, the applicant may establish a certificate of deposit or an irrevocable letter of credit in a Florida financial institution in the amount of the bond. The original bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit shall be filed with the city clerk and the city shall be the beneficiary of such instrument. The bond, certificate of deposit, or letter of credit shall be in favor the city for the use and benefit of any consumer who is injured in the context of a title loan transaction by the fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, financial failure, unfair or deceptive trade practice, disclosure violation or violations of any provision of this part by the licensee. Such liability shall be enforced by the filing of a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(2)  Not have been convicted of a felony within the last ten (10) years or be acting in behalf of a beneficial owner who has been convicted of a felony within the last ten (10) years. 
(3)  Not have been convicted, and not acting in behalf of a beneficial owner who has been convicted of a crime that the city finds directly related to the duties and responsibilities of a title loan lender within the past ten (10) years. 
(i)  The city clerk shall determine the form of the local business tax receipt. 
(j)  No part of this article may be construed to impair or affect the obligation of any title loan agreement which was lawfully entered into prior to December 7, 1998. 
(k)  Businesses shall report to the city clerk changes in address, location of records, and any change of an executive officer within thirty (30) days of the change. 
(Ord. No. 2011-8000, § 1, 8-15-11)

ARTICLE II. - CURFEW FOR JUVENILES 

Sec. 16-51. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this article the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory. 
    City is the City of Jacksonville Beach, Florida. 
    Emergency means an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action. The term includes, but is not limited to, a fire, natural disaster, or automobile accident, or any situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life. 
    Establishment means any privately-owned place of business operated for a profit to which the public is invited, including but not limited to any place of amusement or entertainment. 
    Juvenile or minor is any unemancipated person under the age of seventeen (17), or in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person sixteen (16) or less years of age. 
    Operator is any individual, firm, association, partnership, or corporation operating, managing, or conducting any establishment. The term includes the members or partners of an association or partnership and the officers of a corporation. 
    Parent is any person having legal custody of a juvenile (i) as a natural or adoptive parent, (ii) as a legal guardian, (iii) as a person who stands in loco parentis, or (iv) as a person to whom legal custody has been given by court order. 
    Public place means any place to which the public or a substantial group of the public has access and includes, but is not limited to, streets, common areas of schools, shopping centers, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, transportation facilities, theaters, restaurants, shops, bowling alleys, taverns, cafes, arcades, and similar areas that are open to the use of the public. As a type of public place, a street is a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. "Street" includes that legal right-of-way, including but not limited to, the cartway of traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. 
    Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily in a public place including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four (4) or more persons in which any juvenile involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home, or to fail to leave the premises of an establishment when requested to do so by a police officer or the operator of an establishment. To implement this provision with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in the ordinance. More and more exceptions become available with a juvenile's increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation. 
    Time of night referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Savings Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city; prima facie the time then observed in the city administrative offices and police station. 
    Years of age continues from one birthday, such as the sixteenth to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the seventeenth birthday, making it clear that sixteen (16) or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under seventeen years of age," the latter phrase in practice, unfortunately, having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that seventeen (17) years old might be involved. Similarly, for example, eleven (11) or less years of age means "under 12 years of age." 
(Ord. No. 94-7612, § 1, 12-19-95) 
Sec. 16-52. - Curfew for juveniles. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person sixteen (16) or less of age (under seventeen (17)) to be or remain in or upon a public place within the City of Jacksonville Beach, Florida, during the period ending at 5:00 a.m.and beginning: 
(1)  At 12:30 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights; and 
(2)  11:30 p.m. on all other nights. 
(Ord. No. 94-7612, § 2, 12-19-95) 
Sec. 16-53. - Exceptions. 
    The following shall constitute valid exceptions to the operation of this article: 
(1)  When a juvenile is accompanied by a parent of such juvenile. 
(2)  When a juvenile is accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such juvenile to take said parent's place in accompanying said juvenile for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area. 
(3)  When a juvenile is exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly, by first delivering to the person designated by the city's chief of police to receive such information in a written communication, signed by the juvenile and countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of the juvenile with their home address and telephone number, specifying when, where and in what manner the juvenile will be in a public place during hours when the ordinance is applicable to said minor in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication. 
(4)  When a juvenile is on the sidewalk or property where the juvenile resides, or on either side of or across the street from the place where the juvenile resides and the adult owner or resident of that property has given permission for the juvenile to be there. 
(5)  When a juvenile is returning home by a direct route (without any unnecessary detour or stop) from and within one hour of the termination of a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary association, or a place of public entertainment, such as a movie, play or sporting event. If the event is not commercial in nature or does not have a fixed, publicly known time at which it will or does end, the sponsoring organization must register the event with the chief of police (or his assigned representative) at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, informing the police department of the time that such event is scheduled to begin, the place at which it shall be held, the time at which it shall end, and the name of the sponsoring organization. 
(6)  When authorized, by special permit from the chief of police carried on the person of the juvenile thus authorized, as follows. When necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this article, then recourse may be had to the chief of police, either for a regulation as provided in subsection (9) or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. Upon the findings of reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile and by a parent of the juvenile, if feasible, stating (1) the name, age and address of the juvenile; (2) the name, address, and telephone number of a parent thereof; (3) the height, weigh, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of the juvenile; (4) the necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a public place during the curfew hours otherwise application; (5) the public place; and (6) the beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour, the chief and [of] police may grant a permit in writing for the juvenile's use of a public place at such hours as in the option of the chief of police may reasonably be necessary and consistent with the purposes of the ordinance. In an emergency this may be handled by telephone or other effective communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously to the chief of police or to the person designated by the chief of police to act on his or her behalf in an emergency, at the police station. 
(7)  When authorized, by regulation issued by the chief of police in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to reasonably necessary night-time activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the chief of police permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this article. 
(8)  When the juvenile is legally employed and carries a certified card of employment, renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not more than ninety (90) days previously, signed by the chief of police and briefly identifying the juvenile, the addressed of the juvenile's home and of the juvenile's place of employment, and the juvenile's hours of employment. 
(9)  When the juvenile is, with parental consent, engaged in normal interstate travel through the city or originating or terminating in the city. 
(10)  When the juvenile is married or has been married pursuant to state law. 
(11)  In the case of an operator of an establishment, when the operator has notified the police that a juvenile was present on the premises of the establishment during curfew hours and refused to leave. 
(Ord. No. 94-7612, § 3, 12-19-95) 
Sec. 16-54. - Parental responsibility. 
    It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a juvenile knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow the juvenile to remain in any city public place under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in the parent's legal custody. This requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile. 
(Ord. No. 94-7612, § 4, 12-19-95) 
Sec. 16-55. - Operator responsibility. 
    It shall be unlawful for any operator of an establishment to knowingly permit a juvenile to remain at the establishment under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this article. 
    The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that an operator should reasonable be expected to have concerning the patrons of the establishment. The standard for "knowingly" shall be applied through an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's position should have known that the patron was a juvenile in violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 94-7612, § 5, 12-19-95) 
Sec. 16-56. - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  Before taking any action under this article, a police officer shall ask the apparent juvenile's age and reason for being in the public place. The officer shall not issue the juvenile a written warning that the juvenile is in violation of this article unless the officer reasonably believes that a violation has occurred and that, based upon the response received and other circumstances, no exception as outlined in section 16-53 is present. If a police officer reasonably believed that a juvenile is in a public place in violation of this article, the officer shall notify the juvenile that he or she is in violation of this article and shall require the juvenile to provide his or her name, address and telephone number and how to contact his or her parent or guardian. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer shall, in the first instance of violation of this article, use his or her best judgement in determining age. 
(b)  The police officer shall issue the juvenile a written warning that the juvenile is in violation of this article and order the juvenile to go promptly home. The chief of police shall send the parent or guardian of the juvenile written notice of the violation pursuant to section 16-54. 
(c)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, when: (i) a juvenile has received one previous written warning for violation of this article; or (ii) a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile has engaged in delinquent conduct, the procedure shall then be to take the juvenile to the police station where a parent or guardian shall immediately be notified to come for the juvenile whereupon the parent or guardian and the juvenile shall be questioned. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the person designated there and then on' duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus, making available experienced personnel and access to information and records. 
(d)  When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take charge of the juvenile, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may temporarily be entrusted to an adult, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent or guardian assume the responsibility of caring for the juvenile pending the availability or arrival of a parent or guardian. 
(e)  In the case of a first violation of this article by a juvenile, the chief of police shall by certified mail send to a parent or guardian written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this article, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(f)  For the first violation of this article by an operator of an establishment who permits a juvenile to remain on the premises, a police office shall issue a written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this article, including enforcement of operator responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(g)  In any event the police officer shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, file a written report with the chief of police or shall participate to the extent of the information for which he or she is responsible in the preparation of a report on the curfew violation. It is not the intention of this section to require extensive reports that will prevent police officers from performing their primary police duties. The reports shall be as simple as is reasonably possible and may be completed by police departmental personnel other than sworn police officers.

Sec. 16-57. - Penalties. 
(a)  If, after the warning notice pursuant to section 16-56 of a first violation by a juvenile, a parent violates section 16-54 (in connection with a second violation by the juvenile), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For the first offense by a parent, the fine shall be fifty dollars ($50.00), and for each subsequent offense by a parent the fine shall be increased by an additional fifty dollars ($50.00), e.g. one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the second offense, one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for the third offense. The judge of the appropriate court, upon finding a parent guilty, shall sentence the parent to pay this fine and the cost of prosecution. 
(b)  The parent or legal guardian having custody of a juvenile subject to this section shall be liable for all costs incurred by the city for providing personnel to remain in the company of a juvenile who has been detained as a curfew violator, if the parent or guardian does not pick up the juvenile within one hour after receiving notice from the city, that the city is detaining the juvenile for a curfew violation. The amount to be paid by the parent or guardian shall be based on the hourly wage of the city employee who is assigned to remain with the juvenile plus the cost of benefits for the employee. 
(c)  The parent or legal guardian having custody of a juvenile subject to this section shall be liable for any fine or condition of restitution or reparation imposed by a court upon a curfew violator, provided that the curfew violator has not paid the fine or made restitution or reparation within the time ordered by the court, and further provided that the parent or legal guardian has been made a party defendant in all enforcement proceedings against the curfew violator and shall be served with all citations, summons, complaints, notices, and other documents required to be served on the curfew violator defendant. 
(d)  Any juvenile who shall violate any of the provisions of this article more than three (3) times shall be reported by the chief of police to the juvenile authorities as a juvenile in need of supervision and the chief of police may proceed to file such charges with the courts as he may deem appropriate. 
(e)  If, after the warning notice pursuant to section 16-56 of a violation of this article, an operator of an establishment violates section 16-55 a second time, this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For the first offense by an operator, the fine shall be fifty dollars ($50.00), and for each subsequent offense by an operator the fine shall be increased by an additional fifty dollars ($50.00), e.g. one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the second offense, one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for the third offense.

(a)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, certain words and phrases used herein are defined as follows: 
    A-band level is the total sound level of all noise as measured with a sound level meter using the A weighing network. The unit of measurement is the dB(A). 
    Daytime is defined as 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and nighttime is defined as 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. in residential use occupancies. 
    Decibel is a unit (dba) of sound equal to ten (10) times the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of any two (2) quantities proportional to power. 
    Emergency work is the work made necessary to protect persons or property from exposure to danger. 
    Noise level is the sound pressure level as measured in dB(A) by a sound level meter. 
    Outdoor restaurant or bar means any restaurant or bar, or portion thereof, which exists outside of the permanent exterior walls of the principal building(s) on a lot. This definition includes any deck or other area constructed and/or utilized on the roof of a structure.

    Plainly audible shall mean any sound that can be heard clearly by a person using his or her unaided hearing faculties. When music is involved, the detection of rhythmic bass tones shall be sufficient to be considered plainly audible sound. 
    Sound-level meter is an instrument including a microphone, an amplifier, an outlet meter, and frequency weighing networks for the measurement of noise and sound levels in a specified manner. 
    Sound pressure level, in decibels, of sound is twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of this sound to the reference pressure, which reference pressure must be explicitly stated. 
    All time referred to in this chapter shall be the then current legal time in the City of Jacksonville Beach. 
    All technical definitions are in accordance with American Standard S1.1-1960 entitled, "Acoustical Terminology." 
(b)  Classification of use occupancies; projection of noise from one use to another. 
(1)  Classification. For purposes of defining the "use occupancy", all premises containing habitually occupied sleeping quarters shall be considered in residential use. 
All premises containing businesses where sales, professional or other commercial use is legally permitted shall be considered commercial use. 
All premises where manufacturing is legally permitted shall be considered manufacturing use. 
In cases of multiple uses, the more restrictive use category shall prevail. Hospitals, schools, and church areas are considered residential. Any area not otherwise classified shall conform to commercial standards. 
(2)  Projection of noise. Sound or noise projecting from one use occupancy to another use occupancy with a different noise level shall exceed neither the limits of the use occupancy into which the noise is projected nor the noise limits of the use occupancy from which the noise originates. 
(c)  Measurement of noise. 
(1)  The measurement of sound or noise shall be made with a sound level meter meeting the standards prescribed by the American National Standards Institute, S1.4 American National Standard Specifications for sound level meters. The instruments shall be maintained in calibration and good working order. A calibration check shall be made of the system at the time of any noise measurement. Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper representation of the noise source. The microphone during measurement shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural enhancement or diminution of the measured noise. A windscreen for the microphone shall be used at all times. 
(2)  The slow meter response of the sound level meter shall be used in order to best determine the average amplitude. 
(3)  The measurement shall be made at any point outside of the property line from where the noise is being transmitted. 
(4)  In case of multiple occupancy of a property, the measurement may be made at any point inside the premises to which any complainant has right of legal private occupancy; provided, that the measurement shall not be made within three (3) feet of any ground, wall, floor, ceiling, roof or other plane surface. 
(5)  All noise measurements provided for in this chapter will be made by officials of the city who are qualified to operate the apparatus used to make the measurements as provided for in this chapter. 
(d)  Tables of noise level limits. 
(1)  Table I. Table I specifies noise levels which represent limits which if exceeded interfere with the peace, quiet and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants.

ARTICLE III. - AGGRESSIVE SOLICITATION[2] 

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 98-7729, §§ 1-4, adopted Feb. 16, 1998, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Art. III, §§ 21-41-21-44 was at the discretion of the editor. See the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 21-41. - Legislative findings. 
(a)  The council finds that the increase in aggressive solicitation throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses, and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. 
(b)  Aggressive solicitation usually includes approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive soliciting despite refusals, the use of abusive or profane language to cause fear and intimidation, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The council further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks, automated teller machines, or in public transportation vehicles is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in those confined environments. Motorists also find themselves confronted by persons seeking money who, without permission, wash their automobile windows at traffic intersections, despite explicit indications by drivers not to do so. Such activity carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property. People driving or parking on city streets frequently find themselves faced with persons seeking money by offering to open car doors or locate parking spaces. 
(c)  The council is enacting this article pursuant to its police power, as stated in Chapter IX of the City Charter and Section 166.021, Florida Statutes. This law is timely and appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems. 
(d)  The law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity. Rather, its goal is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city. 
(Ord. No. 98-7729, § 1, 2-16-98) 
Sec. 21-42. - Definitions.

(2)  Following the person being solicited, if that conduct is: (i) intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's possession; or (ii) is intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation; 
(3)  Continuing to solicit within five (5) feet of the person being solicited after the person has made a negative response, if continuing the solicitation is: (i) intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's possession; or (ii) is intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation; 
(4)  Intentionally or recklessly blocking the safe or free passage of the person being solicited or requiring the person, or the driver of a vehicle, to take evasive action to avoid physical contact with the person making the solicitation. Acts authorized as an exercise of one's constitutional right to picket or legally protest shall not constitute obstruction of pedestrian or vehicular traffic; 
(5)  Intentionally or recklessly using obscene or abusive language or gestures: (i) intended to or likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's possession; or (ii) words intended to or reasonably likely to intimidate the person into responding affirmatively to the solicitation; or

    Solicit means to request an immediate donation of money or other thing of value from another person, regardless of the solicitor's purpose or intended use of the money or other thing of value. 
(Ord. No. 98-7729, § 2, 2-16-98) 
Sec. 21-43. - Prohibited acts. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit money or other things of value, or to solicit the sale of goods or services: 
(1)  In an aggressive manner in a public area;

Sec. 21-44. - Penalties.

--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, adopted Dec. 18, 2017 , amended Art. IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. IV, §§ 28-70-28-86, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2001-7813, adopted June 4, 2001. 

Sec. 28-70. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the Jacksonville Beach Communications Facilities Rights-of-Way Ordinance. 
( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 ) 
Sec. 28-71. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  The city hereby makes and declares the following findings and declares its legislative intent as follows: 
(1)  The public rights-of-way within the City of Jacksonville Beach are a unique and physically limited resource and important amenity that are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the city. 
(2)  The demand for telecommunications services has grown exponentially in recent years, requiring the continual upgrading of telecommunications equipment and services to satisfy such demand. 
(3)  The placement of telecommunications equipment and facilities in the public rights-of-way to satisfy the demand for telecommunications services raises important issues with respect to the city's responsibility to manage its public rights-of-way. 
(4)  The public rights-of-way must be managed and controlled in a manner that enhances the health, safety and general welfare of the city and its citizens. 
(5)  The use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way by providers of communications services must be subject to regulation, which can ensure minimal inconvenience to the public, coordinate users, maximize available space, reduce maintenance and costs to the public, and facilitate entry of an optimal number of providers of cable, telecommunications, and other services in the public interest. 
(6)  Section 166.041, Florida Statutes, provides for procedures for adoption of an ordinance which is a regulation of general and permanent nature and enforceable as local law. 
(7)  Section 337.401, Florida Statutes, addresses the authority of municipalities to regulate the placement and maintenance of communication facilities, and other utilities, in the public rights-of-way. 
(8)  In 2017, Florida passed Chapter 2017-136, Laws of Florida, which among other things, amends § 337.401, Florida Statutes, to create the new Subsection (7) known as the Advanced Wireless Infrastructure Deployment Act ("Wireless Deployment Act"), effective July 1, 2017, to address municipalities' regulation of access to the public rights-of-way for wireless communications facilities and wireless support structures. 
(9)  The Wireless Deployment Act provides that municipalities may require a registration process in accordance with § 337.401(3), Florida Statutes, may adopt by ordinance provisions for insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, municipality liability or municipal warranties and further provides that, for any applications filed before the effective date of ordinances implementing this subsection, an authority may apply current ordinances relating to the placement of communications facilities in the rights-of-way related to registration, permitting, insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, municipality liability or municipal warranties. 
(10)  The city is exempt under 47 U.S.C. § 224 from federal pole attachment requirements, and finds that it is a "municipal electric utility" such that the city utility poles are not subject to the Wireless Deployment Act's "Collocation" requirements as stated in § 337.401(7)(I), Florida Statutes, currently set forth in Chapter 2017-136, Laws of Florida. 
(11)  The communication industry is in a constant state of emerging technology that includes the infrastructure required to support the increased demand and capacity to receive and to transmit increased data and voice communications. 
(12)  A new network of wireless communications infrastructure has emerged comprised of a series of small individual antenna ("small cells"), or nodes ("distributed antenna systems" or "DAS"), and wireless backhaul networks that are linked to a larger hub site. 
(13)  The city has received requests to place new utility poles, wireless communications facilities, and wireless support structures within the public rights-of-way. 
(14)  The current City Code contains requirements for registration, insurance, permitting, insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, municipality liability or municipal warranties that address sufficiently the placement or maintenance within the public rights-of-way for wireline and wireless communications facilities or wireless support structures, but needs to be updated to incorporate state law changes since the adoption of the original ordinance in 2001. 
(15)  The city finds that, to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, it is necessary to: 
i.  Provide for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city limits, 
ii.  Adopt and administer reasonable rules, regulations and general conditions not inconsistent with applicable state and federal law, 
iii.  Manage the placement and maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers, 
iv.  Minimize disruption to the public rights-of-way, and 
v.  Require the restoration of the public rights-of-way to original condition. 
(16)  It is the intent of the city to require that the placement or maintenance of any wireline or wireless communications facility or wireless support structure in the public rights-of-way must have an effective registration which satisfies the requirements set forth herein for such registration, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. 
(17)  It is also the city's intent to exercise the city's retained authority to regulate and manage the city's roads and rights-of-way in exercising its police power over communications services providers' placement and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner. 
(b)  This article IV of City Code Chapter 28 shall apply to any public or private entity who seeks to construct, place, install, maintain or operate a communications system or facilities, as such terms are defined herein, in the public rights-of-way, unless otherwise exempt by operation of applicable state or federal law. Notwithstanding the above, this article IV of City Code Chapter 28 shall not apply whatsoever to a city owned or controlled communications system. 
( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 )

( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 ) 
Sec. 28-73. - Registration. 
    (a) A communications services company or provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this section, as amended, a registrant may place and maintain communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  The act of registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the city's public rights-of-way. Registration under this article embodies only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes, or regulations apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities, which are not communications facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services company or provider from obtaining appropriate and required access or pole attachment agreements before locating communication facilities on the city's facilities or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services company or provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes, or regulations including this section. 
(c)  Each communications services company or provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a registration with the city, which shall include the following information: 
(1)  Name of the applicant; 
(2)  Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration, and the name, address, and telephone number of the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(3)  Registrations submitted prior to December 18, 2017, shall state if the applicant provides local service, toll service, or both; 
(4)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this section and acknowledgment that applicant has received and reviewed a copy of this section; however, the acknowledgment of the receipt of this section shall not be deemed an agreement; 
(5)  The type of communications services that the applicant intends to provide within the corporate limits of the city (if more than one, state all that apply), or, if none, state that the applicant is a pass-through provider or is intending only to place and maintain pass-through facilities, as the case may be; 
(6)  For registrations submitted on or after December 18, 2017, a copy of both the applicant's resale certificate and certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Revenue to engage in the business of providing communications services in the State of Florida; and 
(7)  The applicant's certificate of authorization or license number to provide communications services issued by the state public service commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any, having jurisdiction; 
(8)  For an applicant that does not provide a state public service commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to conduct business in the state. A certificate number from, or filing with, the Florida Department of State will be acceptable; 
(9)  For an applicant that is a pass-through provider, in lieu of paragraphs (5), (6), (7) and (8) above, the applicant shall provide a certified copy of the certificate or license issued by the Florida Department of State, or other appropriate state agency or department, authorizing the company to do business in the State of Florida. 
(d)  The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. The city manager or the city manager's designee shall conduct such review. If the applicant submits information in accordance with this article, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant in writing of the effectiveness of the registration. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with this article, the city shall notify the applicant in writing of the non-effectiveness of the registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness. The city shall notify an applicant within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the registration information from the applicant. Non-effectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that registrant will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and registrant will no longer require permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant shall not cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration does not establish a right or provide authority to place and maintain or establish priority for the future placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city, but shall establish for the registrant, a right to apply for a permit from the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any new or existing city laws, as well as any new or existing federal or state laws, rules, and regulations which may be enacted or which have been enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by the first day of April of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this section, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within thirty (30) calendar days of any change in the information required herein, a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If the information in the then-existing registration has not changed, the renewal may provide that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services company or provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes, regulations, or policies a permit shall be required of a communications services company or provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An acceptable and approved registration shall be a condition precedent to requesting and obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an acceptable and approved registration, permitting requirements shall always apply. A permit may be obtained by a registrant having an acceptable and approved registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 ) 
Sec. 28-74. - Notice of transfer, sale, or assignment of assets. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells, or assigns the assets located in public rights-of-way or incident to a transfer, sale, or assignment of the registrant's assets the transferee, the buyer, or the assignee shall be fully obligated to comply with the terms of this section. Written notice of any such transfer, sale, or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within twenty (20) calendar days after the effective date of the transfer, sale, or assignment. If the transferee, buyer, or assignee is a current registrant then the transferee, buyer, or assignee may not be required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer, or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer, or assignee shall register as provided herein within thirty (30) calendar days of the transfer, sale, or assignment. If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name the transferee, buyer, or assignee shall notify the city that the transferee, buyer, or assignee is the new applicant. 
( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 ) 
Sec. 28-75. - Placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
    As a condition of allowing the placement or maintenance of a communications system or any communications facility in the public rights-of-way, and under additional authority granted pursuant to Chapter 337, Florida Statutes, the city hereby imposes the following rules, regulations and general conditions. Unless otherwise provided in this article IV, these rules, regulations and general conditions shall apply to all communications services providers, including those that are pass-through providers irrespective of whether they place and maintain only conduit, dark fiber or pass-through facilities.

(b)  Neither a registrant nor a communications service provider shall commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the city and other appropriate authorities. Registrant acknowledges and accepts, that as a condition of granting any permits, the city may impose reasonable rules, regulations, and policies governing the location, placement, and maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. The communications services provider shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and shall, after-the-fact, be required to submit plans and record drawings and as-built surveys, if required by the city manager or his designee, showing the placement or relocation of a communications facility undertaken in connection with the emergency. 
(c)  As part of the permit application to place a new or replace or maintain an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide not less than the following: 
(1)  A description of the location of the proposed facilities including a narrative description and a scaled pictorial drawing of the facilities to be installed, where the facilities are to be located, and the size of facilities to be located in public rights-of-way; and 
(2)  A description of the construction methods or techniques which will be used to install the facilities; and 
(3)  A maintenance plan for disruption of traffic; and 
(4)  A statement concerning the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed facility; and 
(5)  An estimate of the cost of the restoration to the public rights-of-way; and 
(6)  A timetable for project construction and each phase thereof, and the areas within the city which will be affected; and 
(7)  Such additional information as the city finds necessary with respect to the placement or maintenance of the communications facility that is the subject of the permit application. 
(d)  To the extent not otherwise prohibited by federal or state laws, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within particular areas of all public rights-of-way. 
(e)  All communications facilities shall be placed and maintained so as not to interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology, joint trenching, and co-locating of facilities in existing conduit in the public rights-of-way is encouraged and shall be employed when feasible. The city manager or the city manager's designee may promulgate rules, regulations, and policies concerning the placement and maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this article and other applicable federal and state laws. 
(f)  All safety practices required by applicable municipal, state, and federal laws or accepted industry practices and standards, shall be used during the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(g)  After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, the registrant shall at the registrant's expense, restore the public rights-of-way to the original condition, or superior to the original condition, which existed before such placement or maintenance. If the registrant fails to complete the restoration within thirty (30) calendar days, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform the restoration and charge the total costs of the restoration to the registrant in accordance with § 337.402, Florida Statutes as amended. For twelve (12) calendar months following the original completion date of the work, the registrant shall guarantee the restoration work and shall correct, at the Registrant's expense, any restoration work, which does not satisfy the requirements of the city. 
(h)  Removal or relocation, at the direction of the city of a registrant's existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, shall be governed by the provisions of §§ 337.403 and 337.404, Florida Statutes, as amended. 
(i)  An approved permit from the city shall constitute authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and the permit does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j)  A registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(k)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in Ch. 556, Florida Statutes, as amended. 
(l)  A registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care, and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable and necessary steps to safeguard the entire work area and the general public. 
(m)  Upon request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation, or repairs, a registrant may be required to coordinate all placement and all maintenance activities with any other work, construction, installation, or repairs which may be occurring, or scheduled to occur, in public rights-of-way. A registrant may be required to alter an installation and maintenance schedule to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(n)  A registrant shall not place or maintain communications facilities, which interfere with, displace, damage, or destroy other facilities including, but not limited to, sewer mains, gas mains, water mains, electric facilities, stormwater drains, pipes, cables, conduits, and all other facilities occupying the public rights-of-way. 
(o)  The city makes no expressed or implied warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of the city public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred, or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's exclusive risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city authority to add, increase, vacate, or abandon public rights-of-way, and the city makes no expressed or implied warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, increased, vacated, or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(p)  The city shall have the right and authority to make any inspections, at any time, of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as the city determines necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(q)  A permit application to place a new or maintain an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way shall include plan and profile drawings, which show the actual location of the facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the drawings require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant shall promptly provide the revised as-built drawings to the city. The drawings shall be in a hard copy format and an electronic format specified by the city. All such drawings, data and information shall be provided at no cost to the city. 
(r)  The city reserves, without limitation, the exclusive right to place, maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, all sewer, gas, water, electric, stormwater drainage, communications, all other types of facilities, cables, or conduits and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installations or improvements which may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way that may be occupied by a registrant. The city further reserves, without limitation, the exclusive right to alter, change, or cause to be altered or changed the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as the limits may, from time to time, be altered. 
(s)  A registrant shall, upon request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily adjust any communications facilities to allow for work authorized by other permits. The expense of such temporary adjustments of facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the adjustment and the registrant shall have the right to request such payment of expense in advance. If the city requests temporary or permanent adjustments of a registrant's existing or proposed facilities to allow for work to be done by the city, its contractors, or its agents, however, all expenses and costs related to the adjustments of the registrant's temporary or permanent facilities, shall be the responsibility of and shall be paid by the registrant. The registrant shall be given not less than fifteen (15) calendar days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary or permanent adjustments. 
(t)  Any communications facilities placed in the public rights-of-way by the communications services provider without first having obtained the required communications facilities development permits shall be removed within thirty (30) days of written notice by the city to remove the same and in default of compliance with such notice, such facilities may be removed by order of the city manager or his designee and the cost of removal shall be borne and paid by the communications services provider upon demand. 
(u)  The placement or maintenance of all communications facilities shall be underground unless otherwise approved in writing and in compliance with the most current version of the provisions of article IV, City Code Chapter 28. Communications facilities shall be placed between the property line and the curb line of all streets and avenues and shall not be within the roadway or the roadway recovery area unless specifically approved in writing by the city manager or his designee. All communications facilities shall have consistent alignment parallel with the edge of pavement, a thirty-six inch (36") minimum depth of cover for and shall have a minimum of two feet (2') of horizontal clearance from other underground utilities and their appurtenances. Where approved by the city manager or his designee, facilities to be placed in the street shall be laid according to the permanent grade of the street and at a depth below the surface of the permanent grade as each is determined by the city manager or his designee. The city retains the final decision on vertical depth and/or height location and horizontal location within the right-of-way of communications facilities and appurtenances. 
(v)  The placement or maintenance of facilities aboveground, including new utility poles and aerial wires, is subject to written approval and to compliance with the most current version of the provisions of article IV, City Code Chapter 28. Attachment to any pole or other aboveground structure must be pursuant to a valid and effective pole attachment agreement or similar instrument. Location on any utility pole or other above-ground structure shall not be considered a vested interest of the communications services provider and such utility poles or structures, if owned by the communications services provider, shall be removed or modified by the communications services provider at its own expense whenever the city or other governmental authority determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The communications services provider shall, at such time as the electric utility facilities or other communications facilities are placed underground or are required by the city to be placed underground, concurrently place its communications facilities underground without cost to the city. The city retains the final decision on vertical depth and/or height location and horizontal location within the right-of-way of communications facilities and appurtenances. 
(w)  The placing of any new utility pole or other aboveground structure to support communications facilities is subject to written approval and to compliance with the most current version of the provisions of article IV, City Code Chapter 28 and shall be done under the supervision of the city manager or his designee. No such utility pole or other aboveground structure shall be placed in any gutter or drainage area and must be behind the curb to avoid damage to any sidewalk. In areas of the city where either electric utility wires or other communications facilities are aboveground and such facilities are moved, either voluntarily or at the direction of the city, to a new utility pole or other above-ground structure, the communications services provider or wireless infrastructure provider shall likewise move all its above-ground facilities on such utility poles or structures to such new utility pole or structure within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from either the city or the owner of the new utility pole or structure, without cost to the city. New utility poles installed by wireless infrastructure providers shall also be subject to and may avail themselves of the requirements and process set forth in section 28-76 hereof. The city retains the final decision on vertical depth and/or height location and horizontal location within the rights-of-way of communications facilities and appurtenances. 
(x)  A communications services provider, in an effort to minimize the adverse impact on the useful life of the public rights-of-way, shall, whenever possible, enter into joint use agreements with the city and other parties who have registered with, or who are expressly authorized by, the city to use its public rights-of-way; provided that the terms of such agreements are satisfactory to the communications services provider. Nothing herein contained shall mandate that the communications services provider enter into joint use agreements with parties other than the city or an agency of the city. However, prior to placement of any new or additional underground conduit in the public rights-of-way, a communications services provider is required to certify in writing to the city manager or his designee that it has made appropriate inquiry to all existing utilities and other entities possessing a right to occupy the public rights-of-way as to the availability of existing or planned conduit that the particular communications services provider could reasonably utilize to meet its needs, and that no such conduit is available or planned at a reasonable cost by any other entity on the time schedule reasonably needed. The communications services provider shall not be permitted to perform any placement or maintenance of facilities in those segments of the public rights-of-way where there exists vacant or available conduit, dark fiber or surplus fiber owned by the city, an agency of the city or another governmental body which is or, through a reasonable amount of effort and expense, can be made compatible with the communications services provider's system or network. Under such circumstances the communications services provider shall have the opportunity to enter into a use agreement or lease arrangement with the city or an agency of the city at or below reasonable and prevailing market rates for such conduit or fiber or, where owned by another governmental body, shall, in good faith, first exhaust all means of obtaining use of such conduit or fiber before applying for a communications facilities development permit from the city. The city retains the final decision on vertical depth and/or height location and horizontal location within the rights-of-way of communications facilities and appurtenances. 
( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 ) 
Sec. 28-76. - Wireless facilities. 
(a)  Generally. The placement of telecommunication towers and antennae anywhere in the corporate limits of the city shall in all cases be subject to the city's zoning and land use regulations, including those set forth in the most current version of sections 34-409 and 34-410 in the city's Land Development Code, which is a part of the City Code. Where placement of a wireless antenna in the public rights-of-way has been approved by the city and to the extent not inconsistent with any city zoning and land use regulations, a wireless antenna attached to a permitted and legally maintained vertical structure in the public rights-of-way, such as a light pole or utility pole, shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the city in writing: 
(1)  Not extend more than ten (10) feet above the highest point of the vertical structure; 
(2)  Not have any type of lighted signal, lights, or illuminations unless required by an applicable federal, state, or local rule, regulation or law; 
(3)  Comply with any applicable Federal Communications Commission Emissions Standards; 
(4)  Comply with any applicable local building codes in terms of design, construction and installation; and 
(5)  Not contain any commercial advertising thereon. 
(b)  Small wireless facilities in public rights-of way. The city is exempt under 47 U.S.C. § 224 from federal pole attachment requirements, and finds that it is a "municipal electric utility" such that the city utility poles are not subject to the Wireless Deployment Act's "Collocation" requirements as stated in § 337.401(7)(I), Florida Statutes, currently set forth in Chapter 2017-136, Laws of Florida. Unless and until the city adopts an ordinance regulating pole attachments, the city reserves the right to approve or deny individual requests for pole attachments to city utility poles within its sole discretion. 
(c)  Placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way in support of collocation of small wireless facilities. A wireless infrastructure provider may apply to the city to place utility poles in the public rights-of-way to support the collocation of small wireless facilities. The application must include an attestation that small wireless facilities will be collocated on the utility pole or structure and will be used by a wireless services provider to provide service within 9 months after the date the application is approved by the city, and the application must contain an attestation that the applicant cannot find a leasable site for the utility pole on private property within the city. The city shall accept and process the application in accordance with the procedure set forth below and any applicable codes and other local codes governing the placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way. Applicants seeking permission to install new utility poles within public rights-of-way shall comply with the registration, insurance coverage, indemnification, performance bonds, security funds, force majeure, abandonment, city liability, and city warranties provisions contained in this Chapter 28. 
(1)  Filing, review, and processing of applications. The city shall accept applications for permits and shall process and issue permits for the placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way in support of collocation of small wireless facilities subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Prior to filing any such application, the applicant shall notify the city and schedule a pre-application conference for the purpose of notifying and disclosing all information relevant to the city's assessment of any application to be filed hereunder. No such application may be filed until the pre-application meeting has been scheduled and conducted. The pre-application meeting shall be scheduled and held at least fourteen (14) days prior to the filing of any such application. 
b.  The applicant shall as a part of its application provide information necessary to demonstrate the applicant's compliance with § 337.401(7), Florida Statutes, the applicable provisions of Chapter 28 and other applicable provisions of the City Code for the placement of a new utility pole in the locations identified in the application, and shall bear the burden of demonstrating compliance therewith. 
c.  Within fourteen (14) days after receiving an application, the city must determine and notify the applicant by electronic mail as to whether the application is complete. If an application is deemed incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing information. An application is deemed complete if the city fails to provide notification to the applicant within fourteen (14) days. If the applicant fails to complete the application within thirty (30) days after receiving a notice from the city that the application is deemed incomplete, then the city may deny the application. 
d.  The city shall process all applications on a nondiscriminatory basis. If the city fails to approve or deny a complete application within sixty (60) days after receipt of the application, the application is deemed approved. The parties may mutually agree to extend the 60-day application review period. The city shall grant or deny the application at the end of the extended period. 
e.  A permit issued pursuant to an approved application shall remain effective for one (1) year unless extended by the city. 
f.  The city shall notify the applicant of approval or denial by electronic mail. The city shall approve a complete application unless it does not meet the applicable provisions of § 337.401(7), Florida Statutes, this Chapter 28, and other applicable provisions of the City Code. 
g.  If the application is denied, the city shall specify in writing the basis for denial, including the specific statutory or code provisions on which the denial is based, and shall send the documentation to the applicant by electronic mail on the day the city denies the application. 
h.  The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the application within thirty (30) days after notice of the denial is sent to the applicant. Failure by the applicant to resubmit the Application timely shall result in a final denial of the application. The city shall approve or deny a timely filed revised application within thirty (30) days after receipt or the application is deemed approved. Any subsequent review shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. 
(2)  The city may deny a proposed new utility pole in the public rights-of-way if the proposed new utility pole violates or fails to comply with one or more of the following: 
a.  Violates or fails to comply with any provision of § 337.401(7), Florida Statutes. 
b.  Violates or fails to comply with any provision of Chapter 28, City Code, as amended from time to time. 
c.  Violates or fails to comply with any provision of sections 34-409 and 34-410 in the city's Land Development Code. 
d.  Violates or fails to comply with any provision related to historic preservation set forth in the City Code, as amended from time to time. 
e.  Materially interferes with the safe operation of traffic control equipment. 
f.  Materially interferes with sight lines or clear zones for transportation, pedestrians, or public safety purposes. 
g.  Materially interferes with compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards regarding pedestrian access or movement. 
( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 ) 
Sec. 28-77. - Suspension of permits. 
    The city shall have the exclusive authority to suspend or revoke a permit for any work in the public rights-of-way for due cause and for one or more of the following reasons: 
(a)  Violation of permit conditions including any conditions set forth in the permit, this section, or other applicable city ordinances, codes, policies, rules or regulations governing placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way; and 
(b)  Misrepresentation or fraud by registrant in a registration or permit application to the city; and 
(c)  Failure to properly renew a registration or ineffectiveness of a registration; and 
(d)  Failure to relocate or remove facilities as required by the city. The city manager or the city manager's designee may provide a notice and the opportunity for a registrant to cure any violation or failure described herein. 
( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 ) 
Sec. 28-78. - Involuntary termination of registration. 
(a)  The city may terminate a registration for due cause, reason, and for one or more of the following: 
(1)  Federal or state authority suspends, denies, or revokes a registrant's certification or license to provide communication services; or 
(2)  The registrant's placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-way presents a danger to the general public or other users of the public rights-of-way and the registrant fails to remedy the danger promptly after receipt of notice; or 
(3)  The registrant ceases to use all of the communications facilities in public rights-of-way or has not complied with the requirements of this section. 
(b)  Prior to termination, the registrant shall be notified by the city manager or the city manager's designee, by a written notice, which sets forth all pertinent matters to the proposed termination action and describing the intended action of the city. The registrant shall have thirty (30) calendar days after the date of such notice to eliminate the reasons for the termination. In the event the registrant has not eliminated the reasons for the notice of termination at the end of the thirty (30) calendar day period, the termination shall be final. 
(c)  In the event of termination, a former registrant shall: (a) notify the city of any anticipated assumption by another registrant of ownership of the terminated registrant's communications facilities in public rights-of-way; and (b) provide the city with an acceptable plan for disposition of its communications facilities in public rights-of-way. If a terminated registrant fails to comply with this section, the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity including, but not limited to, taking possession of the facilities when another person has not assumed ownership or physical control of the facilities or requiring the registrant, within ninety (90) calendar days of the termination or such period as may be agreed to by the registrant, to remove part or all of the facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to the original condition. All expenses incurred by the city or its agents to remove part or all of the facilities and to restore the public rights-of-way to the original condition shall be paid by the registrant. 
(d)  A terminated registrant shall take all steps necessary to render safe every portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(e)  In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not authorize the city to remove or cause the removal of communications facilities used to provide another service for which the registrant or another person who owns or exercises physical control over the facilities holds a valid certification or license with the governing federal or state agency, if required for provision of such service, and is also registered with and holds a valid permit issued by the city. 
( Ord. No. 2017-8099, § 1, 12-18-17 ) 
Sec. 28-79. - Fees applicable to those not subject to communications services tax. 
    While the Florida Legislature has prohibited municipalities from requiring providers of communications services who have registered with the Florida Department of Revenue from having to enter into franchise agreements or license arrangements as a condition to placing or maintaining communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, the city expressly reserves the right to require the payment of consideration or regulatory fees by persons using or occupying the public rights-of-way in other capacities. The city reserves the right to require such payments based on the type of user and to the extent as follows: 
(a)  Dealer. Except as provided in section 28-75(x), a communications services provider who meets the definition of dealer as set forth in state statute and who has registered in accordance with section 28-73 is not required to enter into a franchise agreement or license arrangement with the city as a condition to placing or maintaining communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, nor is a dealer required to make payment of any franchise fees, license fees or other user fees to the city as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the provision of communication services. 
(b)  Pass-through provider and pass-through facilities. A communications services provider who meets the definition of pass-through provider as set forth in this Chapter 28 and who is not subject to the city's local communications services tax imposed pursuant to §§ 202.19 and 202.20, Florida Statutes shall pay the city the maximum annual amount allowed under § 337.401(6)(b), Florida Statutes, as amended. For purposes of calculating payments hereunder, each separate pole or tower installed or maintained by a pass-through provider for purposes of supporting antennas for other over-the-air radio transmission or reception equipment in the public rights-of-way shall comprise a separate communications facility subject to assessment of a separate permit fee in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per linear mile, or portion thereof, up to the maximum amount allowed under § 337.401, Florida Statutes, whichever is higher. The annual amount referred to above shall be due and payable on October 1 of every year beginning on October 1, 2017. Fees not paid within ten (10) days after the due date shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date due until paid. The acceptance of any payment required hereunder by the city shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the amount paid is the correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for additional sums due and payable or authorization to install any facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(c)  Other persons. All other persons, except governmental entities, are required to pay the city, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities, an amount based on and in accordance with section 28-79(b), City Code. 
(d)  Government. A governmental entity is not required to pay the city consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities, unless such facilities are being used by such governmental entity or a communications services provider, including resellers, to offer or provide communication services other than for such governmental entity's internal non-commercial use, in which event the governmental entity, where not subject to the city's local communications services tax imposed pursuant to §§ 202.19 and 202.20, Florida Statutes is required to pay the city, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way by or through its facilities placed therein after December 18, 2017, an amount based on and in accordance with section 28-79(b), City Code, or such other amount or rate of compensation as mutually agreed to in writing by the governmental entity and the city.

Sec. 31-47. - Notice of impoundment. 
(a)  When owner present. When the police intended to impound a motor vehicle pursuant to section 31-46 and the owner of the motor vehicle is then present, the police shall, before the motor vehicle is removed, provide the owner with a notice, in the form prescribed by the chief of police, that the motor vehicle is being impounded, that towing and storage charges will be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle, that the owner may claim and regain possession of the impounded motor vehicle at the location to which it is being removed for storage without prepayment of towing and storage charges, and that the owner may request a hearing as to the propriety of the impoundment and as to the amount of and the owner's liability for the towing and storage charges. The notice shall also state, in prominent language, that failure by the owner to request a hearing within five (5) days after receipt of the notice may act as a waiver of his right to a hearing and that this may result in the placing of a lien against the motor vehicle for the towing and storage charges without further notice to the owner. The owner of the impounded motor vehicle shall sign the notice as an acknowledgement that he has received a copy of the notice and a copy of the notice shall be provided to the owner. 
(b)  When owner not present. 
(1)  When the police impound and remove a motor vehicle and the owner of the motor vehicle is not present at the time of impoundment, the police shall, if the owner resides in the city, as appears from the motor vehicle registration, immediately serve upon the owner of the impounded motor vehicle, at the address on the motor vehicle registration, a notice in the form prescribed by the chief of police, containing the same information as required by subsection (a). Service shall be made as provided by law for service of process generally. If the owner cannot be found at the address on the motor vehicle registration and there is no other known address of the owner, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the state whose whereabouts are unknown and service shall be made on the secretary of state as provided in Section 48.171, Florida Statutes.

(c)  Failure or refusal to sign notice. If any person required by this section to sign a notice of impoundment willfully fails or refuses to do so, or if such person cannot be found, the police shall note this fact on the face of the notice, which shall constitute prima facie evidence of delivery or service of notice as required by this section.

Sec. 31-48. - Impoundment after request to leave motor vehicle.

The police shall be immune from liability for any damage, loss or destruction of the motor vehicle occasioned by its being left unattended pursuant to the request of the owner or operator thereof, in lieu of impoundment. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the police to order the removal of a motor vehicle by its owner or operator or to impound a motor vehicle at any time whenever in his judgment the presence of the unattended motor vehicle constitutes a danger to the public safety. 
(Ord. No. 6996, § 1, 4-16-79) 
Sec. 31-49. - Release of motor vehicle from impoundment. 
(a)  Generally. The owner of an impounded motor vehicle may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment upon requesting such release and presenting proof of ownership to the police department. If the person making the request is the owner or his authorized agent, he shall be given a release to present to the custodian of the place where the vehicle is stored. Nothing in this section shall preclude the owner of the impounded motor vehicle or his agent from paying any towing and storage charges that may be assessed against the motor vehicle, but neither the police nor the custodian of the storage space may require payment of any towing or storage charges as a condition precedent to such release. At the same time as the owner or his agent requests release of the impounded motor vehicle, and if such request is made within forty (40) days after the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, the police shall provide him an opportunity to make a request for a hearing on the propriety of the impoundment and on the amount and his liability for the towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment; provided, that if the owner receives a copy of the notice of impoundment, no hearing may be requested on the impoundment or on the towing and storage charges and the owner shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the impoundment and to the amount of and his liability for the towing and storage charges. 
(b)  Security for payment of charges. If the ownership of the impounded vehicle is evidenced by a title certificate issued by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the owner or his agent may secure the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment without the payment of any towing or storage charges or the deposit of any security for the payment thereof. If the ownership of the impounded motor vehicle is evidenced by a foreign title instrument, or if the jurisdiction in which title is recorded is not evident from the document establishing ownership, the owner or his agent, before the custodian of the place where the motor vehicle is stored authorizes release of the motor vehicle from impoundment, shall deposit with the custodian cash in the amount of the towing and storage charges to the date of the request. If the owner or his agent refuses to provide the cash deposit, the custodian shall not authorize release of the impounded motor vehicle but if the request is timely made, a date shall be set for the hearing on the impoundment and charges. 
(Ord. No. 6996, § 1, 4-16-79) 
Sec. 31-50. - Hearing. 
    If the owner of an impounded motor vehicle or his agent timely requests the release of the motor vehicle from impoundment and a hearing on the impoundment and charges, a date shall be set, not more than five (5) days after the date of request, for the hearing. The city clerk shall provide a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing required by this section. Such person shall be thoroughly familiar with the applicable ordinances of the City of Jacksonville Beach. Although not required to have formal legal training, the person so designated must familiarize himself with the applicable rules governing administrative hearings. Such person should possess the ability to listen attentively to persons giving testimony and be able to exercise mature judgment and tact, and must be able to express himself clearly and concisely, orally, and in writing. At the hearing, the owner, his agent or his attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to present, by oral testimony or documentary evidence, his objections to (a) the impoundment of the motor vehicle and (b)(1) the amount of the towing charges and (2) his liability for the payment thereof. If the owner or his agent requested the hearing more than five (5) days but not more than forty (40) days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment, the owner, his agent or his attorney shall be required at the hearing, as a condition precedent to the presentation of any objections by the owner, to show good cause for the delay in making the request more than five (5) days after the owner received a copy of the notice of impoundment; if good cause cannot be shown, the hearing officer shall dismiss the hearing and make the finding stated in subsection (2) below; otherwise, the hearing examiner shall proceed to hear the owner's objections. At the conclusion of the hearing on the owner's objections, the hearing examiner shall render his decision. If the hearing examiner: 
(1)  Finds that the impoundment was improper, he shall: 
a.  Find that the owner is not liable for any towing or storage charges occasioned by the impoundment; and 
b.  Determine whether and to what extent the city shall bear the expense of the towing and storage charges; or 
(2)  Finds that the impoundment was proper he shall establish: 
a.  The amount of the towing and storage charges to be assessed against the impounded motor vehicle; and 
b.  The extent of the liability of the owner for payment of the towing and storage charges so established.

(Ord. No. 6996, § 1, 4-16-79) 
Sec. 31-51. - Towing and storage charges to constitute lien; limitations. 
    The towing and storage charges occasioned by the impoundment of a motor vehicle shall be and constitute a lien upon the impounded motor vehicle, except as provided in this section. If the hearing examiner finds that the impoundment was improper and if he determines that the city shall bear part or all of the towing and storage charges, the lien created by this section shall be discharged. If the hearing examiner finds that the impoundment was proper but that the towing and storage charges should be in an amount less than the amount of the lien, the lien created by this section shall be discharged to the extent that it exceeds the amount established by the hearing examiner. The holder of a lien created by this section may perfect such lien in any manner provided by law, but he may not retain possession of the motor vehicle when it has been released. In the event that the impounded motor vehicle is released from impoundment and the owner or his agent has provided security for payment of charges as required, the lien created by this section shall also be a lien against the security so provided, subject to being wholly or partially discharged as provided in this section. 
(Ord. No. 6996, § 1, 4-16-79) 
Sec. 31-52. - Satisfaction of lien; notice of public sale. 
    The holder of a lien against a motor vehicle to the extent that such lien has not been discharged as provided or otherwise satisfied, may enforce such lien in any manner provided by law after sixty (60) days from the date of the motor vehicle is impounded. If the owner of the motor vehicle or his agent has provided security for the payment of the lien, the lien shall first be satisfied out of the security so provided and, if any portion of the lien remains unsatisfied and undischarged, may then be enforced in any manner provided by law. If the motor vehicle against which the lien is created is still under impoundment sixty (60) days from the date it is impounded and the owner has not requested release of the motor vehicle from impoundment nor paid the towing and storage charges that are the basis for the lien, the motor vehicle shall be sold at public sale to the highest and best bidder for cash to satisfy the lien. Notice of the sale shall be given in writing to the owner and any person claiming a lien on the motor vehicle shown by the records of the state division of motor vehicles, and by publication one time in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the city, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the sale. This publication may be made before the termination of the sixty-day period for a sale thereafter. If the sale is to be conducted by the city as holder of a lien created, the time and place of the sale shall be fixed by the city clerk, who shall give notice of and conduct the sale in the name and on behalf of the city.

ARTICLE IV. - CRUISING CONTROL 

Sec. 31-76. - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be referred to as the "City of Jacksonville Beach cruising control ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 7560, 4-5-93) 
Sec. 31-77. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply: 
    Congested traffic means traffic on any public street which is delayed to the point that motor vehicles cannot readily move forward on portions of the public street between intersections with other public streets because traffic speed is slowed to less than five miles per hour, where the delay in forward movement is due to the position of other motor vehicles. 
    Cruising means driving a motor vehicle on a designated street past a traffic control point two (2) or more times in any four hour period, following a determination that a state of congested traffic exists and during the time in which the city manager, the police chief or the designee of either, shall have posted a designated street with signs informing the public that the street is subject to regulation under the City of Jacksonville Beach cruising control ordinance, or permitting a motor vehicle to be so operated. The operation of a motor vehicle past a traffic control point the second or subsequent time under the aforesaid conditions, after notice as provided herein, shall constitute unnecessary repetitive driving and therefore a violation of this article. 
    Designated street means any one (1) or more public streets designated as such pursuant to this article; provided, that no portion of a state highway shall be included as a designated street. Any street so designated shall be clearly marked with signs advising the public that the street is subject to regulation under the City of Jacksonville Beach cruising control ordinance. 
    Traffic control point means a clearly identified reference point on a designated street, as deter mined and marked from time to time by the police department. 
(Ord. No. 7560, 4-5-93) 
Sec. 31-78. - Cruising prohibited. 
    No person shall engage in unnecessary repetitive driving, also known as "cruising" as defined in section 31-77, while operating a motor vehicle, and no person shall permit another to engage in cruising while operating a motor vehicle under his or her care, custody and control, after notice as described in section 31-79. 
(Ord. No. 7560, 4-5-93) 
Sec. 31-79. - Notice. 
(a)  Upon observation that a motor vehicle has been operated on a designated street past a traffic control point two (2) or more times following a determination that a state of congested traffic exists and during the time in which the designated street has been posted as provided herein, the vehicle shall be stopped at the time of or after the second or subsequent observation for the purpose of giving notice to the operator and to each passenger in the vehicle. 
    The notice, which may be given orally or in writing, shall inform the operator and passengers that this article is in effect, and that a subsequent operation of the vehicle past a traffic control point within four hours after the initial observation of the vehicle shall constitute a violation of this article. The notice shall include a brief and general description of the designated streets or the area containing the designated streets, and a description of the fine which may be imposed upon conviction. 
(b)  Because the operation of a motor vehicle past a traffic control point after issuance of the notice described herein constitutes the offense of violating section 31-78, a citation shall be issued to the actual operator of the motor vehicle at the time the offense occurs if the operator was the operator or a passenger in the motor vehicle at the time of the issuance of the notice. It shall be immaterial whether the operator at the time the offense occurs actually operated the motor vehicle each time it passed the traffic control point. 
(c)  At the time a motor vehicle is stopped to give the notice described in this section, and at the time a motor vehicle is stopped after the giving of such notice, and prior to issuing a citation to the operator of the motor vehicle, the officer shall afford the operator or a passenger in the motor vehicle an opportunity to explain his or her conduct. No person shall be convicted for violating section 31-78 if it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful purpose, and that the lawful purpose did not constitute unnecessary repetitive driving. Refusal by the person to explain his or her conduct to the officer shall not be deemed an element of the offense or evidence establishing probable cause that the person has violated this section, nor shall such refusal be admissible against the person in a trial of the offense. 
(Ord. No. 7560, 4-5-93) 
Sec. 31-80. - Exclusions. 
    Section 31-78 shall not apply to: 
(1)  Any public service, police, fire, emergency, or other governmental vehicle or any ambulance when operated in official capacity; or 
(2)  Any licensed public transportation vehicle or any vehicle utilized for business or commercial purposes, when operated for such purposes. 
(Ord. No. 7560, 4-5-93) 
Sec. 31-81. - Designation of streets. 
    The city manager, the chief of police, or the ranking police officer on duty in the police department is authorized to designate a public street, other than a state highway, as a designated or "cruising restricted" street upon a determination that a state of congested traffic, as defined in section 31-77, exists. Such designation shall include any portion of the street within which the congested traffic condition is found to exist. Upon the designation of a public street as a designated or "cruising restricted" street, the police department shall post or cause to be posted notices to the public to such effect, and shall establish one (1) or more traffic control points to identify the vehicles being operated upon the designated street. 
(Ord. No. 7560, 4-5-93) 
Sec. 31-82. - Penalty 
    Any person violating section 31-78 shall, upon conviction, be subject to the imposition of a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00).

Sec. 32-34. - Defining and regulating cross-connections and backflow prevention device assemblies, and providing for corrections. 
(a)  "Cross-connection" means any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply is connected, directly or indirectly with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, lawn sprinklers, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixtures, appliances, or other devices which contain or may contain contaminated water, sewage or other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply as the result of backflow. By-pass arrangements, connections, removable sections, swivel or changeable devices and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow could occur are considered to be cross-connections. All primary (potable use) commercial water services require an approved reduced pressure device assembly. All secondary commercial water services (fire suppression, irrigation, etc.) require an approved backflow prevention device. The type of device assembly required for each secondary service is dictated by the service's degree of hazard as determined in the most current edition of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control published by the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research at the University of Southern California. 
(b)  No consumer of water from the city water system shall have a cross-connection or potential cross-connection either inside or outside of any building or buildings without an approved backflow prevention device being installed to prevent any and all backflow. All backflow prevention device assemblies are required to be kept in good working order and be field-testable. All backflow prevention device assemblies shall, as a minimum, be tested annually by a certified tester approved by the city. The owner/consumer is responsible for the testing and all maintenance, and the costs. 
(c)  Only the following are considered to be field-testable, backflow prevention device assemblies and shall be installed in agreement with and under supervision of the director of public works or his/her designated representative: 
(1)  Air gap separation is a physical separation between the free flowing discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure receiving vessel. This gap must be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the rim of the vessel and in no case less than one inch. 
(2)  Reduced pressure device assembly is a device containing within its structure a minimum of two (2) independently acting, approved check valves, with an automatically operating pressure differential relief valve located between the two (2) check valves that will discharge to the atmosphere if the check valves should fail. This unit shall include tightly closing shut-off valves located at each end of the device and each device shall be fitted with properly located test cocks. 
(3)  Atmospheric vacuum breaker is a device operated by atmospheric pressure in combination with the force of gravity. The unit is designed to work on a vertical plane only. The one moving part consists of a poppet valve which must be carefully sized to the slide in a guided chamber and effectively shut off the reverse flow of water when there is a negative pressure. 
(4)  Pressure vacuum breaker is a device similar to an atmospheric vacuum breaker except that the checking unit "poppet valve" is activated by a spring and does not require a negative pressure to react. 
(5)  Double check valve device assembly is an assembly composed of two (2) single, independently acting drip tight check valves, including tightly closing shut-off valves at each end and suitable connections for testing the water tightness of each check valve. 
(d)  The city or its representatives with proper identification may enter at any time inside or outside of any building or buildings for the purpose of checking for cross-connections. If a cross-connection or potential cross-connection is found, the city shall have the right to discontinue water services until the problem has been corrected by elimination or until a proper backflow prevention device has been installed. All backflow prevention devices are subject to periodic inspection by a city representative at city discretion to insure proper operation. 
(e)  These provisions relative to cross-connection have been established for the protection of all the inhabitants of the city and to comply with Chapter 62-555.330 and 62-555.360, Florida Administrative Code or as otherwise provided by law. 
(f)  All water services, plumbing fixtures, and cross-connection control methods shall conform to the cross-connection control standards and procedures as approved by the department of public works.

(g)  Accidental discharges. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. No user who commences contribution to the POTW shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.

Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of the plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city before the user's initiation of the changes. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards will be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request. 
(g)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that the release of the information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets, or secret processes, shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by the city as confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the city until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user.

Sec. 32-98. - Capital contributions. 
    Procedures and standards developed by the director of public works shall define appropriate means by which to optimize development capital contributions in the implementation of basin specific stormwater systems. These basin specific capital contributions shall take the form of the fee-in-lieu-of availability charges. Each situation will be analyzed by the director of public works and a specific written decision will be developed. The application of each is defined as follows: 
(1)  Fee-in-lieu-of is applied to a site specific negotiated procedure, where in a development's stormwater contribution (quantity and quality) is assessed its share of the capital needs of the facilities required to serve the development in question. This capital contribution would be used to implement city-owned stormwater facilities. The process does not apply wherein the stormwater facilities are privately held. Each application is evaluated against the city's master plan for the watershed involved, or while the master plan is incomplete, the cumulative impacts from the development will be evaluated. 
(2)  Availability charge is administered on a site specific basis identical to the fee-in-lieu-of procedure noted above; the only difference is that the capital investment advanced by the city in implementing a stormwater facility is now recovered through an availability charge. The capital charge is determined on a pro-rata share of the capacity used by the new applicant or by the cumulative impact from the development upon all impacted facilities. 
(Ord. No. 7468, § 8, 9-17-90) 
Sec. 32-99. - Program responsibility. 
    It shall be the duty of the director of public works to administer the stormwater utility program.

The city is not required to extend gas mains or service lines that are not adjacent to existing gas mains and service lines. However, if in the opinion of the city manager or his/her designee, the immediate or potential revenues justify the cost of extending the existing gas mains and service lines and the new facilities meet the objectives of the implementation plan for the natural gas utility, the city may extend the gas mains and service lines which may be subject to a contractual period of gas service by the customer. All extensions shall be of the size and type prescribed by the city manager or his/her designee. The city may require a contribution in aid of construction from the customer if the immediate or potential revenues do not totally justify the cost of the facilities as determined by the city manager or his/her designee.

(c)  Installation of service lines and connections. Upon application for connection between a natural gas main and a building to be supplied with natural gas, the entire installation of the natural gas service line and connections from the main to the meter shall be made by the city. Unless approved by the Beaches Energy Services Director, no service line shall be used to supply more than one meter location, nor shall any service line be installed across private property other than the premises of the building to be supplied with natural gas, until customer provides an easement.

(2)  After adoption of the comprehensive plan, the Act, and in particular F.S. § 163.3202(1), mandates that Jacksonville Beach adopt land development regulations that are consistent with and implement the adopted comprehensive plan. 
(3)  F.S. § 163.3194(1)(b), requires that all land development regulations enacted or amended by Jacksonville Beach shall be consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, and any land development regulations existing at the time of adoption which are not consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, shall be amended so as to be consistent.

In the interpretation and application of any provision of the LDC it shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.

(18)  Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists concerning boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official zoning atlas, the following rules shall be used in the interpretation of the zoning district boundaries. 
a.  Center lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, alleys or highways shall be construed as following such center lines.

e.  Shorelines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following shorelines shall be construed as following such shorelines and, in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines. 
f.  Parallel lines. Where boundaries are approximately parallel to a street, highway, road, alley or railroad right-of-way, the distance of such boundaries from the property line of such street, highway, road alley or railroad right-of-way, shall be, unless otherwise shown by dimensions, one lot depth on lots facing said street, highway, road, alley or railroad right-of-way, or approximately one hundred fifty (150) feet, on acreage and tracts or on parallel lots, to the nearest lot line between lots to conform to adjacent district lines.

h.  Uncertainties. Where the physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning atlas, or in case any other uncertainty exists, the planning and development director shall interpret the intent of the official zoning atlas as to the location of boundaries. 
i.  Street abandonments. Where a public road, street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the land to which it reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned road, street, or alley. 
j.  Excluded areas. Where parcels of land and water areas have been inadvertently excluded from a zoning district classification in any manner, said parcels shall be given a classification by the city council that is consistent with the comprehensive plan.

DIVISION 4. - CONDITIONAL USES 

Sec. 34-221. - Purpose. 
    Conditional uses are those uses which are generally not compatible with the other land uses permitted in a zoning district, but with individual review and control of their location, design, configuration and intensity and density of use, buildings and structures, and the imposition of conditions pertinent thereto in order to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location, may be permitted in the zoning district as a conditional use.

Sec. 34-348. - Planned unit development district: PUD. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The application of flexible land use regulations to the development of land is often difficult or impossible within traditional zoning district standards. In order to permit the use of more flexible land use regulations and to facilitate use of the most advantageous techniques of land development, it is often necessary to establish a planned unit development (PUD) zoning district designation in which development is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Code and the comprehensive plan. The objective of a PUD zoning district is to encourage ingenuity, imagination and design efforts on the part of builders, architects, site planners and developers, to produce development which is in keeping with overall land use intensity and open space objectives of this Code and the comprehensive plan, while departing from the strict application of the dimensional standards of the traditional zoning districts. The intent of the PUD zoning district designation is to permit such flexibility and provide performance criteria for PUD which: 
(1)  Permits a creative approach to the development of land; 
(2)  Accomplishes a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of the minimum standards of this Code; 
(3)  Provides for an efficient use of land, resulting in small networks of utilities and streets, thereby lowering development costs; 
(4)  Enhances the appearance of the land through preservation of natural features, the provision of underground utilities, where possible, and the provision of recreation areas and open space in excess of existing standards; 
(5)  Provides an opportunity for new approaches to ownership; 
(6)  Provides an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding areas; and 
(7)  Retains property values. 
(b)  General applicability. Before any development shall be designated planned unit development (PUD) zoning district on the official zoning atlas, it shall receive PUD zoning district approval pursuant to the terms of this section. 
(c)  Initiation of application. An application for a development permit for a PUD zoning district designation may only be submitted by the owner, or any person having a contractual interest and unified control of the land, or their authorized agent. 
(d)  General overview. Prior to receipt of a planned unit development (PUD) zoning district classification, land must receive approval of a preliminary development plan for PUD pursuant to the procedures and standards of this section. The preliminary development plan for a PUD zoning district classification must then receive approval of a development plan pursuant to the procedures and standards of section 34-251 et seq. 
(e)  Preapplication conference.

Sec. 34-380. - Payment in lieu of off-street parking. 
(a)  Purpose. In lieu parking contributions are hereby authorized by the establishment of a fee to be paid to the City of Jacksonville Beach. Said fee is a required condition of approval for relief from the off-street parking requirements set forth in section 34-377 of this chapter for properties located within the central business district: CBD or a redevelopment district: RD. Such payments will allow the City of Jacksonville Beach to acquire land, finance, design, construct, and carry out maintenance and repairs to public parking facilities; and to perform other necessary and desirable actions to provide public off-street parking facilities. 
(b)  General provisions. 
(1)  In lieu of providing the parking spaces required by this chapter, the owner of a building or use requiring off-street parking spaces shall, upon approval by the director of planning and development of an application for relief from said requirements, pay to the City of Jacksonville Beach the established amount per parking space that is not to be provided. 
(2)  The amount per space shall be established by resolution of the city council. The amount per space to be paid in lieu of providing required off-street parking shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the city council. Factors to be considered by the city council when establishing the amount of the funds to be contributed per "in lieu" space are: 
a.  The cost of land; 
b.  The amount of land needed for each parking space along with driveway aisles, landscaped areas, and other amenities; 
c.  The cost of physical improvements to the property including grading, compaction, drainage, asphalt, concrete, landscaping, lighting, striping and other amenities as may be considered appropriate. 
(3)  In the event that the director of planning and development approves an application for relief from an off-street parking requirement for all or a portion of the required number of parking spaces in the central business district: CBD or redevelopment district: RD, such relief shall be granted only upon the condition that the applicant make payment to the City of Jacksonville Beach in accordance with the provisions of this section for the number of spaces waived. 
(4)  Any off-street parking requirement met in this manner shall not require the payment of an additional fee, unless a change in use of the land generates an additional parking requirement. In such case, the applicant may choose to provide the additional required off-street parking or provide in lieu payment for the required additional parking. 
(5)  All funds received in lieu of parking spaces shall be placed in a separate parking improvement fund to be used solely to acquire land, finance, design, construct, and carry out maintenance and repairs to public parking facilities; and to perform other necessary and desirable actions to provide public off-street parking facilities. Payment of such funds does not guarantee the construction of any spaces in a particular area of the central business district or within any particular period of time. In-lieu parking payments are solely an alternative means of satisfying the applicant's obligation to provide off-street parking in accordance with this division. Funds paid to the city as a fee in lieu of parking shall not be refundable for any reason. 
(6)  Payment of in lieu fees must be made to the city at the time of issuance of the applicable building permit, or within six (6) months of the approval of the in lieu payment, whichever comes first. 
(7)  Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the city to undertake the acquisition, construction, expansion, or development of any particular off-street parking facility.

(2)  Oceanfront areas. Oceanfront residences shall comply with the tree planting and preservation requirements of section 34-425(a)(1). Salt tolerant landscaping and trees shall be used. 
(3)  Nonresidential lot. One (1) tree shall be planted or preserved for every six thousand (6,000) square feet of a nonresidential lot or fraction thereof. Fifty (50) percent of all trees required to be planted or preserved in nonresidential zoning districts shall be shade trees. Pervious landscaped area shall be maintained in all zoning districts in accordance with the minimum requirements for the zoning district. In those zoning districts where it is required, the front and corner side yard setbacks shall include a ten-foot landscaped strip. The hedge requirement in the ten-foot landscaped strip is optional unless the ten (10) foot strip separates a parking area from a public right-of-way, in which case, the hedge is mandatory. 
(b)  Off-street parking and vehicular use area landscape buffers. 
(1)  Landscape buffers adjacent to public rights-of-way. A landscaped area at least five (5) feet in width shall be located between off-street parking areas and abutting rights-of-way. Wheel stops or curbing shall be used to assure that this five (5) foot strip is not overhung by car bumpers. This landscaped area shall include one (1) shade tree for every twenty-five (25) linear feet of frontage. In addition, a hedge of at least two (2) feet in height upon planting shall be placed along the parking lot side of the landscaped strip. If a barrier of non-living materials is used in-lieu of a hedge to satisfy the landscape buffer requirements of section 34-425(d)(1), such barrier shall not exceed four (4) feet in height. One (1) shrub or vine for every four (4) linear feet of barrier shall be planted abutting all barriers. Required shrubs or vines may be clustered rather than spaced evenly. Required shrubs or vines shall be planted along the street side of such barrier within the required landscape buffer. The remainder of the required landscape buffer shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, or other landscape treatment. Turf grasses shall not comprise more than forty (40) percent of the pervious area. 
(2)  Landscape buffers adjacent to residential uses. When multifamily or nonresidential off-street parking areas or other vehicular use areas abut single-family residential uses or properties, that portion of such area not entirely screened by an intervening structure shall be separated by a landscaped buffer at least seven (7) feet in width. The landscape buffer shall contain an opaque screen composed of either living plant materials or durable non-living materials, such as fences or walls. Required screens or barriers shall have a minimum height of six (6) feet and shall be located on the parking lot side of the landscape buffer. When located on side lot lines, such screen shall be reduced to four (4) feet in height within ten (10) feet of its intersection within the street right-of-way line. 
a.  Visual barriers. All living plant materials within landscape buffers adjacent to residential uses shall be planted in a manner which will form a visual barrier with a minimum height of at least thirty (30) inches upon planting. Such barriers shall attain the required height of six (6) feet within twenty-four (24) months under normal growing conditions. A barrier shall be accented with one (1) shrub or vine for every five (5) linear feet of barrier and shall be planted on the residential side of the barrier. 
b.  Trees. A minimum of one (1) tree shall be planted for every twenty-five (25) linear feet of landscape buffer adjacent to a residential use. Each such tree shall be planted in at least twenty-five (25) square feet of planting area with a minimum dimension of at least five (5) feet. Grouping of trees in larger, naturally landscaped islands is encouraged. 
(3)  Screening of dumpster/solid waste container areas. All solid waste containers, including, but not limited to, compactors and dumpsters, shall be located and designed so as not to be visible from the view of adjacent streets and properties. If screening is required to eliminate the visibility of a container from adjacent streets and properties, then the type of screening used shall be determined based on the proposed location of the solid waste container, existing site conditions, and the type and amount of existing vegetation on the site. All solid waste containers shall meet the following standards: 
a.  All solid waste containers shall be enclosed so as not to be seen off-site and shall be enclosed with solid gate(s) to contain windblown litter. 
b.  The enclosure shall be at least two (2) feet taller than the highest point of the trash containment device. 
c.  The enclosure shall be made of a material that is opaque at time of installation and compatible with design of the principal building. The preferable material is masonry with solid metal gate(s); however, wood and other similar material may be used provided that interior bollards are installed to protect the enclosure from damage caused by unloading the solid waste container. 
d.  All solid waste containers shall be placed on a concrete pad large enough to provide for both adequate support and positive drainage. 
e.  The enclosure shall contain gate(s) to allow for access and security. Gates must be maintained in good working order. 
(c)  Interior landscaping of parking and vehicular use areas. Off-street parking and vehicular use areas containing more than ten (10) parking spaces or more than two thousand (2,000) square feet of surface area shall provide pervious interior landscape area equal to at least ten (10) percent of the total paved area. 
(1)  Landscape islands. Each separate interior landscaped area shall contain a minimum of one hundred (100) square feet of area and shall be at least five (5) feet in width. A minimum of one (1) shade tree shall be planted for every one hundred (100) square feet of interior landscaping. The remainder of the required landscape area shall be planted with shrubs, ground cover or other approved tree and landscape materials. 
(2)  Curbing and wheel stops. All interior landscaping shall be protected from vehicle encroachment by curbing or wheel stops. 
(3)  Location of landscape areas. Interior landscape areas shall be located in a manner which will divide or interrupt the broad expanse of paving within parking and vehicular use areas. Landscaped areas shall subdivide parking areas into parking bays containing a maximum of twenty (20) spaces, provided that no more than ten (10) spaces shall be in an uninterrupted row. 
(4)  Modification of interior landscape requirements. In vehicular use areas where the strict application of this subsection would seriously limit the function of said area, the required landscaping may be located near the perimeter of the paved area. Such required interior landscaping which is relocated shall be in addition to the perimeter landscaping requirements. 
(d)  Compatibility landscape buffers. 
(1)  Applicability. A compatibility landscape buffer shall be required to be installed in the following areas. 
a.  Protection of single-family uses. A compatibility landscape buffer shall be installed adjacent to the property line of a multifamily, commercial or industrial site where the property line abuts an RS-1, RS-2 or RS-3 zoning district or a developed single-family or two-family land use and such zoning districts or land uses are not separated by an intervening street or alley. 
b.  Screening of junkyards and outdoor theaters. A compatibility landscape buffer shall be installed adjacent to the property line of a junkyard or outdoor theater site where the property line abuts a residential zoning district or land use and such zoning districts or land uses are not separated by an intervening street or alley, and along the street frontage of a junkyard or outdoor theater site. 
(2)  Compatibility buffer standards. A compatibility landscape buffer shall consist of a landscape buffer strip with a minimum width of seven (7) feet, and an opaque screen with a minimum height of six (6) feet shall be installed within the landscape buffer area to create a visual barrier. 
a.  Hedges and living barriers. If a hedge is planted as a screen, plantings shall be of a size and type which will ensure complete visual screening for a height of six (6) feet within twenty-four (24) months of the date of planting. 
b.  Non-living barriers. If a non-living barrier is used to satisfy the screening requirements of this subsection, a minimum of one (1) shrub or vine shall be installed for every five (5) linear feet of barrier and shall be planted on the residential or street side of the barrier.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-8065, § 1, adopted Dec. 7, 2015 , repealed the former Div. 4, §§ 34-441-34-457. Section 2 of said ordinance enacted a new Div. 4 as set out herein. The former Div. 4 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2010-7991, § 2, adopted Sept. 7, 2010. 

Sec. 34-441. - Purpose, intent and scope. 
    It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety and general welfare through reasonable, consistent and non-discriminatory sign standards. The sign regulations in this division are also designed and intended to meet the statutory requirement that this municipality adopt land development regulations that regulate signage, a requirement set forth in F.S. § 163.3202(f). The sign regulations in this division are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate the adverse secondary effects of signs. The sign regulations are especially intended to address the secondary effects that may adversely impact aesthetics and safety. The sign regulations are designed to serve substantial governmental interests and, in some cases, compelling governmental interests such as traffic safety and warning signs of threats to bodily injury or death. 
    This division regulates signs, as defined in this Land Development Code, which are placed on private property or on property owned by public agencies including the city and over which the city has zoning authority. This division is not intended to extend its regulatory regime to objects that are not traditionally considered signs for purpose of government regulation. 
    The city of Jacksonville Beach is primarily a single family residential and small resort community on the east coast of Florida. The eastern boundary of the city is the Atlantic Ocean and the western boundary is the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (Pablo Creek). The economic base of the city is heavily dependent on visitors from the Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia area, as well as other areas of the United States. In order to preserve and promote the city as a desirable community in which to live, vacation and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive environment is of foremost importance. The regulation of signs within the city is a highly contributive means by which to achieve this desired end. 
    These sign regulations have been prepared with the intent of enhancing the visual environment of the city and promoting its continued well-being, and are intended to: 
(1)  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city; 
(2)  Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
(3)  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
(4)  Minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; 
(5)  Foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; 
(6)  Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive size (area) of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
(7)  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; 
(8)  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located; 
(9)  Establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; 
(10)  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site and adjoining sites; 
(11)  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
(12)  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs; 
(13)  Preserve, conserve, protect, and enhance the aesthetic quality and scenic beauty of all districts of the city; 
(14)  Allow for traffic control devices consistent with national standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways, and that notify road users of regulations and provide warning and guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream; 
(15)  Protect property values by precluding, to the maximum extent possible, sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or movement; 
(16)  Protect property values by ensuring that sign types, as well as the number of signs, are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and conforming signs in the area; 
(17)  Regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the beautification of the city and that complements the natural surroundings in recognition of this city's reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts in retaining economic advantage for its resort community, as well as for its major subdivisions, shopping centers and industrial parks; 
(18)  Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations; 
(19)  Promote the use of signs that positively contribute to the aesthetics of the community, are appropriate in scale to the surrounding buildings and landscape, and advance the city's goals of quality development; 
(20)  Provide standards regarding the non-communicative aspects of signs, which are consistent with city, county, state and federal law; 
(21)  Provide flexibility and encourage variety in signage, and create an incentive to relate signage to the basic principles of good design; and 
(22)  Assure that the benefits derived from the expenditure of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets, sidewalks, public parks, public rights-of-way, and other public places and spaces, are protected by exercising reasonable controls over the physical characteristics and structural design of signs.

( Ord. No. 2015-8065, § 2(Exh. A), 12-7-15 ) 
Sec. 34-445. - General provisions for signs. 
    The following general sign provisions shall apply to this division and to all lawful conforming and nonconforming signs, unless otherwise indicated. 
(1)  Measurement of sign size (sign area). The area of a sign is measured or calculated as follows: 
a.  Background panel signs. Sign copy that is mounted, affixed, or painted on a background panel or area distinctively painted, textured or constructed as a background for the sign copy, is measured as that area contained within the sum of the smallest rectangles, squares, triangles, parallelograms, circles or ellipses that will enclose both the sign copy and the background. 
b.  Background surface signs. The area of a sign consisting of copy mounted as individual letters or graphics against a wall, fascia, or parapet of a building surface or another surface, that has not been painted, textured, or otherwise altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, is measured as the sum of the smallest rectangles, squares, triangles, parallelograms, circles or ellipses that will enclose each word, graphic or discrete visual element in the total sign. 
c.  Illuminated background signs. The area of a sign with copy mounted, affixed, or painted on an illuminated surface or illuminated element or a building or structure, is measured as the entire illuminated surface or illuminated element which contains sign copy. 
d.  Double-faced signs. If a sign has two display faces, and the interior angle between the two faces is thirty (30) degrees or less, then the sign area is one sign face only; however, if the two faces are of different sizes or shapes, then the larger is used. If the sign has two display faces, and the interior angle between the two faces is greater than thirty (30) degrees, then the sign area is the sum of the areas of the two faces. 
e.  Multi-faced signs. If a sign has three or more faces, then the sign area is equal to fifty (50) percent of the aggregate area of all sign faces. The area of each face shall be determined according to subsection (a) or (b) of this section, as applicable. 
f.  Sculptural and nonplanar signs. The area of a spherical, free form, sculptural or other nonplanar sign is fifty (50) percent of the sum of the areas, using only the four vertical sides of the smallest four-sided polyhedron which will completely enclose the entire sign structure. 
(2)  Measurement of sign height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as the vertical distance from the average finished grade of the ground below the sign excluding any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purposes of increasing the height of the sign, to the top edge of the highest portion of the sign. The maximum height allowed for a freestanding sign, however, shall not include any architectural embellishment provided the embellishment does not exceed thirty-six (36) inches at the base of the sign and eighteen (18) inches at the top of the sign. 
For the purposes of this section, average finished grade shall be considered the lower of (a) the lowest elevation where the base of the sign meets ground level; or (b) the top of the curb of the nearest public street adjoining the property upon which the sign is erected, or (c) the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the lot on which the sign is located. 
(3)  Sign illumination for temporary signs and permanent signs. 
a.  Sign illumination is prohibited for temporary signs. 
b.  Permanent sign on a parcel in residential use. A permanent sign located on a parcel in residential use in any zone may not be separately or specially illuminated, unless otherwise specified in this division. 
c.  Permanent sign on a parcel in nonresidential use. A permanent sign on a parcel in nonresidential use may be illuminated by internal illumination, internal indirect (halo) illumination, or lit by external indirect illumination, unless otherwise specified in this division. However, a permanent sign may not be illuminated in a manner that leaves the illumination device exposed to public view except with the use of neon tubing as provided in subsection (h) of this section. 
d.  Internal illumination. Outdoor internally illuminated signs, including but not limited to awning/canopy signs, cabinet signs (whether freestanding or building mounted), changeable copy panels or service island signs, shall be constructed with an opaque background and translucent letters or other graphical elements, or with a colored background and lighter letters or graphics. 
e.  External indirect illumination. Externally lit signs are permitted to be illuminated only with steady, stationary, down directed and shielded light sources directed solely onto the sign. Light bulbs or tubes (excluding neon), used for illuminating a sign, shall not be visible from the adjacent public rights-of-way or residential properties. 
f.  Illumination of signs adjacent to single-family residential uses. No sign located within fifty (50) feet of a property with a single-family use or zoned for a single-family use shall be internally illuminated. 
g.  Any portion of the sign face or sign structure that is illuminated shall count against the total square footage of allowable sign area. 
h.  Neon. 
(i)  Exposed neon. Exposed neon tube illumination is not permitted in residential zones, or for residential uses in any zone. It is allowed in all other places, unless otherwise specified. 
(ii)  Neon borders. Neon illumination used as a sign copy projection, border, frame or other embellishment of sign copy shall not be included in the total size or area of the sign, provided the measured area of any such projection or detailed embellishment does not exceed twelve (12) square feet in area, or twenty-five (25) percent of the sign display face area, whichever is greater. If neon embellishments exceed these limits, then the embellishments shall be included and counted as part of the permitted sign area for the use. 
(4)  Viewpoint neutrality. Notwithstanding anything in this division to the contrary, no sign or sign structure shall be subject to any limitation based upon the viewpoint of the message contained on such sign or displayed on such sign structure. 
(5)  Substitution of noncommercial speech for commercial speech. Notwithstanding anything contained in this division to the contrary, any sign erected pursuant to the provisions of this division may, at the option of the owner, contain a non-commercial message in lieu of a commercial message and the noncommercial copy may be substituted at any time in place of the commercial copy. The noncommercial message (copy) may occupy the entire sign face or any portion thereof. The sign face may be changed from a commercial message to a noncommercial message or from one noncommercial message to another non-commercial message; provided, however, that there is no change in the size, height, setback or spacing criteria contained in this division. 
(6)  Consent of legal owner of property. No sign may be displayed without the consent of the legal owner of the property on which the sign is mounted or displayed. For purposes of this policy, "owner" means the holder of the legal title to the property and any party and person holding a present legal right to possession, control, or use of the property. 
(7)  Signs on public property. Any sign installed or placed on public property, except in conformance with the requirements of this division, shall be deemed illegal and shall be forfeited to the public and subject to confiscation. In addition to other remedies hereunder, the city shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such sign the cost of removal and disposal of such sign. The foregoing shall not apply to temporary A-frame signs and T-frame signs as allowed pursuant to the conditions and limitations set forth herein. 
(8)  Signs that obstruct means of egress. No sign shall be erected so as to obstruct any fire escape, required exit, window, or door opening intended as a means of egress.

d.  All decisions shall be mailed, transmitted electronically, or hand delivered to the applicant. A record shall be kept of the date of mailing, electronic transmittal, or hand delivery. For the purposes of calculating compliance with the thirty (30) day deadline for a decision upon an application or the fourteen (14) day deadline for a decision upon request for reconsideration, the decision shall be deemed made when deposited in the mail, transmitted electronically, or hand delivered to the applicant.

1.  In any case in which the application requires a rezoning of the property, or an amendment to the comprehensive plan of the city, then upon written request of the applicant delivered to the director of planning and development by certified mail before the applicable deadline, the time shall be suspended until a final decision is made upon the application for the variance, rezoning, or comprehensive plan amendment. 
2.  If the applicant is required to make any change to the application in order to obtain an unconditional approval so as to satisfy an express provision of state law, the LDC, or the City of Jacksonville Beach Code of Ordinances, then upon the written request of the applicant delivered by certified mail to the director of planning and development before the applicable deadline, the time shall be suspended while the applicant makes such change. 
3.  If an applicant is required by state statute or by any express provision of either the LDC or the City of Jacksonville Beach Code of Ordinances, to obtain an approval of the sign from any other governmental agency within the limitations set forth in F.S. § 166.033(4), then upon the request of the applicant in writing delivered by certified mail before the applicable deadline, the time shall be suspended. The time shall remain suspended until such approval is obtained or until the applicant requests in writing delivered by certified mail to the director of planning and development that the city take final action. The city shall comply with the provisions of F.S. § 166.033(4). 
4.  In any of the foregoing cases, the applicant may elect to not make any changes to the application or to not obtain an approval that may be required by another governmental agency, and may instead demand in writing a final decision upon the sign permit application as filed. Such a written demand shall be delivered by certified mail to the director of planning and development. In such event, the director of planning and development shall make a decision on the application as appropriate within thirty (30) business days after receiving such demand. If a decision is not made in such a time, the application shall be deemed denied. 
f.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the director of planning and development upon a sign permit application, or aggrieved by any failure by the director of planning and development or by any other city official to act upon a sign permit application in accordance with the LDC, shall have the right to seek judicial review by the Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit in and for Duval County, Florida, or by any other court of competent jurisdiction, filed in accordance with the requirements of law, seeking such appropriate remedy as may be available.

If an applicant believes that his or her speech rights are being denied due to enforcement of subsection (8)c. or (8)e., above, he or she may immediately contact the planning and development department director, in writing via certified letter, and request immediate review of any pending sign permit application. If such a letter is received by the planning and development department director, the city shall have twenty (20) days to review the permit application as under subsection (8)a., above, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (8)c or (8)e., above. If the planning and development department director does not respond to the applicant following receipt of the certified letter, the substance of the applicant's complaint shall be deemed rejected. 
h.  If an application is deemed incomplete, the applicant may either take steps to submit a complete application or challenge the City's decision by seeking judicial review by the Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial Circuit in and for Duval County, or by any other court of competent jurisdiction, filed in accordance with the requirements of law, seeking such appropriate remedy as may be available.

Sec. 34-450. - Nonconforming signs. 
    All signs that are lawfully in existence or are lawfully erected and that do not conform to the provisions of this division are declared nonconforming signs. It is the intent of this division to recognize that the eventual elimination of nonconforming signs as expeditiously and fairly as possible is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs that would violate the provisions of this division. It is also the intent of this division that any elimination of nonconforming signs shall be effected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established property rights. 
(1)  Legal nonconforming signs: 
a.  A legal nonconforming sign is a sign that lawfully existed at the time of the enactment of this division that does not conform to the regulations as specified in this division. 
b.  A legal nonconforming sign may continue to be utilized only in the manner and to the extent that it existed at the time of the adoption of this division or any amendment thereof. 
c.  A legal nonconforming sign may not be altered in any manner not in conformance with this division. This does not apply to reasonable repair and maintenance of the sign or to a change of copy provided that by changing the copy structural alterations are not required. 
d.  Any building permit for an addition, alteration, or improvement valued at more than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the structure or building for work at locations where any nonconforming sign exists shall specify and require that such nonconforming signs located within the boundaries of the development site, and within the limits of the applicant's control, shall be brought into conformance with the provisions of this division, provided that if the nonconforming sign is a type of sign that is prohibited under section 34-444, prohibited signs in all zoning districts, it shall be removed. 
e.  Legal nonconforming signs that are located on a parcel of property that is severed from a larger parcel of property and acquired by a public entity for public use by condemnation, purchase or dedication may be relocated on the remaining parcel without extinguishing the legal nonconforming status of that sign provided that the nonconforming sign: 
1.  Is not increased in area or height to exceed the limits of the zoning district in which it is located; 
2.  Remains structurally unchanged except for reasonable repairs or alterations; 
3.  Is placed in the most similar position on the remaining property that it occupied prior to the relocation; and 
4.  Is relocated in a manner so as to comply with all applicable safety requirements. 
After relocation pursuant to this subsection, the legal nonconforming sign shall be subject to all provisions of this section in its new location. 
(2)  Signs rendered nonconforming: 
a.  Except as provided in this section, a nonconforming sign may continue in the manner and to the extent that it existed at the time of the adoption, amendment or annexation of the division that rendered the sign nonconforming. This section shall not prohibit reasonable repairs and alterations to nonconforming signs. 
b.  A nonconforming sign shall not be re-erected, relocated or replaced unless it is brought into compliance with the requirements of this division. An existing monument sign that conforms to the size and height limitations set forth herein, but is otherwise nonconforming, may be relocated a single time to another location on the same parcel. 
c.  Any nonconforming sign shall be removed or rebuilt in full conformity to the terms of this division if it is damaged or allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the cost of repair or restoration is fifty (50) percent or more of the cost of replacement of such sign. 
(3)  Signs for a legal nonconforming use: 
a.  New or additional signs for a nonconforming use shall not be permitted. 
b.  A nonconforming sign for a nonconforming use that ceases to be used for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days or is replaced by a conforming use, shall be considered a prohibited sign and shall be removed or brought into conformance upon establishment of a conforming use. 
(4)  Signs discontinued: 
a.  Sign structures that remain vacant, unoccupied or devoid of any message, or display a message pertaining to a time, event or purpose that no longer applies, for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days, shall be deemed to be discontinued. 
b.  A nonconforming sign deemed discontinued shall immediately terminate the right to maintain such sign. 
c.  After a sign structure has been deemed discontinued, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner or the property owner's authorized agent to remove the discontinued sign and to patch and conceal any and all damage to any other structure resulting from removal of the sign. 
d.  Removal of a discontinued nonconforming sign shall include all sign support components, angle irons, poles, and other remnants of the discontinued sign, that are not currently in use, or proposed for immediate reuse as evidenced by a sign permit application for a permitted sign. 
(5)  Unsafe signs: 
a.  If the building official determines any sign or sign structure to be in an unsafe condition, he/she shall immediately notify, in writing, the owner of such sign who shall correct such condition within forty-eight (48) hours. 
b.  If the correction has not been made within forty-eight (48) hours, the building official may have the sign removed if it creates a danger to the public safety or have any necessary repairs or maintenance performed at the expense of the sign owner or owner or lessee of the property upon which the sign is located.

( Ord. No. 2015-8065, § 2(Exh. A), 12-7-15 ) 
Sec. 34-453. - Severability. 
(1)  Generally. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division. 
(2)  Severability where less speech results. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in subsection (1), above, or elsewhere in this division, the Jacksonville Beach Code of Ordinances, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division, even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise. 
(3)  Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth above in subsection (1), above, or elsewhere in this division, the Jacksonville Beach Code of Ordinance, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division or any other law is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division that pertains to prohibited signs, including specifically those signs and sign types prohibited and not allowed under section 34-444, prohibited signs, of this division. Furthermore, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 34-444 is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of section 34-444 thereby ensuring that as many prohibited sign types as may be constitutionally prohibited continue to be prohibited. 
(4)  Severability of prohibition on billboards. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this division and/or any other Code provisions and/or laws are declared invalid or unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect the prohibition on billboards as contained in this Division or in the Jacksonville Beach Code of Ordinances.

DIVISION 5. - ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS 

Sec. 34-466. - Stormwater management. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this division is to manage stormwater drainage within of the City of Jacksonville Beach in order to maintain and enhance the public health, safety, and welfare through the control of runoff volume and treatment of stormwater runoff for the protection of surface water and groundwater quality, and the control and prevention of erosion, sedimentation, and flooding by providing standards for the design, construction, and operation of stormwater management systems in conformance with best overall management practices. 
    This division is intended to implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the comprehensive plan of the City of Jacksonville Beach, and to be consistent with the applicable policies and regulations of regional, state and federal agencies regarding stormwater management. It is also intended to allow landowners reasonable use of their property while promoting the following objectives: 
(1)  Protecting the quality and quantity of ground and surface waters. 
(2)  Perpetuating recharge of the groundwater system; 
(3)  Reducing erosion loss of topsoil and subsequent sedimentation of surface water bodies. 
(4)  Preventing loss of life and property damage due to runoff from any foreseeable rainfall event. 
(b)  Applicability. This division shall apply within the incorporated area of the City of Jacksonville Beach, Florida. A permit will be required only for new stormwater discharge facilities as defined herein. This provision shall not effect the city's authority to require corrective action whenever a stormwater management facility causes or contributes to violations of water quality and flood control standards. 
(c)  Procedures. 
(1)  No person may subdivide land, initiate construction activity, make any substantial change in land contour lines, alter drainage or stormwater runoff, or construct a stormwater management system without first satisfying the requirements contained in this division and applicable regional, state and federal regulations, and obtaining approval from the public works director. The following activities may potentially alter or disrupt existing stormwater runoff patterns, and as such, will, unless exempt pursuant to section 34-466(e), require a permit prior to initiation of any development. 
a.  Clearing and/or draining of land for development purposes; 
b.  Clearing and/or draining of nonagricultural land; 
c.  Converting undeveloped lands to nonagricultural uses; 
d.  Subdivision of land where road improvements are required; 
e.  Alteration of land and/or the construction of a structure or a change in the size of one (1) or more structures. 
(2)  Development plans submitted for approval shall show all areas retained in a pervious condition and their past development treatment. All structured drainage shall be shown in sufficient detail to enable a determination to be made of their holding capacity and all pipe runs shall be shown with details concerning material direction of slope (degree of fall) and point of connection to off-site drainage systems. Capacity and/or throughput potential must meet the requirements of section 34-466(e)(1)a. through d. 
(3)  The planning and development director will certify compliance with these provisions upon receipt of approval by the public works director. 
(4)  No connection shall be made to off-site drainage systems until approval has been received from the owner of the system (either city, county, or state government). 
(d)  Exemptions. The following development shall be exempt from the terms of this division. 
(1)  The construction, replacement, alteration, or maintenance of a single-family or two-family residence and accessory structures, where clearing and drainage does not adversely impact adjacent properties by diverting runoff. 
(2)  The clearing of land which is to be used solely for conservation, recreation, agriculture, or open space provided no disruption of natural surface waters or impoundment of surface water will result. This exemption will not apply where clearing and drainage may directly or indirectly impact areas defined as conservation/protected areas pursuant to the comprehensive plan. 
(e)  Standards for stormwater management. 
(1)  General. 
a.  The general design and performance requirements of this division shall meet all of the standards of the following documents, unless stricter standards are stated herein. These documents are incorporated herein as part of the LDC by reference:

3.  Chapter 40C, Rules of the St. Johns River Water Management District. 
4.  National Pollution Discharge System rules of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
b.  Innovative approaches to stormwater management shall be encouraged and the concurrent control of erosion, sedimentation and flooding shall be mandatory. The public works director reserves authority in approving alternate methods of meeting the objectives of these guidelines and regulations on a demonstration by the applicant that similar results can be achieved by the proposed alternate method. 
c.  All stormwater management systems constructed or reconstructed under development orders issued by Jacksonville Beach authorities shall be in accordance with the following:

6.  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
7.  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
8.  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
9.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
10.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
h.  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
1.  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this ordinance or the required elevation standards; 
2.  Determination by the Jacksonville Beach Board of Adjustment that: 
(a)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
(b)  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
(c)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
3.  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
4.

(a)  Be located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(b)  Meet the limitations of section 34-467(a)(10)c.1.(f) of this ordinance if located in a regulated floodway; 
(c)  Be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement resulting from hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the design flood; 
(d)  Be constructed of flood damage-resistant materials; and 
(e)  Have mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems above the design flood elevation, except that minimum electric service required to address life safety and electric code requirements is permitted below the design flood elevation provided it conforms to the provisions of the electrical part of building code for wet locations. 
2.  Fences in regulated floodways. Fences in regulated floodways that have the potential to block the passage of floodwaters, such as stockade fences and wire mesh fences, shall meet the limitations of section 34-467(a)(10)c.1.(f) of this ordinance. 
3.  Retaining walls, sidewalks, and driveways in regulated floodways. Retaining walls and sidewalks and driveways that involve the placement of fill in regulated floodways shall meet the limitations of section 34-467(a)(10)c.1.(f) of this ordinance. 
4.  Roads and watercourse crossings in regulated floodways. Roads and watercourse crossings, including roads, bridges, culverts, low-water crossings and similar means for vehicles or pedestrians to travel from one side of a watercourse to the other side, that encroach into regulated floodways shall meet the limitations of section 34-467(a)(10)c.1.(f) of this ordinance. Alteration of a watercourse that is part of a road or watercourse crossing shall meet the requirements of section 34-467(a)(5)c.3 of this ordinance. 
5.  Concrete slabs used as parking pads, enclosure floors, landings, decks, walkways, patios, and similar nonstructural uses in coastal high hazard areas (Zone V). In coastal high hazard areas, concrete slabs used as parking pads, enclosure floors, landings, decks, walkways, patios and similar nonstructural uses are permitted beneath or adjacent to buildings and structures provided the concrete slabs are designed and constructed to be: 
(a)  Structurally independent of the foundation system of the building or structure; 
(b)  Frangible and not reinforced, so as to minimize debris during flooding that is capable of causing significant damage to any structure; and 
(c)  Have a maximum slab thickness of not more than four (4) inches. 
6.  Decks and patios in coastal high hazard areas (Zone V). In addition to the requirements of the Florida Building Code, in coastal high hazard areas decks and patios shall be located, designed, and constructed in compliance with the following: 
(a)  A deck that is structurally attached to a building or structure shall have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member at or above the design flood elevation and any supporting members that extend below the design flood elevation shall comply with the foundation requirements that apply to the building or structure, which shall be designed to accommodate any increased loads resulting from the attached deck. 
(b)  A deck or patio that is located below the design flood elevation shall be structurally independent from buildings or structures and their foundation systems, and shall be designed and constructed either to remain intact and in place during design flood conditions or to break apart into small pieces to minimize debris during flooding that is capable of causing structural damage to the building or structure or to adjacent buildings and structures. 
(c)  A deck or patio that has a vertical thickness of more than twelve (12) inches or that is constructed with more than the minimum amount of fill necessary for site drainage shall not be approved unless an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave run-up and wave reflection that would increase damage to the building or structure or to adjacent buildings and structures. 
(d)  A deck or patio that has a vertical thickness of twelve (12) inches or less and that is at natural grade or on nonstructural fill material that is similar to and compatible with local soils and is the minimum amount necessary for site drainage may be approved without requiring analysis of the impact on diversion of floodwaters or wave run-up and wave reflection. 
7.  Other development in coastal high hazard areas (Zone V). In coastal high hazard areas, development activities other than buildings and structures shall be permitted only if also authorized by the appropriate federal, state or local authority; if located outside the footprint of, and not structurally attached to, buildings and structures; and if analyses prepared by qualified registered design professionals demonstrate no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave run-up and wave reflection that would increase damage to adjacent buildings and structures. Such other development activities include but are not limited to: 
(a)  Bulkheads, seawalls, retaining walls, revetments, and similar erosion control structures; 
(b)  Solid fences and privacy walls, and fences prone to trapping debris, unless designed and constructed to fail under flood conditions less than the design flood or otherwise function to avoid obstruction of floodwaters; and 
(c)  On-site sewage treatment and disposal systems defined in 64E-6.002, F.A.C., as filled systems or mound systems. 
8.  Nonstructural fill in coastal high hazard areas (Zone V). In coastal high hazard areas: 
(a)  Minor grading and the placement of minor quantities of nonstructural fill shall be permitted for landscaping and for drainage purposes under and around buildings. 
(b)  Nonstructural fill with finished slopes that are steeper than one unit vertical to five units horizontal shall be permitted only if an analysis prepared by a qualified registered design professional demonstrates no harmful diversion of floodwaters or wave run up and wave reflection that would increase damage to adjacent buildings and structures. 
(c)  Where authorized by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection or applicable local approval, sand dune construction and restoration of sand dunes under or around elevated buildings are permitted without additional engineering analysis or certification of the diversion of floodwater or wave run up and wave reflection if the scale and location of the dune work is consistent with local beach-dune morphology and the vertical clearance is maintained between the top of the sand dune and the lowest horizontal structural member of the building.

(5)  Nonresidential use of regulated substances. If a nonresidential building proposes to contain, use, handle or store regulated substances and is located partially within a protection zone, then the entire building shall be governed by the restrictions applicable to that zone or to the more restrictive zone. 
(6)  Negative water supply impacts. No development shall be approved that negatively impacts the water resources of adjoining property owners, wetlands or lakes. Impacts shall include potential supply limitations by excessive drawdown, salt-water contamination or other quality problems. 
(f)  Restrictions on issuance of permits and licenses for new activities. 
(1)  Every application for a development permit shall indicate whether or not the property, or any portion thereof, lies within a protection zone. 
(2)  Every application for development permit which involves property located wholly or partially within a protection zone shall be reviewed by the planning and development director. The planning and development director shall then issue a notice as to whether or not the proposed use or activity meets the requirements of this section. 
(3)  No development order for any activity regulated by this section shall be issued that is contrary to the restrictions and provisions provided in this section. A development order issued in violation of this section shall confer no right or privilege on the grantee and such invalid permit will not vest rights. 
(g)  Protection of future public water supply wells. The prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this section and any regulations promulgated pursuant hereto, shall apply to any future public potable water supply well sites adopted by the city council by resolution. 
(h)  Procedural requirements. The following shall be submitted by the applicant concurrent with any plans for development located within regulated areas: 
(1)  Source of water for irrigation. 
(2)  Existing and proposed wells for potable or irrigational use on all plans submitted for review. 
(3)  A demonstration that potable and/or non-potable wells will not cause saltwater intrusion or adverse impacts to wetlands, lakes or other wellfields by performing a computer model analysis of the groundwater in the surficial aquifer. This shall include a simulation of the drawdown of all the proposed wells pumping during a ninety-day drought period. 
(4)  Nature and extent of proposed water conservation measures. 
(i)  Inspections. 
(1)  City personnel or designated inspectors are hereby authorized and empowered to make inspections at reasonable hours of all land uses or activities regulated by this section including nonresidential buildings, structures and land within wellfield protection zones in the city in order to determine if applicable provisions of the City Code relating to wellfield protection are being followed. 
(2)  Any person subject to this section shall be liable for any damage caused by a regulated substance present on or emanating from the person's property, for all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the city, and damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction or loss resulting from the release or threatened release of a regulated substance. Such removal or remedial action by the city may include, but is not limited to, the prevention of further contamination of ground water, monitoring, containment and clean-up or disposal of regulated substances resulting from the spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting or dumping of any regulated substance or material which creates an emergency hazardous situation or is expected to create an emergency hazardous situation. 
(3)  A notice to cease a land use or activity or an exemption issued under this section, shall not relieve the owner or operator of the obligation to comply with any other applicable federal, state, regional or local code, regulation, rule, ordinance or requirement. Nor shall said notice or exemption relieve any owner or operator of any liability for violation of such codes, regulations, rules, ordinances or requirements. 
(Ord. No. 7500, § 8.5(C), 8-19-91) 
Sec. 34-469. - Conservation of land. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to conserve, manage, and protect natural resources, and maintain and enhance the natural balance of ecological functions in Jacksonville Beach, through the regulation of conservation-protected lands and conservation-restricted lands. 
(b)  Applicability. This section shall apply to all development within the City of Jacksonville Beach. 
(c)  Determination of boundaries. 
(1)  The location of conservation-protected lands and conservation-restricted lands, and policies regarding their future development, are addressed in the future land use, coastal management, and conservation elements of the comprehensive plan and incorporated herein by reference. 
(2)  Any owner of land within Jacksonville Beach may request a determination of the general boundaries of conservation-protected or conservation-restricted lands on their property by submitting a request for determination of boundaries to the planning and development director. The purpose of this general indication of the presence of conservation-protected or conservation-restricted lands within the boundaries of a particular parcel is advisory in nature and shall not substitute for the specific determination of the boundaries pursuant to section 34-469(c)(4). 
(3)  The request must, at a minimum, set forth an adequate description of the land, the nature of the ownership or control of the land, and other information needed to make the determination. 
(4)  A determination of the specific boundaries of conservation-protected or conservation-restricted lands on a parcel or tract shall be made by a person qualified to make such a determination under the applicable federal, state or regional agency regulations. 
(d)  Development of conservation-protected lands. 
(1)  Procedure. Prior to the approval of the development of any conservation-protected lands, as part of the consideration of a development plan pursuant to section 34-251 et seq., the following standards shall be met for the proposed development. 
(2)  Standards for conservation-protected lands. No development activity shall be undertaken on conservation-protected lands, except as provided herein.

7.  Developing an area that no longer functions as a wetland where it can be demonstrated that the water regime has been permanently altered, either artificially or naturally prior to the adoption of the LDC and not in violation of any rule, regulation, statute, or the LDC, in a manner to preclude the area from maintaining surface water of hydroperiodicity necessary to sustain wetland structure and function. If the water regime of a wetland has been artificially altered but wetland species remain the dominant vegetation of the area, a determination of the feasibility of restoring the altered hydrology shall be made prior to approval of any alternative development proposal. If the wetland can be restored at a cost that is reasonable in relation to the benefits to be derived from the restored wetland, a condition in the development order shall require restoration of the wetland. 
d.  Designated water dependent activities. Designated water dependent activities that are otherwise prohibited may be allowed if the applicant demonstrates that the public benefits of the activity substantially outweigh the adverse environmental effects on a conservation-protected wetland area; and no practicable alternative to placement in the conservation-protected lands exists.

ix.  Construction of artificial reefs. 
2.  Standards for water dependent activities. Water dependent activities shall be designed, constructed, maintained and undertaken in a way that minimizes the adverse impacts on the beneficial functions of the affected conservation-protected area. The following standards shall apply to special uses allowed in wetland conservation-protected areas. 
i.  The development shall be designed to allow the movement of aquatic life requiring shallow water; maintain existing flood channel capacity; and assure stable shoreline embankments. 
ii.  Development that encroaches on wetland conservation-protected areas shall not be located on unstable shorelines where water depths are inadequate to eliminate or minimize the need for foreshore channel construction dredging, maintenance dredging, spoil disposal, filling, beach feeding, and other river, lake, and channel maintenance activities; in areas where there is inadequate water mixing and flushing; or in areas which have been identified as hazardous due to high winds or flooding. 
iii.  Access roads, parking lots, and similar structures shall be located on upland sites. 
iv.  Non-developed portions of wetland conservation-protected areas that are damaged during construction shall be restored or replaced through replanting of vegetation, restocking of fish, shellfish, and wildlife, reestablishment of drainage patterns, and similar activities to return the damaged areas to pre-development conditions. To the maximum extent possible, the restored areas shall match their prior ecological functioning. 
(e)  Development of conservation-restricted lands. 
(1)  Procedure. Prior to the approval of the development of any conservation-restricted lands, and as part of the consideration of a development plan pursuant to section 34-251 et seq., the following standards shall be met for the proposed development. 
(2)  Standards for conservation-restricted lands. 
a.  Floodplains. Except as expressly provided in section 34-467 of the LDC, no development activity shall be undertaken on conservation-restricted floodplains.

(f)  Mitigation. 
(1)  Compensatory mitigation by which environmentally sensitive lands are purchased, created, enhanced and/or restored to compensate for the loss of such lands will be required whenever a special use is allowed under section 34-469(d)(2)c. 
(2)  The purchased, created, enhanced, or restored environmentally sensitive land must be of the same type as that destroyed or degraded. 
(3)  Compensatory mitigation shall not be the basis for approving a development that could not otherwise be approved. 
(4)  A developer of a compensatory mitigation plan shall grant a conservation easement under F.S. § 704.06, on the newly purchased, created, or enhanced or restored environmentally sensitive lands to protect them from future development. 
(5)  For wetland conservation-protection areas, the compensatory wetland mitigation shall require that the amount of wetlands purchased, created, enhanced, or restored be large enough to assure that the amount of wetlands destroyed or degraded will be completely and successfully replaced. The following ratios of replacement to destroyed wetlands shall be presumed to provide reasonable assurances for type-for-type mitigation. 
Swamp Hammock 2.0 to 1.0 Hardwood Swamp 2.0 to 1.0 Bayheads and Bogs 2.0 to 1.0 Riverine Cypress 1.5 to 1.0 Cypress Pond 1.5 to 1.0 Wet Prairie 1.0 to 1.0* Freshwater Marsh 1.0 to 1.0* Salt Marsh 1.0 to 1.0*

Sec. 34-563. - Procedure to obtain certificate of public facilities reservation. 
(a)  Submission of application. An application for a certificate of public facilities reservation shall be submitted to the planning and development director in a form established by the planning and development director and made available to the public, along with a nonrefundable fee established by the city council to defray application processing costs. 
(b)  Determination of sufficiency. The planning and development director shall review the application within five (5) working days after its receipt, determine whether the application is complete and includes data necessary to evaluate the application. 
(1)  If the planning and development director determines the application is not sufficient, a written notice shall be mailed to the applicant specifying the deficiencies. No further action shall be taken until the deficiencies are remedied. 
(2)  If the application is determined sufficient, the planning and development director shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the application's sufficiency and that the application is ready for review pursuant to the procedures and standards of this article. 
(c)  Priority for public facility capacity and encumbrance. Priority for remaining public facility capacity for an application being reviewed for a certificate of public facilities reservation shall be based upon the date the application is determined sufficient pursuant to section 34-463(b). The application with the earliest sufficiency date shall have priority for remaining public facility capacity. After the city departments determine there is adequate public facility capacity for a development, that capacity shall be encumbered until final action on the application. 
(d)  Staff evaluation and recommendation. Within fifteen (15) working days of the day the planning and development director determines the application is sufficient, it shall be forwarded to the city departments and evaluated as to whether or not adequate public facilities are available, pursuant to section 34-564. 
(e)  Decision of planning and development director. Within ten (10) working days of receipt of an evaluation from the city departments regarding an application for a certificate of public facilities reservation, the planning and development director shall review the evaluations and application, and determine if it complies with all public facility component standards in section 34-564. If the application complies with all of the public facility component standards in section 34-564, the planning and development director shall issue a certificate of public facilities reservation. If the planning and development director determines that an application fails to meet any of the public facility component standards, the applicant shall be notified of such deficiency, and may either: 
(1)  Remedy the application for a certificate of public facilities reservation within sixty (60) working days, after which the application shall be reconsidered by the planning and development director and approved or denied, consistent with the standards in section 34-564; or 
(2)  Request a conditional certificate of public facilities reservation, which shall be approved by the planning and development director if it is demonstrated that: 
a.  All existing available public facility capacity up to but not greater than an amount sufficient to serve the proposed development has been reserved; 
b.  There is reasonable likelihood that the balance of the public facility capital improvements identified to provide the remaining capacity necessary to accommodate the proposed development can be provided pursuant to a development agreement; 
c.  The applicant requests consideration and approval of a development agreement concurrent with the application for a development permit for which the conditional certificate of public facilities reservation is requested for the purpose of ensuring the certificate complies with the adequate public facility standards for a certificate of public facilities reservation, and; 
d.  The conditional certificate of public facilities reservation is conditioned on the concurrent approval of a development agreement and a development order for the application for development permit that complies with the adequate public facility standards for a certificate of public facilities reservation. 
Prior to the city council consideration of a development agreement in conjunction with an application for development permit, the planning and development director shall review that component of the development agreement related to the provision of adequate public facilities for the proposed development and determine if the public facility capacity standards in section 34-564 for a certificate of public facilities reservation are met if the terms of the development agreement are approved. If the planning and development director determines that the standards of section 34-564 are met if the development agreement is approved, a certificate of public facilities reservation shall be issued, conditioned on the approval of the development agreement with the express terms related to the provision of the public facilities for the proposed development. Upon approval of the development agreement consistent with the terms and conditions which the planning and development director determined would ensure compliance with the requirements of section 34-564, the certificate of public facilities reservation shall become final. If the development agreement upon which the certificate of public facilities reservation is conditionally issued is denied, then the certificate of public facilities reservation shall automatically and immediately expire.

Sec. 34-565. - Mobility fee program. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. Whereas the City of Jacksonville Beach continues to grow primarily through redevelopment and because it has limited opportunity to widen roadways as a mechanism to increase capacity in a largely built-out environment, in order to adequately and efficiently address the city's mobility needs, the City of Jacksonville Beach has replaced transportation concurrency with the mobility fee program. The intent of the mobility fee program is to replace the transportation concurrency management system with a holistic mobility approach that applies a fee system to new development based upon the link between land use and mobility. Through the mobility fee program and this section within Article X, the city is replacing the transportation concurrency management system with a more predictable and balanced system. The purpose of this section is to establish the process necessary to implement the mobility fee program. 
(b)  Mobility fee requirement, certificate, application process and calculation. 
(1)  Mobility fee required. Unless a fair share assessment payment is made or a development is deemed de minimis, or exempt per section 34-523, the mobility fee must be paid prior to approval of final construction and/or engineering plans or building permits for single-family residential construction. 
(2)  Mobility fee calculation application and fee. An applicant for a mobility fee calculation certificate shall file a completed application with the planning and development department on the form provided by that office. The applicant shall provide all the information requested on the application, to the extent applicable together with a two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) filing fee payable to the City of Jacksonville Beach. 
(3)  Sufficiency review. If the planning and development department determines that the information contained in the application is insufficient to review the application, then the department, within five (5) days of its receipt of the application, shall notify the applicant of the application's insufficiencies. The applicant shall then have ten (10) days from the date of such notification to remedy the application's insufficiencies. This time period may be extended by the department based upon a showing of good cause. Any notification by department that the application is insufficient automatically tolls the applicable review period. Upon the department's receipt of the necessary information, the review period begins again at the point at which it was tolled. 
(4)  Issuance of mobility fee calculation certificate. A mobility fee calculation certificate shall be issued by the planning and development department within fourteen (14) days from the date the application is accepted and deemed sufficient by the department. 
(5)  Mobility fee calculation. For the purpose of calculating a mobility fee, the following formula shall apply: 
Mobility Fee = A × B × (C-Trip Reduction Adjustments-Existing Use Trips) 
Where: 
A = Cost per Vehicle Mile Traveled (VMT); 
B = Average VMT within the City of Jacksonville Beach; and 
C = Project Daily Vehicle Trips. 
a.  Cost per VMT. The cost per VMT is determined dividing the cost of the prioritized transportation improvement projects identified in the Capital Improvement Element of the Comprehensive Plan by the projected change in VMT between 2010 and 2030 as set forth in the 2030 Mobility Plan. 
b.  Average VMT within the City of Jacksonville Beach refers to the city's weighted average VMT, as determined by dividing the 2030 model-based projected VMT divided by the 2030 daily trips. 
c.  Project daily vehicle trips and trip reduction adjustments. Unless there is a special local trip generation study approved by the planning and development department, the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) most recent edition of "Trip Generation" shall be utilized to determine project daily vehicle trips. The project daily vehicle trips generated shall be reduced using vehicle trip adjustments based upon physical measures, including but not limited to, residential density, mix of uses, existence of local serving retail, transit service and pedestrian/bicycle friendliness. Such adjustments are derived from the URBEMIS Mobile Source Mitigation Component Model and/or potential Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures for redevelopment projects. The project daily vehicle trips generated shall also be reduced by any daily vehicle trips being generated by existing uses on the property. 
(c)  Re-evaluation of mobility fee formula and trip reduction factors. Every five (5) years the planning and development department shall re-evaluate the city's mobility plan and review and potentially update the mobility fee formula and trip reduction factors. 
(d)  Deposit of mobility fees and appropriation of mobility fees. Mobility fees received by the city shall be deposited into a mobility fee account. The mobility fees collected shall have a reasonable relationship to the transportation impacts generated by any proposed development and shall be appropriated for the prioritized multimodal transportation improvement projects identified in the Capital Improvement Element of the Comprehensive Plan. These projects will include improvements that facilitate multimodal travel and accessibility including roadway, bicycle, pedestrian and transit. 
(e)  Duration of mobility fee calculation certificate. A mobility fee calculation certificate or expedited mobility fee calculation certificate for proposed development of property is valid for two (2) years from the date of issuance, unless it is: 
(1)  Subject to a mobility fee contract per subsection (g), or 
(2)  Extended for one year by the payment, prior to the expiration date, of the applicable annual inflation adjustments as determined by the Florida Department of Transportation Office of Financial Development. 
(f)  Transportation improvement projects constructed by a landowner or developer. 
(1)  Applicability. A landowner or developer may construct, or cause to be constructed, any transportation improvement project that is identified in the 2030 Mobility Plan to offset a calculated mobility fee if the transportation improvement project either: 
a.  Costs the same as the applicant's mobility fee; or 
b.  Costs less than the applicant's mobility fee and the applicant pays the difference between the mobility fee and the cost of the improvement project. 
(2)  Credit against mobility fee. A landowner or developer who constructs, or causes to be constructed, an entire transportation improvement project that is identified in the list of prioritized multimodal transportation improvements in the Capital Improvement Element of the Comprehensive Plan as authorized in subsection (d) shall receive credit against the applicable mobility fee as provided in this section for the design, permitting, and construction of the entire transportation improvement project. 
(3)  Calculation of credit. The credit authorized shall be calculated using the cost estimates in the most recent issue of the Florida Department of Transportation, Office of Policy Planning, and Policy Analysis and Program Evaluation publication entitled Transportation Costs. The cost estimates for facilities and/or projects not identified in Transportation Costs shall be determined by the public works department, prior to the approval of any credit. 
(4)  Timing of credit. The costs shall be deemed incurred and credit shall be provided pursuant to this subsection when a contract for the construction of the entire transportation improvement project is awarded, and a payment and performance bond, or other form of security approved by the city attorney, is provided to the city to guarantee the funding of the facilities and/or projects. The city shall be a co-obligee under the bond or other form of security. 
(5)  Public works department review. All transportation improvement projects shall be approved by the public works department prior to, and after construction to verify completion and fulfillment of any mobility fee requirements. 
(6)  Right-of-way donation. A landowner or developer may also receive credit in the donation of land, if the land is necessary for a transportation improvement identified as a prioritized transportation improvement project identified in the Capital Improvement Element of the Comprehensive Plan. An appraisal shall be required for any donation of land. The landowner or developer and the City of Jacksonville Beach Public Works Department shall mutually agree to the appraiser prior to the appraisal being performed The public works department's agreement shall be evidenced by a memorandum or letter executed by the director of the public works department. 
(g)  Mobility fee contract. 
(1)  After a landowner or developer has obtained a mobility fee calculation certificate or expedited mobility fee calculation certificate for proposed development of property, the landowner or developer may apply to the planning and development division to enter into mobility fee contract wherein the owner or developer of property desires to memorialize an agreement between the City of Jacksonville Beach and the landowner or developer concerning a mobility fee, including, but not limited to any arrangement for credits as set forth in subsection (f), establishment of a payment schedule of the mobility fee according to a phased development pattern, and/or to memorialize credits against future mobility fee payments for the demolition of any structure or use on the subject property. 
(2)  The planning and development division shall review the mobility fee contract application for sufficiency. The department shall determine the applicable mobility fee payment schedule based upon the mobility fee calculated for the development, the mix of uses and the proposed development phasing schedule and any other relevant criteria. Once the department has determined the applicable mobility fee payment schedule, the department shall forward the contract to the planning and development director for review and approval and execution. 
(3)  The mobility fee contract shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and city council and shall include the following: 
a.  A legal description of the land subject to the mobility fee contract and the names and addresses of all of the legal and equitable owner(s) as well as the developer(s), if any, of the land; 
b.  The duration and effective date of the mobility fee contract; 
c.  The proposed land uses or development uses permitted on the land, 
d.  Future Land Use Map (FLUM) designation according to the Comprehensive Plan, and current zoning designation; 
e.  A written description of the intended plan of proposed development; and a site development plan for the land subject to the mobility fee contract. 
(4)  After the director has executed the mobility fee contract, the planning and development department shall record a short form of the fully executed contract in the public records within five (5) calendar days of its receipt of same. 
(h)  Private primary and secondary educational schools exemption. Private primary and secondary educational schools, including any on-site ancillary facilities, shall be exempt from the payment of the mobility fee and the requirements of this section. 
(i)  Credit for trip reduction adjustments. If a developer or landowner has excess credits above his or her mobility fee due to the application of the trip reduction adjustments described in subsection (b)(5)(c), the developer or landowner may use those credits on the property or transfer those credits to other properties or other developers or landowners to offset a mobility fee payment.

(1)  When required. Subject to the requirements of this section, a school concurrency application must be submitted in conjunction with any development proposal. No development proposal will be approved by the city unless a finding of available school capacity and the school concurrency allocation is first obtained. 
(2)  Requirements for school concurrency application. 
(a)  Pre-submittal meeting with school district designee. Prior to submission of a school concurrency application, the applicant shall meet with the school district designee and/or the director to confirm the scope and applicability of this section and to identify potential public school facility deficiencies that may need to be mitigated. At or following the pre-submittal meeting, the school district designee shall: 
(i)  Provide the current school concurrency schedule; 
(ii)  Identify available school capacity; 
(iii)  Provide other relevant and available information regarding demand for public school facilities and available school capacity; 
(iv)  Summarize the scope of the school concurrency application requirements, which shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the information listed in paragraph (b)(2)(b) of this section; and 
(v)  Determine whether or not available school capacity exists and whether the applicant would like to explore proportionate share mitigation possible, the proposed amount and type of proportionate share mitigation. 
(b)  General school concurrency application requirements. The school concurrency application shall include: 
(i)  Name, address, and phone number of the applicant; 
(ii)  Property location, including parcel identification numbers and vicinity map; 
(iii)  A description of the development proposal, including type, intensity and amount of development, adequate to determine the number and type of public school students generated by the development proposal; 
(iv)  A phasing schedule for any development proposal to be completed in more than one phase; 
(v)  A description of any past or proposed public school facility dedicated, constructed, or funded in order to mitigate the public school impacts of the development proposal; 
(vi)  A calculation of any school impact fees that will be assessed prior to occupancy of the dwelling units or lots that are part of the development proposal; 
(vii)  In the event that there is not available school capacity to accommodate the development proposal, a proposed proportionate share mitigation agreement, using the form provided by the school district, and a description of the proposed proportionate share mitigation option(s) being utilized; and 
(viii)  Other relevant information required by the school district that is needed to evaluate the school concurrency application and to make a finding with regard to available school capacity. 
(3)  Completeness review. Within five (5) business days after its receipt, the director will determine whether the school concurrency application is complete and complies with the submission requirements set forth in this section. If the school concurrency application is complete and the submission requirements have been met, the director will forward the school concurrency application to the school district designee for review and a finding with regard to available school capacity. If the school concurrency application is not complete, the director will notify the applicant of its deficiencies in writing within ten (10) business days of its receipt. At the time that the school concurrency application is determined to be complete, the director shall submit it to the school district for review. 
(4)  Finding of available school capacity and school concurrency allocation. 
(a)  Within fifteen (15) business days of the submission to the director of a complete school concurrency application, a revised school concurrency application, or a proffered proportionate share mitigation agreement, the school district shall prepare a written report that: 
(i)  Identifies available school capacity in the relevant concurrency service area, pursuant to the terms of this article and the applicable public schools interlocal agreement; 
(ii)  Identifies any previously dedicated, constructed, or funded public school facility accepted as proportionate share mitigation for the public school impacts of the development proposal; and 
(iii)  Based on information provided by the applicant and its own data and work program, states whether public school concurrency can be achieved for each type of public school facility sufficient to accommodate the development proposal. 
(b)  Finding of available school capacity. 
(i)  Where, based on the standards and methodologies set forth herein, the school district determines that public school concurrency has been achieved, the school district shall issue a finding of available school capacity. 
(ii)  Upon issuance of a finding of available school capacity, the school district designee shall allocate, for up to one (1) year, the amount of school capacity to be required by the development proposal on the school concurrency schedule. This temporary allocation of school capacity will expire either at the end of one (1) year, or upon the withdrawal, rejection or denial of the development proposal. It shall be reduced if, and to the same extent that, the development proposal is amended to reduce the impacts on public school facilities. The school district designee shall issue a school concurrency allocation if the development proposal is approved, and record the school concurrency allocation on the school concurrency schedule. 
(iii)  If a finding of available school capacity is based on a public school facility provided through proportionate share mitigation, final approval of the development proposal shall not be given by the city until the execution of a proportionate share mitigation agreement by the applicant and the school district, pursuant to section 34-566(d). Upon approval of the development proposal, the city shall execute the proportionate share mitigation agreement. 
(iv)  Upon the request of the applicant and for good cause, the school district may grant one (1) one-year extension to the duration of a finding of available school capacity. 
(5)  Duration and effect of a school concurrency allocation. 
(a)  A school concurrency allocation shall remain valid and shall apply to any certificate of occupancy or building permit requested for as long as the approval of the development proposal remains effective. 
(b)  A school concurrency allocation shall not affect the need for the applicant to meet all other requirements set forth in the land development and subdivision regulations or any other lawfully adopted ordinance or law of the city. 
(6)  Finding of no available school capacity; proportionate share mitigation agreements. 
(a)  If the school district designee determines that no available school capacity exists to accommodate the development proposal and no acceptable proportionate share mitigation agreement has been proffered for the school district's and city's execution, pursuant to subsection (3)(iii) below, the school district designee shall issue a finding of no available school capacity, and no school concurrency allocation shall be entered on the school concurrency schedule. 
(b)  Upon the receipt from the school district designee of a finding of no available school capacity, the director must notify the applicant in writing within five (5) business days of the denial. The notice must state the reasons for the denial and any actions that the applicant may take voluntarily to receive a finding of available school capacity. 
(c)  Upon a finding of no available school capacity, an applicant may: 
(i)  Submit a development proposal for a reduced amount of development for which available school capacity exists; 
(ii)  Submit an amended development proposal that includes the following: 
1.  A proposed phasing schedule setting forth the amount, location, and timing of development associated with each proposed phase; 
2.  A showing that available school capacity will exist for each phase of development; and 
3.  Other additional information or materials identified by the school district designee as necessary to ensure public school concurrency; 
(iii)  Proffer an executed proportionate share mitigation agreement, pursuant to section 34-565(h) of this article, which shall fully mitigate the impact of the development proposal on public school facilities; or 
(iv)  Wait until school capacity may exist for the development proposal pursuant to the work program. 
(c)  Procedures for finding whether there is available school capacity. The school district designee shall make a finding with regard to available school capacity in accordance with the requirements of this section and the public schools interlocal agreement, based on the methodology below: 
(1)  The school district designee will measure available school capacity for each school level, based on the school capacity of the concurrency service area in which a development proposal is located. If school capacity is not available in the affected concurrency service area, the school district designee shall determine whether there is available school capacity in any contiguous concurrency service area. 
(2)  For each school type (elementary, middle and high), the school district designee may issue a finding of available school capacity if the following calculation methodology shows that there is available school capacity: 
a.  Formula for total public school facilities 
Total public school facilities = 
Existing public school facilities + 
Planned public school facilities 
b.  Formula for available school capacity 
Available school capacity = 
Total public school facilities - (Current student enrollment + Student stations reserved by a finding of available school capacity + Student stations reserved for exempt development + School capacity required by the development proposal). 
(3)  If a finding of available school capacity is based upon the capacity of one or more contiguous concurrency service areas, then the school district designee shall address the means and timeframes within which the impacts of the development proposal will be shifted by the school district to the contiguous concurrency service area. If more than one (1) concurrency service area has capacity, the school district designee shall determine which one will receive the impacts of the development proposal. Methods to shift impacts may include, but are not necessarily limited to: 
a.  Redistricting; 
b.  Transportation plans; 
c.  Operational adjustments; or 
d.  Terms or conditions agreed to by the applicant. 
(d)  Proportionate share mitigation agreements. 
(1)  Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to an applicant that either has received a finding of no available school capacity or wishes to proffer proportionate share mitigation. 
(2)  Proportionate share mitigation agreement. If it is determined necessary or desirable, the school district and the city may convene a meeting with the applicant or each other if desired, to discuss the specific details of the proportionate share mitigation agreement. The agreement shall provide mitigation that is at least proportionate to the demand for public school facilities to be created by the additional or new residential units in the development proposal, and for which there is no available school capacity. However, this mitigation may not be provided unless it is first accepted by the school district. Any mitigation that is provided for in a proportionate share mitigation agreement must satisfy the demand created by the additional or new residential units, and shall be directed by the school district toward a planned public school facility identified in the work program. 
The school district shall agree to amend the work program during the next annual update to include the school capacity improvement being offered as proportionate share mitigation. The proportionate share mitigation agreement must be signed by the applicant and school district before a finding of available school capacity is issued. The city shall execute the proportionate share mitigation agreement following approval of the development proposal. 
(3)  Options for proportionate share mitigation. If the applicant chooses to enter into a proportionate share mitigation agreement, he or she shall provide one or more of the following proportionate share mitigation options: 
a.  The construction, expansion, or payment for land acquisition or construction of a public school facility; or 
b.  The creation of mitigation banking based on the construction of a public school facility in exchange for the right to sell school capacity credits. The applicant and the school district shall consult on the options available for mitigating the concurrency service area affected by the development proposal. The agreed upon mitigation shall be described in an exhibit to the proportionate share mitigation agreement. 
(4)  Determination of amount of proportionate share mitigation required. The amount of proportionate share mitigation required from an applicant shall be calculated by applying the adopted student generation rate multiplier to the cost per student station estimate for each school type (elementary, middle and high) for which there is not sufficient school capacity. The minimum proportionate share mitigation obligation for a development proposal shall be determined by the following formulas: 
a.  Formula for number of student stations to be mitigated. 
Number of new student stations 
required for mitigation (by school 
type) = 
Available school capacity for the development proposal - 
[Number of dwelling units generated by development proposal (by housing type) × Student generation multiplier (by housing type and school type)] 
b.  Formula for cost of mitigation. 
Cost of proportionate share mitigation = 
Number of new student stations required for mitigation (by school type) × Cost per student station estimate (by school type). 
The full cost of proportionate share mitigation shall be required from the development proposal. 
(5)  Cross jurisdictional impact. If the approval of additional or new residential dwelling units would result in a failure of public school concurrency within a school district in an adjacent county and the applicant seeks to enter into a proportionate share mitigation agreement, the city shall use the formulas set forth in this section to determine the applicant's minimum proportionate share mitigation obligation. Any proportionate share mitigation provided by the applicant shall be directed to the school district in the adjacent county that experiences the failure of public school concurrency. 
(6)  Impact fee credit. The city shall provide a credit for the proportionate share mitigation, calculated pursuant to subsection (d) and provided for in the proportionate share mitigation agreement, toward any impact fee or exaction imposed by ordinance of the city for the same need. 
(e)  School district work program and the capital improvements element. 
(1)  Work program. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the school district's work program is to implement the requirements of F.S. § 1013.33, and to ensure the provision of adequate public school facilities as new residential development occurs in the city. 
(b)  Annual updates and monitoring reports. Pursuant to the public schools interlocal agreement, the city will review, comment, and participate in the development of the school district's work program and will provide input with respect to the work program's consistency with the Comprehensive Plan. Considering the input of the city, the school district shall amend the work program annually by October 1 to include the immediately subsequent fifth year of public school facilities. Each annual update shall address the status of public school facilities, including, but not limited to the following: 
i.  The available school capacity by concurrency service area; 
ii.  Anticipated increases in residential development within the city and the incorporated municipalities within the county; 
iii.  The existing and projected level of service for each concurrency service area by year for the five (5) year planning period; 
iv.  For each concurrency service area and each year of the five-year planning period, the financial feasibility of providing the needed school facilities to achieve and maintain the Level of Service Standard; 
v.  The current need for any public school facilities resulting from changes in population trends, employment growth, or other relevant factors; 
vi.  The rate and location of development of exempt development; 
vii.  Any amendments necessary to effectuate the purpose and intent of this article and state law, including any demand assumptions, need factors, and other matters recommended by the school district for reconsideration or revision; and 
viii.  The projected financing for any additional school capacity resulting from the factors set forth in subsections (i) through (v), above. 
(2)  Capital Improvements Element. The Capital Improvements Element of the city's Comprehensive Plan shall be amended each year by December 1 to reflect the most recent update to the work program. Adoption shall be by reference to the specific date of approval by the school district of the updated work program. 
(f)  Appeal of school concurrency determinations. An applicant may appeal a determination by the school district designee to the school district or any final decision by the director, made pursuant to the terms of this section, to the Jacksonville Beach City Council. Appeals must be filed with the planning and development director within thirty (30) business days of the determination or decision being appealed. Appeals shall be heard by the Duval County School Board or the Jacksonville Beach City Council, as appropriate, at an evidentiary hearing at which the reasons for the decision and the evidence relied upon shall be presented. The applicant also shall have the opportunity to present the reason for appeal and evidence in support of the appeal. The Duval County School Board or Jacksonville Beach City Council, as appropriate may: 
(1)  Affirm the decision of the school district designee or director; 
(2)  Remand the matter to the school district designee or director for further proceedings; or 
(3)  Reverse the decision of the school district designee or director. Decisions of the Duval County School Board or the Jacksonville Beach City Council may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.

ARTICLE XII. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 34-621. - Purpose and intent. 
    Within the provisions established by the LDC, there exist uses of land, structures and lots that were lawfully established before the LDC was adopted or amended, that now do not conform to the terms and requirements of the LDC. The purpose and intent of this article is to regulate and limit the continued existence of those uses, structures and lots that do not conform to the provisions of the LDC or any amendments thereto. 
    It is the intent of the LDC to permit these nonconformities to continue, until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival except under the limited circumstances established in this article. It is further the intent of the LDC that changes in nonconformities shall not be permitted. The provisions of this article are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities to preserve the integrity of the LDC and the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 7500, § 12.1, 8-19-91) 
Sec. 34-622. - Nonconforming uses. 
    Nonconforming uses of land are declared generally incompatible with the LDC. Nonconforming uses of land may continue in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(1)  Normal maintenance or repair. Normal maintenance or repair of structures where nonconforming uses are located may be performed in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, to an extent not exceeding fifteen (15) percent of the current assessed value of the structure, provided that the cubic content of the structure existing after the date it became nonconforming shall not be increased, except pursuant to the standards of this section. 
(2)  Enlargement or expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded in area occupied, except a nonconforming use may be enlarged in any area of a structure that is manifestly designed and approved for such use, prior to the date the use became a nonconformity. 
(3)  Characteristics of nonconforming uses. If characteristics of use such as off-street parking and loading, or other matters related to the use of land are made nonconforming, no change shall be made in such characteristics of use which increase nonconformities, provided however, changes may be made which do not increase or decrease such nonconforming uses. 
(4)  Relocation. A structure housing a nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole, or in part, to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located, unless the relocation of the nonconforming use decreases the nonconformity. 
(5)  Change in use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use, unless any new or additional use conforms to the provisions of the LDC for the zoning district in which the use is located. 
(6)  Discontinuance or abandonment. If a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of more than six (6) consecutive months, whether or not the equipment or furniture are removed, then such use may not be re-established or resumed, and any subsequent use shall conform to the provisions specified by the LDC. When government action can be documented as the reason for discontinuance or abandonment, the time of delay by government shall not be calculated for the purpose of this section. 
(7)  Unsafe because of maintenance. If a nonconforming structure or portion thereof containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to the lack of repairs or maintenance, and is declared by a duly authorized official of Jacksonville Beach to be an unsafe structure, it shall thereafter be rebuilt and repaired in conformance with the standards of the LDC and the building code. 
(Ord. No. 7500, § 12.2, 8-19-91) 
Sec. 34-623. - Nonconforming structures. 
    A nonconforming structure devoted to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located at the time of its construction, may be continued in accordance with the provisions in this section. 
(1)  Normal maintenance. Normal maintenance or repair to permit continuation of a nonconforming structure may be performed in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, to an extent not exceeding fifteen (15) percent of the current assessed value of the structure, provided that the cubic content of the structure existing after the date it became nonconforming shall not be increased, except pursuant to the standards of this section. 
(2)  Enlargement or expansion. A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or expanded in area occupied, except a nonconforming use may be enlarged in any area of a structure that is manifestly designed and approved for such use, prior to the date the use becomes a nonconformity. 
(3)  Characteristics of nonconforming structures. If characteristics of use such as off-street parking and loading or other matters related to the use of a structure are made nonconforming, no change shall be made in such characteristics of the structure which increases nonconformities. Provided however, changes may be made which do not increase or decrease the nonconforming structure. 
(4)  Relocation. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to another location on or off the parcel of land on which it is located, unless it conforms to the standards and requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(5)  Damage and restoration of nonconforming structure. No building which has been damaged by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value of the structure immediately prior to damage, shall be restored, except in conformity with the standards of the LDC, and all rights as a nonconformity are terminated. If a structure is damaged by less than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value, it may be repaired and reconstructed and used as before the time of damage, provided that such repair or reconstruction be substantially completed within twelve (12) months after the date of such damage. 
(6)  Unsafe because of maintenance. If a nonconforming structure, or portion thereof, or any structure or portion thereof containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to the lack of repairs or maintenance, and is declared by a duly authorized official of Jacksonville Beach to be an unsafe structure, it shall thereafter be rebuilt and repaired in conformance with the standards of the LDC and the building code. 
(Ord. No. 7500, § 12.3, 8-19-91) 
Sec. 34-624. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
    Where a lot or parcel of land has an area or frontage which does not conform to the standards of the LDC, but it was a lot of record on the effective date of the LDC, such lot or parcel of land may be developed, provided the minimum yard standards for the zoning district in which it is located are met. 
(Ord. No. 7500, § 12.4, 8-19-91) 
Sec. 34-625. - Nonconformities created by eminent domain proceedings. 
(a)  Authority to gain certificate of conformity. A structure, lot, or parcel of land that is rendered or will be rendered nonconforming because of eminent domain proceedings initiated by a governmental authority, or by the sale of a parcel of land under the threat of eminent domain proceedings shall be considered conforming under the terms of the LDC through the receipt of a certificate of conformity, pursuant to the terms of this section. A certificate of conformity may authorize the relocation of existing conforming or nonconforming structures with modifications to property development regulations. 
(b)  Applicability. Either the condemnor or condemnee may submit an application requesting a certificate of conformity, pursuant to the terms of this section. 
(c)  Procedure. 
(1)  Application. A condemnor or condemnee may submit an application requesting a certificate of conformity to the planning and development director either before or after the first negotiation/appraisal of the condemnor or the order of taking in the eminent domain proceeding, or after the sale of a parcel of land under the threat of an eminent domain proceeding. The application shall include the following: 
a.  A legal description of the property subject to the eminent domain proceeding, or sold under the threat of an eminent domain proceeding; 
b.  The name and address of the owner of the property; 
c.  The name and address of the condemnor, and the name and address of the condemnor's representative; 
d.  If relevant, proof of the actual or impending eminent domain proceeding by a notification of condemnation, demand letter, or resolution or ordinance of the condemnor; 
e.  A certified survey of the property, no greater than one (1) year old, subject to the eminent domain proceeding or sold under the threat of an eminent domain proceeding that demonstrates the extent of the condemnor's acquisition, and all principal and accessory structures on the property; 
f.  A site plan of the property subject to the eminent domain proceeding or sold under the threat of an eminent domain proceeding at a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals thirty (30) feet, showing: (1) the location of all structures and improvements on the property; and (2) the extent of the condemnor's acquisition; 
g.  An explanation of why the certificate of conformity should be granted; 
h.  Proof that notification of the application has been provided to the other party (condemnor or condemnee, whichever is relevant); and 
i.  The application fee, as established by resolution of the city council. 
(2)  Determination of sufficiency, review and decision. After receipt of an application requesting a certificate of conformity, the planning and development director shall determine whether it is sufficient within ten (10) working days. If it is determined the application is not sufficient, notice shall be served on the applicant specifying the deficiencies. The planning and development director shall take no further action on the application unless the deficiencies are remedied. Within twenty (20) working days after the application is determined to be sufficient, the planning and development director shall review and grant, grant with conditions, or deny the application, pursuant to the standards established in section 34-525(d). 
(d)  Standards. An application requesting a certificate of conformity shall be granted if the following standards are met. 
(1)  Minimization of business and severance damage. If the condemnation action has not been decided by a court of law, the amount of severance and business damages resulting from the eminent domain proceedings are substantial, and the loss of business damages would be minimized by the issuance of a certificate of conformity; 
(2)  Site plan that minimizes nonconformities while ensuring compatibility. A site plan can be designed for the property which is consistent with the use requirements of the LDC, minimizes to the greatest degree practicable any nonconformities of parking, loading, landscaping, lot size and yard requirements; and 
(3)  Function adequately. The structure or lot can function adequately for its designated land use pursuant to the site plan proposed in section 34-525(d)(2).

--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2007-7938, § 1, adopted August 6, 2007, amended art. XIII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. XIII, §§ 34-636-34-640, pertained to enforcement procedures and penalties, and derived from Ord. No. 7500, §§ 13.1-13.5, adopted August 19, 1991. 

Sec. 34-636. - General. 
    The provisions of the LDC shall be enforced (1) by the special magistrates ("special magistrate") pursuant to the Article VI of Chapter 2 of this Code, (2) by the planning and development director, (3) by the city council through its authority to enjoin and restrain any person violating the code, or (4) by the City of Jacksonville Beach through the prosecution of violations in the name of the State of Florida. 
(Ord. No. 2007-7938, § 1, 8-6-07) 
Sec. 34-637. - Planning and development director. 
(a)  Authority. Upon determination by the planning and development director that any provision of the LDC has been violated, the planning and development director shall send a written notification of violation to the owner of record of the land or structure involved, and to the person responsible for the violation, or request the city attorney through the city manager to initiate immediate civil actions to enjoin and restrain the violation, or both.

(1)  The section of the LDC being violated. 
(2)  An order to cease such violation. 
(3)  Information concerning penalties for violation of the LDC. 
(c)  Notice of violation. If any violation continues for fifteen (15) working days after receipt of a warning of violation, the planning and development director shall issue a notice of violation which shall include a reference to the particular section of the LDC that is being allegedly violated, a short plain statement of the matters asserted, and other evidence of the alleged violation. 
(Ord. No. 2007-7938, § 1, 8-6-07) 
Sec. 34-638. - Enforcement by special magistrate. 
    Any violation of the LDC may be prosecuted by the special magistrate pursuant to the following standards and procedures. 
(1)  Warning of violation. If an alleged violation of the LDC is found; the planning and development director shall notify the alleged violator and give him fifteen (15) working days to correct the violation pursuant to Article VI of Chapter 2 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(2)  Issuance of notice of violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the planning and development director shall issue a notice of violation to the alleged violator pursuant to Article VI of Chapter 2 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(3)  Notice of hearing. Upon issuance of the violation notice, the planning and development director shall notify the appropriate clerical staff person who shall notify the special magistrate of the violation notice and shall schedule a hearing for the special magistrate on the violation. Notice of hearing shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Article VI of Chapter 2 of the Code of Ordinances, unless the planning and development director has reason to believe a violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(4)  Correction of violation. If the alleged violation is corrected and then recurs, the planning and development director shall issue a notice of violation and a notice of hearing to the alleged violator and schedule a hearing. The specialist magistrate shall hear the alleged violation in this instance, even if it has been corrected prior to the special magistrate's hearing and every notice shall so state. 
(5)  Procedure at hearings. The special magistrate shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The special magistrate shall take testimony from city staff, if relevant, the alleged violator, and other relevant testimony. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and govern the proceedings. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded, but other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible. At the hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the city to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists, or existed at the time the planning and development director issued the notice of violation. 
(6)  Action by the special magistrate. 
a.  The special magistrate may, at his/her option, issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law; and may issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted in this article and in Chapter 162, Florida Statutes at the conclusion of the hearing. All such findings of fact, conclusions of law, and orders shall be issued not later than thirty (30) days from the date of the hearing. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by said date. The order shall have the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property. The findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the special magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
b.  In the event that a violator has been previously determined to have violated a provision of the code within the prior five (5) years, the special magistrate may require that the violator comply with appropriate mitigation measures to the land where the violation was committed. Such measures may include, but is not limited to, landscaping, biological restoration, and requirements for posting performance bonds to ensure compliance with the order of the special magistrate. 
(7)  Notification of action. Notification of the special magistrate's action shall be delivered by the city clerk to the violator by regular mail within ten (10) days of the hearing. 
(8)  Failure of alleged violator to appear. If an alleged violator who has received proper notice fails to appear at the hearing, the special magistrate shall enter an order against the alleged violator requiring correction of the violation. The enforcement of such an order may be stayed if the violator files a request for a re-hearing with the appropriate clerical staff person within ten (10) calendar days from the date the order is rendered, and demonstrates good cause for such failure to appear. In such case, the violator will be rescheduled for a hearing before the special magistrate at the next scheduled hearing. If at that hearing, the special magistrate finds that good cause existed for the violator's failure to appear, the prior order shall be rescinded and a new hearing conducted immediately. If the special magistrate fails to find good cause for the failure to appear, the previous order shall remain in effect. 
(9)  Stop work on existing approval. The special magistrate shall, when a violation of a special magistrate order has been determined to exist, direct the planning and development director not to issue any subsequent development permit(s) for the development until the violation has been corrected and inform the violator that no further work under an existing approval may proceed until the violation has been corrected. 
(10)  Fine. The special magistrate may order the violator to pay a fine that shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation, and shall not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for a violation found to be irreparable or irreversible in nature. In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the gravity of the violation; any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(11)  Fine constitutes lien. A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Duval County, Florida, and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Such lien may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against personal property, but shall otherwise not be deemed a judgment of a court except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city, and the city may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien that remains unpaid, the city may foreclose on the lien or sue to recover a money judgment for the lien and accrued interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property that is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not apply to real or personal property that is covered under Section 4(a), Article X of the State Constitution. 
(12)  Appeal. Any aggrieved party may appeal an order of the special magistrate by certiorari proceedings in the Circuit Court of Duval County, Florida. The petition for writ of certiorari must be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of execution of the order to be appealed. The scope of review shall be limited to the record made before the special magistrate and shall not be a trial de novo. 
(Ord. No. 2007-7938, § 1, 8-6-07) 
Sec. 34-639. - Civil remedies. 
    The city council or any aggrieved or interested person shall have the right to apply to the Circuit Court of Duval County, Florida, to enjoin and restrain any person violating the provisions of the LDC, and the court shall, upon proof of the violation of same, have the duty to forthwith issue such temporary and permanent injunctions as are necessary to prevent the violation of same. 
(Ord. No. 2007-7938, § 1, 8-6-07) 
Sec. 34-640. - Criminal remedies.
