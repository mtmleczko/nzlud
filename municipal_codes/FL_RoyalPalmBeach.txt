PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the Village of Royal Palm Beach, Florida, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of Chapter 5 is Section 5-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 6-3 and 6-4 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-3.1, 6-3.2 and 6-3.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 9 and 10, it will be designated as Chapter 9.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publishers are most grateful to Robert C. Bryer, Village Manager and Herbert P. Benn, Village Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Villager's affairs.

This official village seal shall be the sole property of the Village of Royal Palm Beach, and any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. §§ 775.082 or 775.083, [and] as set forth in F.S. § 165.043. 
(Ord. No. 471, § 1, 2-17-94) 
Sec. 2-5. - Guidelines for the purchase of real property by the village. 
(a)  Purchase of real property utilizing exemption from F.S. § 119.07(1), as provided by F.S. § 166.045. Prior to purchasing any real property in which an exemption is proposed to be utilized from the mandatory public records inspection and copying usually required by F.S. § 119.07(1), every appraisal, offer or counteroffer must be in writing and such writings are not available for public disclosure or inspection until an option contract is executed or, if no option contract is executed, until thirty (30) days before a contract or agreement for purchase is considered for approval by the village council. For the purposes of this section, the term "option contract" means a proposed agreement by the village to purchase a parcel of real property, subject to the approval of the village council at a public meeting after thirty (30) days public notice. In no case whatsoever shall the village be under any obligation to exercise the option unless the option contract is approved by the village council. The village manager is authorized to negotiate and execute multiple offers and counteroffers related to any proposed purchase of real property prior to the execution of any option contract, contract or agreement for purchase that is to be considered for approval by the village council at the public meeting referenced hereinabove. 
(1)  Appraisal requirement. At least one (1) appraisal performed by a member of an approved appraisal organization or by a state-certified appraiser with no vested or fiduciary interest in such parcel shall be required in order to purchase real property in an amount not to exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00). For each proposed purchase in an amount in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00), the village shall obtain at least two (2) such appraisals. Notwithstanding the purchase dollar amounts hereinabove, village council may exempt a proposed purchase of real property in an amount less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) from obtaining any appraisal by a simple majority vote of council approving such purchase for this lessor dollar amount. If two appraisals are required, then the proposed seller and the village will evenly split the costs of the appraisals. 
(2)  Council approval vote requirement. If the purchase price is equal to or less than the required single appraised value or equal to or less than the average of the appraised value for the two (2) required appraisals, then only a simple majority vote of the council is required for approval of the purchase of the real property. If the purchase price exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) and the agreed purchase price exceeds the average of the two (2) required appraisals, village council may only approve such purchase by a majority-plus-one vote. Village council reserves the right to reject any and all purchase offers and to make such real property purchase as in their sole determination would be in the best interests of the citizens of the Village of Royal Palm Beach, subject to the vote requirements hereinabove. 
(b)  Purchase of real property not utilizing any public records exemption. Prior to purchasing real property by the village where no public records exemption is being utilized pursuant to state law, the village manager may negotiate multiple offers and counteroffers, either verbally or in writing. Upon the parties negotiating and reaching an agreed purchase price, such offer of purchase shall be set forth either in the form of an option contract as defined hereinabove, a purchase contract, or an agreement for purchase, any of which agreement formats will be considered by village council at a public hearing prior to approval. A proposed purchase contract or an agreement for purchase may be placed on council agenda with ten (10) days' public notice, rather than the thirty-day public notice required for the option contract. During such negotiation and approval process, any public records created during this purchase process will be subject to the requirements of F.S. § 119.07(1). 
(1)  Appraisal requirement. At least one (1) appraisal, by an appraiser as set forth in this section, is required for any purchase of real property except as set forth below. If the parties agree that two (2) appraisals should be performed, by appraisers as set forth in this section, the costs of such appraisals will be evenly split between the village and the proposed seller. Notwithstanding the above, if the proposed purchase amount is less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), then no appraisal is required. 
(2)  Council approval vote requirement. For any offer of purchase that is not subject to public records exemption pursuant to state law, the village council may approve the purchase of real property that in their sole determination would be in the best interests of the citizens of the Village of Royal Palm Beach. The village council also reserves the right to reject any and all purchase offers that in their sole determination would not be in the best interests of the citizens of the Village of Royal Palm Beach. Such votes, either in favor or against the purchase, shall be by simple majority vote.

(6)  Screening of service yards and other places which tend to be unsightly, shall be accomplished by the use of walls, fencing, planting, or combinations of these. Screening shall be effective in winter and summer. 
(7)  In areas where general planting will not prosper, other materials such as fences, walls and paving of wood, brick, stone, rocks and gravel shall be used.

Sec. 4-26. - Authority. 
    This code is enacted under the home rule power of the Village of Royal Palm Beach, in the interest of the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the Village of Royal Palm Beach and under the authority of the Village of Royal Palm Beach, hereafter, the "village," to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages under the Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 1, 10-3-96) 
Sec. 4-27. - Scope. 
    This adult entertainment code shall be in effect throughout the village. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 1, 10-3-96) 
Sec. 4-28. - Purpose and intent. 
    The intent of the village council in adopting this code is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations for the adult entertainment industry that will protect the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the village. It is not the intent of the village council to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity. These matters are regulated by federal and state law, including Chapter 847, Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 1, 10-3-96) 
Sec. 4-29. - Findings of fact. 
    Based on the evidence and testimony presented at the public hearings before the village council and on the findings incorporated in the United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning, Department of Metropolitan Development, City of Indianapolis, January, 1984, the village council hereby finds the following: 
(a)  Uses exist or may exist within nearby unincorporated Palm Beach County or other nearby cities where books, magazines, motion pictures, prints, photographs, periodicals, records, novelties and/or other devices that depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(b)  Adult entertainment establishments exist or may exist within the village and other nearby cities or counties where dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical area; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(c)  The activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) occur at adult entertainment establishments which operate for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the village in the interest of health, safety, economy, property, values, and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the village. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere. 
(d)  When the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) above are presented, other activities that are illegal, immoral or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and land. 
(e)  When the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) above are present, they tend to blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower property values, promote crime, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(f)  The concurrence of the sale of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community. 
(g)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) creates additional hazards to the health and safety of persons in attendance and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment. 
(h)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the village, it is necessary and advisable for the village to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at adult entertainment establishments where the activities described in subsection (a) and/or (b) occur. 
(i)  There is a direct relationship between the activities described in subsections (a) and/or (b) above and an increase in criminal activities, moral degradation and disturbances of the peace and good order of the community, and the occurrence of these activities is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining land and harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole. These secondary effects are adverse to the public's interest and quality of life, the tone of commerce and the community environment in the village. 
(j)  Based upon these findings, it is in the interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the village that adult entertainment uses are regulated pursuant to the following standards.

(c)  Formulae utilized for office and commercial retail uses. 
    The office and commercial retail rates shown above are only examples. The actual trip rates for these land uses will be determined by the following formulae: 
(1)  Office: 
Total Daily Trips = Ln(T) = 0.768Ln(X) + 3.654 
T = Total Daily Trips 
X = Area in 1,000 sq. ft. 
Ln = Natural Logarithm 
(2)  Commercial Retail: 
Total Daily Trips = Ln(T) = 0.643 Ln(X) + 5.866 
T = Total Daily Trips 
X = Area in 1,000 sq. ft. 
Ln = Natural Logarithm 
(3)  The mobile homes parameters utilized are for mobile homes located within mobile home parks. Any other mobile home would be treated as a single family detached dwelling unit. 
(d)  Mixed uses; modifications. 
(1)  If a building permit is requested for mixed uses, then the fee shall be determined according to the above schedule by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the schedule. 
(2)  If the type of development activity a building permit is applied for is not specified on the above fee schedule, the impact fee coordinator shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the above fee schedule. The impact fees in the schedule have been calculated using accepted trip generation, trip length, capture/diversion and capital road facility costs standards and applying the appropriate credits. Land uses not listed in the fee schedule shall be as defined in the most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual. 
(3)  In the case of change of use, redevelopment or modification or expansion of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in impact for the new use as compared to the previous use. 
(e)  Independent fee calculation option; adjustments; appeals. 
(1)  Independent fee calculation. If a feepayer opts not to have the impact fee determined according to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section as applicable, then the feepayer shall prepare and submit to the impact fee coordinator an independent fee calculation study for the land development activity for which a building permit is sought indicating that the impact fee as established in the schedules set forth in paragraphs (a) and/or (b) above are not appropriate for the particular development. The impact fee coordinator shall adjust the impact fee if substantial evidence is submitted that clearly demonstrates an adjustment is necessary under the methodology upon which the impact fee is based. The burden shall be upon the feepayer to provide all relevant data, analysis and reports which would assist the impact fee coordinator in making a determination. The analysis and report must be based on generally accepted practices and methodologies and the formulae upon which the impact fees are based. 
(2)  Appeals. The impact fee coordinator's action in adjusting or refusing to adjust the impact fee pursuant to an independent calculation shall be in writing and must be transmitted by certified mail to the feepayer. This decision may be appealed to the impact fee appeals board by filing a written petition with the impact fee coordinator within fifteen (15) days of the impact fee coordinator's transmittal of the written decision. It shall specifically state the reasons for the appeal and shall contain such data and documentation that the appellant seeks to rely upon. Petitions not timely filed and delivered to the impact fee coordinator shall be deemed waived. 
(3)  Land uses not specified in fee schedule. If the type of land use for which a building permit is applied is not specified on the impact fee schedule, the impact fee coordinator shall select the most comparable type of land use from the most current edition of Trip Generation, a publication of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). If the impact fee coordinator determines that there is no comparable type of land use in the most current edition of Trip Generation, then the impact fee coordinator shall request a determination of the impact fee from the village engineer, who shall use the best available traffic generation data, other trip characteristics data, costs per lane mile data, and credit data. 
(4)  Covenants required. The impact fee coordinator may require that a covenant running with the land be executed and recorded on the development's property in accordance with section 10-80, where: 
a.  The independent calculation is based on a use of land having a lesser impact than that upon which the schedule set forth in each division is based as applicable; 
b.  The development could be put to a use having a greater impact than that proposed with such greater use not requiring future approval by the village; or 
c.  For such other reasons necessary to ensure compliance with this division. 
(Ord. No. 392, § 2(6), 1-30-91; Ord. No. 406, § 2, 4-18-91; Ord. No. 513, § 3, 10-17-96; Ord. No. 605, § 3, 3-1-01; Ord. No. 953, § 2, 7-6-17) 
Sec. 10-73. - Same-Payment. 
(a)  The impact fees shall be paid no later than the time the building permit is issued. 
(b)  In the event that impact fee funds which were paid by check, draft or other negotiable instrument do not clear, the building permit or development order authorizing the development for which the impact fees were paid shall be suspended. The impact fee coordinator shall send by certified mail notice of the suspension to the feepayer. If the impact fees together with any charges for the funds not clearing are not paid within ten (10) business days following mailing of the notice, the building permit or development order shall be of no further force and effect for purposes of this division, and a stopwork order shall be issued and not lifted until such time as the impact fees are paid and the funds clear. 
(Ord. No. 392, § 2(7), 1-30-91) 
Sec. 10-74. - Trust funds-Established. 
(a)  Three (3) impact fee trust funds are hereby established: 
(1)  The park/recreation capital facilities impact fee trust fund; 
(2)  The public buildings capital facilities impact fee trust fund; and 
(3)  The local roads capital facilities impact fee trust fund. 
    The specified impact fees identified in section 10-72 shall be deposited in the appropriate trust fund. 
(b)  Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used in accordance with the provisions of section 10-75 of this division. 
(c)  The trust funds shall be invested by the village in interest-bearing sources, and all income derived shall accrue to the applicable trust fund. 
(d)  The funds shall be used only for capital facility costs for which the impact fee was levied and which would add capacity needed to serve new development. 
(e)  The respective trust funds shall be nonlapsing. 
(Ord. No. 392, § 2(8), 1-30-91; Ord. No. 605, § 4, 3-1-01; Ord. No. 953, § 2, 7-6-17) 
Sec. 10-75. - Same-Use. 
(a)  The village shall be entitled to retain up to but not more than three (3) percent of the funds collected to compensate them for the administrative expense of collecting and administering this division. All remaining funds shall be used solely for the purpose of the capital improvements for which they were collected. Such improvements shall be of the type made necessary by the new development. Impact fees for law enforcement and fire protection and rescue capital facilities are hereby repealed effective July 6, 2017. All funds contained in the law enforcement and fire protection and rescue capital facilities impact fee trust funds shall be transferred to the public buildings capital facilities impact fee trust fund, and shall be used for public buildings capital facility purposes thereafter. 
(b)  Funds shall be expended in the order in which they are collected. 
(c)  Each fiscal period, the village manager shall present to the village council proposed capital improvement expenditures for parks/recreation, public buildings, and local roads assigning funds, including any accrued interest, from the respective impact fees trust funds to capital facilities projects and related expenses. Monies, including any accrued interest, not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the trust funds until the next fiscal period except as provided by the refunds provisions of this division. 
(d)  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of capital facilities for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities provided are of the type described in paragraph (a) above. 
(Ord. No. 392, § 2(9), 1-30-91; Ord. No. 953, § 2, 7-6-17) 
Sec. 10-76. - Exemptions. 
(a)  The following shall be exempted from the payment of the respective impact fees as applicable: 
(1)  Alteration, expansion or replacement of a building or unit existing on the effective date of this article or a presently existing building or unit where the number of units or nonresidential square footage is not increased or the use does not change or any change in use results in no new impact on a capital facility for which the impact fee is assessed. A use of structure or land which has been abandoned for a period of more than five (5) years shall not be considered existing for purposes of this section and section 10-77, Credits. Any previous payment of impact fees under this division shall be credited against the appropriate impact fees owed as a result of the change. The burden of demonstrating the existence of a use or structure or previous payment of impact fees shall be upon the feepayer. In cases where a use is existing, any additional fees shall be based upon the alteration to the existing use of structure. 
(2)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures where the use is not changed such that an additional impact results and the number of units or nonresidential square footage is not increased. 
(b)  An exemption must be claimed by the feepayer or developer at the time of the issuance of a building permit. Any exemption not so claimed shall be deemed to have been waived by the feepayer or developer. 
(Ord. No. 392, § 2(10), 1-30-91) 
Sec. 10-77. - Credits. 
(a)  Generally. Credits shall be given as specified below against appropriate impact fees for the following: 
(1)  Redevelopment of an existing building or unit; 
(2)  In-kind contributions. 
(b)  Redevelopment of existing building/change in land use. Where alteration, expansion or replacement of a building or unit or a change in land use existing on the effective date of this article or presently existing which involves an increase in the number of units or nonresidential square footage or a change in use resulting in new impacts on a capital facility for which the impact fee is assessed, credit shall be given for the number of existing units or nonresidential square footage based upon the previous land use, and impact fees shall only be assessed on the increased impact. 
(c)  In-kind contributions. 
(1)  In-kind contributions made to the village shall be credited against the development's impact fees in accordance with this section and the relevant sections of this division. Credits for in-kind contributions shall apply only to the particular impact fee; e.g., park/recreation impact fee credits may not be applied against public building impact fees. No credit shall be given for in-kind contributions which are not capital facilities or which were not made for capital facility costs. 
(2)  In-kind contributions prior to effective date of this article. In the case of in-kind contributions made to the village prior to the effective date of this article and except as specifically provided in the development order or development agreement, the value of the in-kind contribution at the time of conveyance, dedication, construction, placement, delivery or remittance, as the case may be, shall be prorated between the building permits for which complete application was made prior to the effective date of this article and building permits in the development which remain to be issued and for which no complete application was made prior to the effective date of this article. The portion of the value allocated to the building permits for which complete application was made on or after the effective of this article shall be adjusted to present value as of the effective of this article using a compound interest rate of five (5) percentum per annum compounded quarterly. The portion allocated to the building permits for which complete application was made on or after the effective date of this article and adjusted to present value shall be credited. At the option of the feepayer, when the village reviews and updates the impact fee for which the credit is established, the then-remaining available credit, if any, may be adjusted. The adjustment shall be the same percentage as the percentage of increase costs of capital facilities to the village used in establishing the updated impact fee amount. For purposes of determining how many permits and the land use and square footage associated with such, the number of permits shall be determined by the most recently approved master or site plan, the size and land use of the proposed buildings for the remainder of the planned development, the ability to build that square footage given other land development regulations and other relevant information. 
(3)  In-kind contribution after effective date of this article. 
a.  In the case of an in-kind contribution made to the village after the effective date of this article, the value of the in-kind contribution shall be credited in accordance with the principles established below. 
b.  If the conveyance, dedication, construction, placement, delivery or remittance, as the case may be, was to have been made prior to the effective date of this article pursuant to a condition of a development order, a development agreement or otherwise as required by the village: 
1.  The value of the in-kind contribution shall be established as of the required date of conveyance, dedication, construction, placement, delivery or remittance; 
2.  The five (5) percentum compound interest adjustment (compounded quarterly) shall commence on the date of conveyance, dedication, construction, placement, delivery or remittance; and 
3.  The apportionment of value shall be based on the date conveyance, dedication, placement, delivery or remittance was to have been made. 
c.  Independent calculations for credits for in-kind contributions made after the effective date of this article shall be submitted to and approved by the impact fee coordinator prior to effecting the contribution. 
d.  At the option of the feepayer when the village reviews and updates the impact fee for which the credit is established, the then-remaining available credit, if any, may be adjusted. The adjustment shall be the same percentage as the percentage of increased costs of capital facilities to the village used in establishing the updated impact fee amount. 
(4)  Application of credits. The credit shall be applied to the respective full impact fee associated with the first building permits issued for the development for which complete application was made on or after the effective date of this article until the credit is exhausted. After such exhaustion, the remainder of the impact fee for which a credit was obtained shall be paid in full. The credit shall be calculated and applied in dollar amounts and not numbers of permits. 
(5)  Credit shall be given for land at such time as marketable title in fee simple absolute is conveyed to the village free of encumbrances with such documentation and requirements set by the village council or the village manager for the acceptance of real property. Credit shall be given for personal property at such time as a bill of sale absolute and, where applicable, title for such property is delivered to the village. Credit for money shall be given at such time as the funds are delivered to the village. 
(6)  The amount of credit shall be determined by the impact fee coordinator pursuant to an application for an independent calculation. It shall be the burden of the person claiming the credit to provide the impact fee coordinator with all information and analysis relevant to the claimed credit. The determination of the impact fee coordinator must be rendered in writing and transmitted to the petitioner within forty-five (45) days of submission of a complete petition for credit unless the impact fee coordinator and petitioner agree to a different time. The petition shall not be considered complete until all information and analysis required by the impact fee coordinator have been provided. If a petition for credit is pending, building permits may be issued without payment of an impact fee provided the impact fee is escrowed by an agreement approved by the impact fee coordinator. 
(7)  In the event that an in-kind contribution is not made prior to the issuance of building permits, the feepayer or developer shall post performance security with the village to ensure completion of the in-kind contribution or payment of the impact fee. No building permit shall be issued until the performance security is posted. Building permits shall not be issued or shall be revoked if performance security lapses or is found to be insufficient. Notice of the performance security shall be recorded referencing the development land or shall be referenced in the covenant set forth in section 10-80, Covenant. This section shall not apply to in-kind contributions of land except where the land was to have been dedicated or conveyed prior to the effective date of this article and was not conveyed and for which the developer or feepayer is taking action to perfect fee simple absolute marketable title free of encumbrances in the village. 
    Credit shall be applied only to the development for or from which the in-kind contribution was made and not to any other development. 
(8)  The feepayer or developer may petition the impact fee appeals board to review the credit determination of the impact fee coordinator. In addition to reviewing the reports and independent calculation, as applicable, the impact fee appeals board may consider additional relevant evidence such as whether a developer or feepayer has reasonably relied on any act or omission of the village and therefore substantially changed his position such that an estoppel exists. In making such a determination, the impact fee appeals board shall consider the advice of the impact fee coordinator and may seek the legal advice of the village attorney. The burden shall be on the petitioner to affirmatively demonstrate a material error in the decision or estoppel. The written petition must be filed with the impact fee coordinator within fifteen (15) days of the impact fee coordinator's transmittal of the written determination. The petition shall state the reasons for the appeal and include such information and documentation on which the petitioner seeks to rely. 
(9)  In establishing the amount and allocation of credit, the impact fee coordinator and the impact fee appeals board, as the case may be, shall be governed by the provisions of this article, the reports and independent calculation, as applicable. 
(10)  The burden of producing evidence and existence of and entitlement to a credit shall be on the feepayer or developer applying for the credit. 
(Ord. No. 392, § 2(11), 1-30-91; Ord. No. 953, § 2, 7-6-17) 
Sec. 10-78. - Refunds. 
(a)  (1)  Noncommencement. In the case of noncommencement on development for which impact fees were collected, the impact fees shall be refunded. Refunds shall be made only upon documentation as set forth below and shall be made to the feepayer unless another person is designated by the feepayer; in which case, that designated person shall receive the refund. Applications for refund for noncommencement and change in land use or structure shall be made within ninety (90) days of the permit lapsing or being revoked or canceled or the permit modification for a change to the structure or change in land use or the event giving rise to the refund request not to exceed one (1) year following the date the building permit is issued. Refunds not requested within such time shall be deemed to have been waived. Refunds for noncommencement shall be the amount paid less a total administrative fee not more than three (3) percentum. No refunds shall be given for a change in land use or structure after occupancy has occurred. 
(2)  The petition for a refund for noncommencement must be submitted to the impact fee coordinator and must contain the following: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the feepayer or is otherwise entitled to the refund and the basis for the refund. If the person seeking the refund is not the feepayer, a copy of the document indicating that person as entitled to the refund. 
b.  A copy of the dated receipt issued for payment of the impact fees or other proof of the date and amount of payment of the fees for the development. 
(b)  Timely encumbrance.

ARTICLE I. - ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 11.5-1. - General. 
(a)  Title . These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of Village of Royal Palm Beach, Florida, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
(b)  Scope . Unless otherwise specifically indicated, the provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(c)  Intent . The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(d)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code . This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  Warning . The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance. 
(f)  Disclaimer of liability . This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Village Council of Village of Royal Palm Beach, Florida or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(g)  Conditions for issuance of variances . Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this ordinance or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the village council that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 15-1. - Declaration of legislative intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of the village council to provide for the general promotion of the health, safety, welfare, and well being of the community by establishing rules, regulations and guidelines regarding the protection of existing vegetation; the installation of native landscaping; and the maintenance and management of all vegetation including, but not limited to, trees, shrubs, ground cover, and aquatic vegetation within the corporate limits of the village in order to provide for the following: 
(a)  Aesthetics. Improve and preserve the aesthetic appearance of residential neighborhoods and ensure attractive streetscapes and vistas in the village. 
(b)  Environment. Improve environmental quality by recognizing and encouraging the numerous effects of landscaping upon the environment, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Improving air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake; 
(2)  Maintaining the ability of the soils to contribute to aquifer recharge; 
(3)  Reducing and reversing air, noise, heat, and chemical pollution through biological filtering capacity of trees and other vegetation; 
(4)  Promoting energy conservation through the creation of shade, the reduction of heat gain in or on buildings and paved areas, and reducing the temperature of the microclimate through the process of evapotranspiration; 
(5)  Reducing the erosion of soils; 
(6)  Reducing surface velocity of winds; and 
(7)  Providing habitat for wild life. 
(c)  Water conservation. Promote water conservation by encouraging xeriscaping and utilization of native and drought-tolerant landscape material; utilization of water conserving irrigation practices; adherence to landscape installation standards and maintenance procedures that promote water conservation; ecological placement of landscape material; and utilization of natural areas and vegetation. 
(d)  Land values. Increase land values by requiring landscaping in development which may become a capital asset. 
(e)  Human values. Provide direct physical and psychological benefits to humans by reducing the noise and glare in addition to breaking up the visual monotony and softening the perception of urban environment. 
(f)  Improve design. Promote innovative and cost-conscious approach to design, installation, and maintenance of landscaping, and encourage water and energy conservation through sound land development and forestry practices. 
(g)  Removal of prohibited plant species. Require the removal of nuisance vegetation to insure the preservation of protected or native vegetation. 
(h)  Preservation. Encourage the preservation of protected or native vegetation and ecosystems by incorporating these into landscape design. 
(i)  Compatibility. Promote efficiency in the development of limited land resources by improving the compatibility of otherwise incompatible land uses in close proximity, particularly residential developments that are adjacent to commercial and industrial developments by buffering such development. 
(j)  Comprehensive plan. Implement the goals, objectives, and policies of the comprehensive plan.

ARTICLE IV. - VEGETATION PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION 

Sec. 15-71. - Vegetation removal permit required; applicability. 
(a)  In general. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, no person, corporation, association, public agency, or agent or employee thereof, shall remove vegetation from any lot or portion thereof within the village without first obtaining a vegetation removal permit from the community development department. Single-family detached or duplex residences shall obtain a no-fee vegetation removal permit prior to the removal of any trees, shrubs or hedges in order to ensure that the parcel or parcels retain the minimum landscaping required pursuant to sections 15-3 or 15-130 and to ensure the protection of specimen trees. All other developments, or applicants seeking to remove vegetation on undeveloped land, shall obtain a vegetation removal permit, and pay the associated permit fee as established by resolution of the village council, prior to the removal of any trees, shrubs or hedges in order to ensure that the parcel or parcels retain the minimum landscaping required pursuant to sections 15-3 or 15-130 and to ensure the protection of specimen trees. 
(b)  Applicability to public agencies. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, all public agencies shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter. The village, however, shall not be subject to: 
(1)  The permit application fees established by section 15-71; or 
(2)  The penalties established by section 15-4 of this chapter. 
(c)  Other required permits. The issuance of a vegetation removal permit pursuant to this chapter shall not relieve the applicant of his duty to obtain all required permits from other governmental agencies having jurisdiction over land development activities. 
(d)  Where hardwood hammock, cypress heads, wetlands, palmettos, sand pine/scrub or pine flatwood associations are present, every effort shall be made to preserve and protect these areas. The applicant shall endeavor to include the above features in the open space requirements for the proposed development. See section 15-127(d).

If the application is submitted by an agent, it shall include a notarized agency agreement clearly indicating that the property owner has delegated full authority to apply for the permit and to accept the terms of any special conditions which may be imposed by the community development department. The application shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the lot owner and his agent. 
(c)  Contents of application. Each application for a vegetation removal permit shall consist of the following: 
(1)  Generalized vegetation survey. A generalized vegetation survey showing the approximate location and extent of vegetation upon the site is required. The survey shall be based upon the most current available information. For nonresidential and multifamily developments, the survey may be in the form of an aerial or a field survey, and shall be accompanied by photographs illustrating areas of vegetation. For individual single-family or duplex developments, the survey may be in the form of hand-drawn sketches accompanied by photographs of existing site conditions. If site development plans have been prepared, the generalized vegetation survey shall be prepared to the same scale or in some other manner which clearly illustrates the relationship between areas of vegetation and proposed site improvements. If no site development plans are available, the generalized vegetation survey shall be prepared to a convenient scale which clearly reveals the extent of vegetation upon the site. The intent of this subsection is to insure that the community development department is sufficiently informed by the applicant of vegetation conditions on the subject property prior to development of same. Regardless of form, the survey must show all specimen trees along with their density height and trunk dimensions. All trees and vegetation to be removed shall be clearly noted, and all specimen trees proposed for removal shall be individually noted; 
(2)  Written assessment and evaluation. The generalized vegetation survey shall be accompanied by a brief written assessment of the plant communities which have been identified on the site. The assessment shall include an evaluation of character and quality of the plant communities identified, including their rarity, viability, and such other physical characteristics and factors which may effect their preservation. The written assessment also shall include a brief statement describing the need for, and intent of the proposed work. 
(3)  Additional information. The planning and zoning department may require that the application include such additional information which is reasonable and necessary for adequate administration of this chapter. 
(4)  Number of copies. The application and accompanying documents shall be submitted to the community development department along with three (3) copies. 
(d)  Standards of review. The application shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning department on the following criteria: 
(1)  The extent to which the actual or intended use of the property requires removal, cutting down or destruction of trees and vegetation; 
(2)  The desirability of preserving any tree by reason of its size, age, or some other outstanding quality, such as uniqueness, rarity or status as a protected tree or specimen tree; 
(3)  The extent to which the area would be subject to increased water runoff and other environmental degradation due to removal of the trees and vegetation; 
(4)  The desirability of preserving or enhancing tree cover in densely developed populated areas; 
(5)  The need for visual screening in transitional areas, or relief from glare, blight, commercial or industrial unsightliness or other affront to the visual or aesthetic sense in the area; 
(6)  The effect that changes in the natural existing grade will have on the trees to be protected and preserved; 
(7)  The effect that changes in the natural or existing grade will have on drainage and its impact on adjoining properties; 
(8)  The health of the existing trees on site; 
(9)  The extent to which existing tree coverage provides connections to adjacent open space, wildlife habitat, or natural vegetative areas; and 
(10)  Whether the tree is part of a village-approved streetscape program. Trees planted pursuant to a village-approved streetscape program shall be considered required landscaping and protected vegetation once installed.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 945, § 4, adopted Dec. 20, 2018, changed the title of § 15-72 from "Application for permit; contents" to read as herein set out. 
Sec. 15-73. - Granting of permits; minimum standards. 
(a)  When vegetation removal permits shall be granted. The planning and zoning department shall grant a vegetation removal permit, which shall subsequently be issued by the community development department, provided that the application is accomplished by sufficient evidence either that: 
(1)  All vegetation and trees are removed, replaced, relocated or mitigated in accordance with this chapter; and 
(2)  Removal, replacement, relocation or mitigation, as applicable, is being accomplished pursuant to an approved plan such as: 
a.  A bona fide site development plan, a village-approved streetscape program, or a written vegetation removal plan; or 
b.  A preliminary site development according to an orderly program which includes a vegetation management element. Such element must be consistent with the intent of this chapter; and substantially conform to the environmental protection standards outlined in the latest edition of "Silvaculture Best Management Practices Manual" prepared by the division of forestry of the state, or to best management practices for vegetation protection recognized by such professional associations as the American Forestry Association, the American Arborists Association, or the American Society of Landscape Architects. 
(b)  Vegetation removal permits for specimen trees. Notwithstanding the above, no vegetation removal permit shall be issued for specimen trees unless the planning and zoning department finds that at least one (1) of the following criteria is satisfied with respect to each specimen tree designated for removal: 
(1)  The specimen tree is located within the net buildable area of a given site as identified on the tree survey and site plan submitted by the applicant and there is no reasonable alternative to relocate or reconfigure the improvements; 
(2)  The specimen tree is located within an existing or proposed right-of-way and there is no reasonable alternative to relocate or reconfigure the improvements; 
(3)  The specimen tree is located within an existing or proposed easement, stormwater management tract or facility, provided that only the minimum area reasonably necessary for the service or use shall be considered for purposes of determining whether there is necessity for specimen tree removal; 
(4)  The specimen tree is in danger of falling or is located where it creates a safety or health hazard or a nuisance with respect to existing structures, vehicles or pedestrian routes and there is no reasonable method by which to rehabilitate or restore the health of the tree through proper pruning or other remediation techniques in order to mitigate the safety or health hazard or nuisance. The planning and zoning department may require verification of claim(s) be provided by the applicant from a certified engineer or certified arborist in the State of Florida; 
(5)  The specimen tree is located where it interferes with the installation, delivery or maintenance of proposed or existing utility services to the site and there is no reasonable alternative to relocate or reconfigure the improvements; 
(6)  The specimen tree is confirmed by the planning and zoning department, or by a certified arborist to be deteriorated, diseased, dead or severely injured, and there is no reasonable method by which to rehabilitate or restore the health of the tree through proper pruning or other remediation techniques; 
(7)  The tree unreasonably prevents development of a lot or parcel of the physical use thereof. However, a vegetation removal permit shall not be granted where the applicant has failed to design and locate the proposed improvements so as to minimize the removal of trees consistent with the permitted use of the lot or parcel under the village zoning code; or 
(8)  The property is in compliance with the minimum number of specimen trees to be preserved per acre pursuant to section 15-78(b). 
(c)  Conditions of approval. The permit may provide for special conditions of approval, which may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Limits on extent of removal. The extent of approval to remove vegetation shall be limited by the planning and zoning department to the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the removal operation and in order to address the criteria outlined in section 15-72(d). This may include limiting the extent of approval to portions of a site or specifying special conditions by which removal shall take place (e.g., root pruning for relocation). Such limitations shall be clearly indicated in writing in the vegetation removal permit. If vegetation removal is limited to portions of a site, the extent of such limitation shall be clearly delineated on the face of any site development plans. Surety may be required as a condition of approval. 
(2)  Limits on nature of removal operations/clearing procedures in order to address the criteria outlined in section 15-72(d). 
(3)  Replacement requirements. Replacement of vegetation or trees removed may be required if the vegetation or trees are specimen trees, or required pursuant to a site plan, permit, development order or sections 15-3 or 15-130. 
(d)  Posting of permit. A copy of the approved vegetation removal permit shall be clearly posted on the job site during all phases of clearing and construction activities. 
(e)  Issuance of permit not approval of violation. The issuance of a vegetation removal permit shall not be construed to be a permit for or approval of any violation of this chapter. 
(f)  Protective barriers. A suitable protective barrier, constructed of metal, wood, or other durable material, shall be placed around individual protected trees, specimen trees, or other vegetation, being preserved to protect them from damage during the land clearing and construction stages of development, as follows: 
(1)  At a distance of six (6) feet or more from all species of mangroves; or 
(2)  At a distance of six (6) feet or more, or at a distance outside of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the radius of the dripline, from all protected hardwood trees, whichever is greater; or 
(3)  At a distance of six (6) feet or greater, or at a distance of the radius of the dripline of all protected conifers, whichever distance is greater; or 
(4)  As otherwise provided in special conditions attached to a vegetation removal permit. 
(g)  Other protective measures. Unless otherwise provided by law or in the terms of special conditions included in a vegetation removal permit, groups of protected trees, specimen trees, or areas of vegetation to be preserved shall not require protective barriers. However, such areas shall be prominently highlighted by the installation of stakes installed a maximum of fifty (50) feet apart. Ropes, plastic tape, ribbons, or similar material shall be attached to the stakes around the perimeter of the protected area. No marking materials shall be attached to a protected tree or specimen tree. Special care shall be taken that preservation areas are properly marked so that equipment operators can see the limits of permitted removal activity. 
(h)  Removal of protective measures. Protective barriers or protective designations shall remain in place until they are authorized to be removed by appropriate building or other field inspection staff or until receipt of a certificate of occupancy. 
(i)  Failure to protect. Failure to provide vegetation protection as stated herein shall constitute tree abuse and is violation of this section. Abused and/or trees removed within a preservation area shall be replaced in accordance with section 15-79 with such planting guaranteed for one (1) year.

Sec. 15-74. - Development within preservation area. 
(a)  [Vegetation within a preservation area.] The entire vegetation within a preservation area shall either be: 
(1)  Maintained in its natural state; or 
(2)  Provided with permeable landscape material, such as grass, ground cover, or mulch; or 
(3)  Designed to conform to the landscape code as amended. 
(b)  [Grade changes.] No grade changes shall be made within the vegetation preservation area which require trenching or cutting of roots, except in compliance with the terms of special conditions in an approved vegetation removal permit. Ditching for underground irrigation and utility lines within vegetation protection areas shall be done in a way that plant root systems are protected to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the following will also apply to a vegetation preservation area: 
(1)  No soil shall be removed from within a vegetation preservation area; 
(2)  No fill material, construction material, concrete, paint, chemicals, or other foreign materials shall be stored, deposited, or disposed of within a vegetation preservation area; 
(3)  No signs, permits, wires, or other attachments, other than those of protective and nondamaging nature, shall be affixed or attached to protected vegetation; 
(4)  If landscaping is to be installed within a vegetation preservation area after removal of protective barriers or designations, installation shall be accomplished using light machinery and hand labor; and 
(5)  Heavy equipment shall not be driven, parked, or stored within designated vegetation preservation areas. 
(c)  [Display of permit.] The permit shall be prominently displayed on site. 
(d)  [Department inspection.] Planning and zoning department inspection shall be required prior to the issuance of a building permit to insure compliance with minimum standards of vegetation protection. 
(e)  Supplemental vegetation protection standards. In addition to the minimum standards established above, supplemental standards may be imposed by the planning and zoning department as a special condition of a vegetation removal permit. These supplemental standards shall be based upon the suggested standards in the latest edition of "Tree Protection Manual for Builders and Developers," published by the division of forestry of the state department of agriculture and consumer affairs, or a similar recognized reference manual. A reference copy of the division of forestry manual is available at the planning and zoning department.

Sec. 15-76. - Exemptions to permit requirement. 
    No vegetation protection permit shall be required for the removal of vegetation in the following situations: 
(a)  Initial construction of individual single-family or duplex residents. The initial construction of one (1) single-family detached or one (1) duplex residence upon a single lot of less than one and five-tenths (1.5) acres in size not part of an overall development with approved landscape plans. However, any vegetation protected as part of the overall development landscape permit may not be removed without a permit or mitigation. See section 15-73. 
(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  Hazardous situations. Removal of a protected or specimen tree which has been destroyed or so severely damaged by natural causes that it constitutes a peril to life or property due to the close proximity to vertical construction. Replacement or mitigation may still be required after removal of protected or specimen trees, or to satisfy site plan, permit, development order or sections 15-3 or 15-130 requirements. In order to qualify for this exemption to the permit requirement, documentation (e.g., photographs) shall be taken prior to the removal, which demonstrates the hazardous situation, the species of tree being removed and the trunk size DBH (in inches). Trees planted pursuant to a village-approved streetscape program may be removed for hazardous conditions as outlined in the streetscape program development order. 
(d)  Bona fide agricultural production. Bona fide agricultural production, provided however that bona fide agricultural production shall not include lumber harvesting incidental to land development permitted by a bona fide site development plan. 
(e)  Installation and maintenance of certain rights-of-way and easements. The removal of vegetation by or pursuant to the direction of public or private utilities, public airports and heliports, the South Florida Water Management District, public drainage districts, and similar agencies, whether or not emergency conditions exist, provided that the vegetation is either: 
(1)  Located within utility or drainage easements or public rights-of-way; or 
(2)  Actually or potentially interfering with utility services, drainage, or aircraft flight patterns. 
(f)  Botanical or horticultural activities. Botanical gardens, botanical research centers, or licensed commercial nurseries. 
(g)  Vegetation required to be removed by law. Vegetation which is required to be removed by law, ordinance, or the lawful exercise of some other public power. 
(h)  Prohibited vegetation. Except for land clearing on an undeveloped parcel, no permit shall be required for the removal of prohibited vegetation. Prohibited vegetation shall be removed prior to development of a parcel. Removal shall be accomplished so as to minimize seed dispersal. In order to qualify for this exemption to the permit requirement, documentation (e.g., photographs) shall be taken prior to the removal, which demonstrates the prohibited vegetation removed.

(b)  Required preservation of specimen trees. All specimen trees not exempted by this chapter shall be preserved and protected according to the schedule below. 
Number of Specimen Trees 
on Site Minimum # of Specimen Trees to be Preserved 1 per acre 100 percent of all specimen trees 1.1 to 3 per acre 2 per acre 3.1 to 5 per acre 3 per acre 5.1 to 8 per acre 4 per acre More than 8 per acre 50 percent of all specimen trees per acre, up to a maximum of 6 trees per acre  
Tree counts may be averaged over the total number of acres in a development project. For individual single-family lots that are less than one (1) acre in size, the actual size of the lot shall be substituted for the term "acre" above in order to calculate the minimum number of specimen trees to be preserved on that lot. 
(c)  Conservation easements and development orders. For the purpose of site planning and/or platting new residential and nonresidential developments, specimen trees are to be preserved and maintained by the use of tree conservation easements granted to the village, or through development orders issued by the village. For new planned unit developments, developers shall locate tree conservation easements or areas wholly within common areas of a homeowners association, property owners association, or other similar entity, and not on an individual private lot unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning department, to ensure public and/or resident benefit and enjoyment. The minimum size of such easement or area shall be one (1) foot diameter for every one (1) inch diameter at breast height or the dripline of the tree, whichever is greater, unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning department. 
(d)  Relocation of specimen trees. Specimen trees may be relocated pursuant to a vegetation removal permit. Relocated specimen trees that die, deteriorate or become diseased after re-planting shall be replaced in accordance with the village's tree replacement formula contained in section 15-79. 
(e)  Replacement of specimen trees. Specimen trees shall be replaced in cases where such trees are diseased, deteriorated, or dead. In such case, the developer or property owner may replace the trees pursuant to a replacement schedule approved by the planning and zoning department and according to the village's tree replacement formula contained in section 15-79. Replacement trees allowed under this subsection shall only count toward the specimen tree being replaced, and shall not count toward any other individual lot requirements unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning department. 
(f)  Tree survey/protection and preservation after construction. As part of a land clearing permit, vegetation removal permit, site plan, landscape plan, or plat application, a tree survey shall be required to identify and locate all specimen trees on the site. A developer shall provide or shall be subject to legal mechanisms which insure the protection of specimen trees after building construction has occurred on the site. Such mechanisms may include, but shall not be limited to, conditions of approval contained in development orders, conservation easements, common open space, tree protection easements, deed restrictions and homeowner association documents. 
(Ord. No. 945, § 4, 12-20-18) 
Sec. 15-79. - Tree replacement. 
(a)  In general. In order to maintain the wooded and natural character of the village and provide for perpetual reforestation of the urban forest, all specimen trees, or trees required pursuant to sections 15-3 or 15-130, a site plan approval, permit or other development order, that are removed from a site shall be replaced. 
(b)  Replacement schedule for trees. Replacement trees shall be provided in accordance with the following schedule: 
Tree Diameter 
at Breast Height Required 
Replacement Trees 2-8? 1 9-16? 2 17-24? 3 25-32? 4 33-40? 5 41? + 6  
However, this tree replacement schedule shall not be followed, and trees shall be replaced on a one-to-one ratio at the minimum size specifications contained in section 15-130 regardless of the size of the tree diameter at breast height or specimen tree classification, in the following circumstances: 
(1)  A tree becomes deteriorated, dies or is severely injured, and there is no reasonable method by which to rehabilitate or restore the health of the tree through proper pruning or remediation techniques; 
(2)  Such deterioration, death or severe injury is caused by a named storm event for which there has been a declaration of emergency issued for Palm Beach County, by lightning, or by a motor vehicle accident; and 
(3)  Such deterioration, death or severe injury due to the named stormed event, lighting, or motor vehicle accident, and the inability to rehabilitate or restore the health of the tree, is confirmed by the planning and zoning department. The planning and zoning department may require verification of claim(s) be provided by a property owner. 
If a specimen tree becomes deteriorated, dead or severely injured due to a named storm event, lighting, or a motor vehicle accident, and qualifies for the one-to-one replacement schedule, then the specimen tree shall be replaced with one (1) tree at the minimum size specifications contained in section 15-130 regardless of whether the tree is a required tree pursuant to a site plan, permit, development order, or sections 15-3 or 15-130 of village Code. 
(c)  Replacement species and size. Trees to be removed shall be replaced with the same species or a similar species as approved by the planning and zoning department, planning and zoning commission, or village council as applicable. The minimum size specifications for replacement trees shall be the minimum landscaping requirements contained in section 15-130. Replacement plantings shall be guaranteed for one (1) year. In the event that replacement requirements cannot be determined due to insufficient trunk of a removed tree (e.g., cannot determine species or DBH), such removed tree shall be replaced in the same manner as a specimen Live Oak at ten-inch DBH. 
(d)  Replacement location. Replacement trees should be planted in the same location as the original tree, wherever possible. Replacement trees planted in areas other than the original location shall be first approved by the planning and zoning department, planning and zoning commission, or village council, as applicable, depending on whether a site plan, permit or development order modification is required. Such replacement trees shall be located in an area accessible to irrigation or hand watering to ensure survival. 
(e)  Tree bank. If site constraints make it impossible or impracticable to provide the requisite number of replacement trees on the property, at the determination of the planning and zoning department, the person or entity required to provide replacement trees shall have the option to donate replacement trees to the village for placement on village-owned property or for use in a neighborhood reforestation plan as approved by the village council, or make a contribution to the village's tree bank based on the tree banking formula listed below: 
Specimen Tree Banking Formula 
Minimum DBH (in inches) to qualify as a specimen tree based on species x number of replacement trees × accepted national value per caliper inch 
Non-specimen Tree Banking Formula 
2.0 (minimum inches DBH) or actual DBH of removed tree, whichever is greater x number of replacement trees x accepted national value per caliper inch 
    The accepted national value shall be based upon the Guide for Plant Appraisal, 10th Edition (United States), as amended from time to time. 
    The village shall establish a separate project account for the tree bank for the deposit of mitigation payments as required by this chapter. All monies deposited in the tree bank shall be expended, utilized and disbursed for the purchase and installation of trees on any village-owned land, or pursuant to a neighborhood reforestation plan as approved by the village council. Such monies also may be used for ancillary costs associated with the above-mentioned tree purchase and installation including but not limited to, landscaping around trees, sprinkler systems, labor, consultant services and such other services or materials necessary and proper for the preservation, maintenance, relocation or restoration of tree ecosystems. These monies also may be utilized to purchase land intended for conservation, tree preservation or public open space.

Sec. 15-126. - Landscape plans submission and approval. 
    Prior to the issuance of site plan approval, a landscape plan shall be submitted to and approved, approved with modifications, or denied by the planning and zoning department for technical compliance with this section. The planning and zoning department shall approve, approve with modifications, or deny a landscape plan within thirty (30) days of submittal of the plan. Approved plans subject to review under section 2-75.27(b), shall be transmitted from the department to the planning and zoning commission for commission review and comment. The commission shall advise the village council of the commission's recommendation regarding the plan within thirty (30) days of receipt of the plan by the commission. Final action on the landscape plans for all proposed commercial, single-family, multifamily, and industrial development shall be taken by the village council. Individual single-family dwellings and duplexes shall be exempt from submitting a landscape plan to the village. 
(Ord. No. 617, § 1, 11-29-01; Ord. No. 784, § 1, 5-3-07; Ord. No. 945, § 5, 12-20-18) 
Sec. 15-127. - Landscape plans contents. 
(a)  Upon submittal of a generalized vegetation survey as prescribed herein at Article IV, Vegetation protection and preservation, landscape plans shall be drawn to scale and bear the name, signature, address, and seal of a Florida-registered landscape architect. The designer shall have full responsibility for the design. The designer or agent are encouraged to visit the site and indicate any and all conditions which will or may affect the landscape material, to include, but not be limited to, prevailing winds, overhangs, overhead obstructions, utility services, deep-shadow locations or unusual soil conditions. 
(b)  The landscape plan shall illustrate the following: 
(1)  Location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures and improvements; 
(2)  Drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals thirty (30) feet, including dimensions and distances; 
(3)  The location, size, description, specifications, and planting instructions (whether ball, burlap, or container material) for all proposed plant material; 
(4)  Existing trees and material; 
(5)  Spacing, grade, soil; 
(6)  Description of any adjacent conditions which affect the landscaping; 
(7)  Grade of planting and mulch specifications; 
(8)  Plans providing sufficient irrigation; 
(9)  Clearly delineate the proposed and/or existing parking spaces or other vehicular use areas, access aisles, and driveways. 
(c)  The existing natural landscape character shall be preserved whenever possible. By way of example, in an area containing a stand of trees, the applicant shall preserve as many trees as possible. Further landscaping shall be accomplished in a complementary manner. At least fifty (50) percent of all required landscaping shall be classified as native or drought tolerant. Plant material lists on xeriscape landscaping are available from the planning and zoning department. Existing vegetation must be indicated on the landscape plan. Protection of the existing vegetation during construction is required. All undeveloped portions of the lot shall be so indicated on the plan and shall be protected and remain undisturbed. 
(d)  Where hardwood hammock, cypress heads, sand pine/scrub or pine flat wood associations exist, a tree survey prepared by a professional is required. As an alternate, an aerial dated no earlier than one (1) year prior to the date of submission of the landscape plan, of a scale not less than one (1) inch to sixty (60) feet, may be submitted in lieu of a tree survey. The tree survey or aerial, if submitted, shall indicate the native hammocks or associations and any significant trees or rare endangered native vegetation on site with these hammocks or associations. A professional shall be a licensed surveyor or landscape architect. 
(e)  Landscape design and planning shall be integrated with the development design concept. Toward this end, proposed landscaping schemes will be evaluated based on their relationship to the existing natural landscape, developed landscape, other proposed landscape (including those on adjacent properties and street rights-of-way) and exiting and proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 617, § 1, 11-29-01; Ord. No. 945, § 5, 12-20-18) 
Sec. 15-128. - Alternative landscape plans. 
(a)  Any applicant for development approval appearing before the planning and zoning commission may request approval of an alternative landscape plan which may not meet the specific, express terms of this chapter, but nevertheless may be approved upon demonstration of the following: 
(1)  The proposed alternative landscape plan is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter; 
(2)  That the intention of a proposed alternative landscape plan is to preserve and incorporate existing native vegetation and/or habitat into the design of a project in excess of minimum standards required elsewhere in this chapter or demonstrates innovative, unique and exceptional landscape design and use of plant materials; 
(3)  The proposed alternative landscape plan does not result in fewer than the minimum number of trees required elsewhere in this chapter; and 
(4)  The proposed alternative landscape plan does not violate the terms or conditions of any code or ordinance of the village and is not a substitute for any variance required to be obtained by this or other ordinances of the village. 
(b)  The planning and zoning commission may approve an alternative landscape plan after considering recommendations by staff and demonstration of compliance with the above. Deviations from an approved alternative landscape plan requires new approval from the planning and zoning commission. 
(Ord. No. 617, § 1, 11-29-01; Ord. No. 784, § 2, 5-3-07) 
Sec. 15-129. - Protection of public infrastructure. 
(a)  Restricted plant species permitted by section 15-9 with roots known to cause damage to public roadways or other public works and infrastructure shall not be planted closer than fifteen (15) feet to such public improvements unless the tree root system is completely contained within a barrier for which the minimum interior dimensions shall be five (5) feet square or an equivalent and five (5) feet deep and for which the construction requirements shall be four-inch-thick concrete reinforced with #6 road mesh, 
6 × 6 × 6, or an equivalent approved by the building official. 
(b)  All existing prohibited trees listed at section 15-8 which cause or are causing damage to public works and roadways or private sewer lines, septic tanks, and drainage fields shall be removed within ninety (90) days from date of damage; otherwise, this section shall be deemed violated. 
(c)  Each landscape plan required or permitted by this chapter shall include a program to eradicate and prevent the reestablishment of prohibited plant species. The community development department may approve a phased eradication program where a prohibited species is required to be removed from the site on which a use is proposed. A phased eradication program shall include the installation of an approved landscape buffer plan meeting the requirements of this section and schedule for the removal of prohibited plants species when the required buffer has matured to the point where the prohibited species may be removed without undue exposure to the adjacent land use. 
(d)  An existing mature specimen of a prohibited species may be permitted to be retained upon demonstration of methods proposed to control potential root damage to utilities, public improvements or other structures. A waiver must be obtained pursuant to section 15-37 in order to permit such a mature, prohibited species to be retained.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 617, adopted Nov. 29, 2001, included two articles designated Art. V. At the editor's discretion, this article was redesignated as Art. VI for clarity. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 15-141. - General landscape requirements; irrigation; xeriscape. 
(a)  Maintenance. 
(1)  The owner, tenant, and their agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance and protection of all landscaping existing or hereafter installed. Landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition and shall be kept free from refuse, debris, harmful insects, and disease. Maintenance shall include watering, except during declared drought conditions, weeding, mowing, fertilizing, treating, mulching, pruning, removal/replacement of dead or diseased landscaping and removal of refuse and debris on a regular basis so as to provide a neat, trim, and well-kept appearance at all times. 
(2)  The general maintenance and pruning of trees shall not include the practice of "hatracking", wherein a top of a tree is flat-cut severing the leader or leaders, making internodal cuts to lateral limbs or pruning a tree by stubbing off mature wood larger than three (3) inches in diameter. This method of pruning is strictly prohibited except for treatment of diseased trees or other necessary pruning to maintain or restore the health and viability of a tree by a certified arborist or landscape architect, or unless the trees are on the prohibited vegetation list. This method of pruning is deemed to be irreparable and irreversible in nature. 
(b)  Inspection. The community development department to ensure proper maintenance shall inspect landscaping periodically and shall notify the owner, tenant, or agent in writing of any areas that are not being properly maintained. The owner, tenant, or agent shall, be given a reasonable time period from the time of notification to restore landscape to a healthy condition. If restoration is not accomplished the given time period, a notice to appear before the code enforcement board or special magistrate will be given to the owner, tenant, or agent. 
(c)  Irrigation and xeriscape. To further preserve water resources, the use of native plant material in landscape designing through xeriscape techniques is highly encouraged. The water requirements of native plant materials are adjusted to local weather cycles and result in lower water usage than that of non-native plant materials. Materials on xeriscape landscaping with native plant material are available at the planning and zoning department. Applicants are encouraged to review these materials and incorporate xeriscape design in all proposed landscape plans. The planning and zoning department shall require the installation of at a minimum of fifty (50) percent of plant material to be installed to be of a native, cold, and drought-hardy variety. 
(1)  Plans providing sufficient irrigation, as determined by a license landscape architect, professional engineer, or qualified licensed irrigation contractor, for the requirements of the plant material selected, shall be submitted by the applicant for approval by the planning and zoning director. 
(2)  A licensed master plumber, licensed sprinkler/irrigation contractor, or owner/builder with a valid village occupational license, pursuant to a valid and current village permit, shall install all irrigation systems. 
(3)  Irrigation systems shall be installed and at all times maintained so as to minimize spray upon any public access sidewalk, street, or abutting property. 
(4)  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the community development department, a complete set of as-built irrigation plans shall be submitted and approved by said department. 
(5)  The use of irrigation quality (IQ) effluent water (gray or reused water) shall be encouraged for irrigation purposes where such use may be deemed practical and where such water is available to a site and where such reuse is approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. 
(6)  The use of artificial or inorganic plant material (plastic, fabric, etc.) to meet the requirements of this chapter is prohibited, including the use of artificial turf and/or ground cover. 
(7)  After April 4, 2002, new installations of automatic irrigation systems shall be equipped with a water sensing device which will automatically discontinue irrigation during periods of rainfall and such devices must operate and be maintained accordingly. See also section 24-64.

(Ord. No. 860, § 1, 12-15-11) 
Sec. 15-148. - Findings. 
    As a result of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's determination that certain water bodies within Palm Beach County are impaired for excessive nutrient levels, the Village Council of the Village of Royal Palm Beach finds that the best management practices contained in the most recent edition of the "Florida-Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green Industries," are required in this division. 
(Ord. No. 860, § 1, 12-15-11) 
Sec. 15-149. - Purpose and intent. 
    This division regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and licensing requirements; establishes a prohibited application period; and specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods, fertilizer-free zones, and exemptions. This division requires the use of best management practices to minimize negative environmental effects associated with excessive nutrients in our water bodies. These environmental effects have been observed in and on Palm Beach County's natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, lakes, estuaries and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset important to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of Palm Beach County residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, is anticipated to help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

(Ord. No. 860, § 1, 12-15-11) 
Sec. 15-154. - Fertilizer application practices. 
(a)  As required in section 15-152 of this division, spreader deflector shields shall be used when fertilizing via rotary (broadcast) spreaders. Deflectors must be positioned such that fertilizer granules are deflected away from all impervious surfaces, fertilizer-free zones and water bodies, including wetlands.

(Ord. No. 417, § 2, 11-21-91; Ord. No. 522, § 1, 3-20-97; Ord. No. 613, § 1, 9-6-01; Ord. No. 785, § 1, 5-3-07; Ord. No. 817, § 1, 3-5-09; Ord. No. 949, § 2, 2-2-17) 
Sec. 20-2. - Purpose and scope of regulations. 
(a)  In general. The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communications in the village; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the village's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; to foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations. Additionally, this chapter provides for regulations to achieve the following: 
(1)  Property value protection. Signs should not create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, brightness or movement. They should be in harmony with buildings, the neighborhood and other conforming signs in the area. 
(2)  Communication. Signs should deny other persons or groups the use of sight lines on public rights-of-way, should not obscure important public messages and should not overwhelm readers with too many messages. Signs can and should help individuals to identify and understand the jurisdiction and the character of its subareas. 
(3)  Preservation of [the] community's beauty. Villages such as this which include commercial development as well as small office, retail, residential and industrial uses rely heavily on their natural surroundings and beautification efforts to retain their economic viability.

The purpose and intent of this section is to encourage applicants to design master signage plans for nonresidential signage that are innovative, creative, and utilize planning, design, and architectural concepts to enhance vehicular and pedestrian safety, and the aesthetics of the village. 
(3)  Waivers permitted . The planning and zoning commission may grant a waiver from the master signage plan requirements based on the following: 
a.  A development application on village-approved forms that meets the requirements of section 26-32, and includes a written statement supplied by the applicant specifying: the section of the master signage plan for which a waiver is requested; the precise extent of said waiver; and the reasons substantiating the request for waiver.

3.  The proposed signage provides for a greater pedestrian experience;

5.  The proposed signage does not require a variance. If a variance is required, a variance must first be obtained in accordance with village code prior to approval of a waiver to the master signage plan being approved. 
(4)  A waiver to a master signage plan granted under this section does not run with the land. A waiver is particular only to the approved sign and shall not be transferred or applied to another sign. Further, a waiver shall become null and void if the approved sign is removed at a particular location.

Secs. 21.7-1-21.7-24. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - RIGHT-OF-WAY REGULATIONS 
DIVISION 1. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 21.7-25 - Title. 
    This article shall be known as "The Village of Royal Palm Beach Communications Facilities in the Public Rights-of-way Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 969, § 1, 3-1-18) 
Sec. 21.7-26. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the village to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by providing regulations governing the placement and maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the village. The purpose of this article is: 
(a)  To establish a competitively neutral policy for the use of the village's public rights-of-way by all communications services providers, including both wireless communications providers and wireline communications providers, as well as communications facilities providers, wireless infrastructure providers, and pass-through providers, for the placement and maintenance of communications facilities, including wireless communications facilities, and the provision of communications services, including wireless communications services and other utilities, including but not limited to, those defined in F.S. § 337.401, as same may be amended from time to time; and 
(b)  To regulate the placement and maintenance of communications facilities, including wireless communications facilities in the village's public rights-of-way and minimize disruption to the village's public rights-of-way, pursuant to its governmental powers as set forth at F.S. ch. 166, as same may be amended from time to time, including the encouraging of co-location and re-purposing existing facilities and structures; and 
(c)  To prescribe reasonable rules pursuant to F.S. § 337.401, the Federal Communications Act of 1934, including without limitation Sections 332 and 253, Section 6409(a) of 47 USC § 1455(a) and Orders issued by the FCC, as each may be amended from time to time, and other federal and state law so as to minimize disruption of services in the village's public rights-of-way, regulate the use of the village's public rights-of-way by both wireless communications providers and wireline communications providers, as well as communications facilities providers, wireless infrastructure providers and pass-through providers, and to regulate the placement and maintenance of communications facilities, including wireless communications facilities, in the village's public rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 969, § 1, 3-1-18) 
Sec. 21.7-27. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given. Where not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the plural number. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Words not otherwise defined shall be construed to have their common and ordinary meaning. 
    Abandonment or abandoned means two hundred seventy (270) or more consecutive days with the absence of any active communications service provider on a communications facility. Abandoned communications facilities shall be removed or cured as required by this article. This term shall not include cessation of all use of a communications facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used for some purpose or use accessory to the communications facility. For example, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used as referenced above, shall not be "abandonment" of a communications facility. notwithstanding the foregoing example, if the communications facility is attached to an existing structure that has an independent function, such as a utility pole or the like, said abandonment of the communications facility requires removal of the communications facility only and does not require the removal of the existing structure. The term shall also exclude the temporary cessation of the provision of communications services where the provider intends to re-establish the provision of communications services in the future. For example, cable drops to homes that are deactivated based on competitive alternatives, but are maintained for when the customer re-activates service shall not be "abandonment" of a communications facility. The temporary cessation with intent to re-activate must be documented to the satisfaction of the village engineer.

(Code 1967, § 20-17; Ord. No. 271, § 1, 12-17-87) 
Sec. 22-45. - General street location and arrangement. 
(a)  The street layout of the subdivision shall be in conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of the entire neighboring area. Residential subdivision shall be designed so that all individual lots within the proposed subdivision shall have access to minor streets on a street system internal to the subdivision and not be permitted access to major arterial or collector streets abutting the subdivision or internal to the subdivision. All proposed streets shall provide satisfactory alignment for continuation of existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. All proposed streets shall provide satisfactory alignment for continuation of existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. 
(b)  Where a proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, it shall be planned so as to avoid having residential lots front on a street which runs parallel and adjacent to the railroad right-of-way. 
(c)  Where a proposed residential subdivision contains or is adjacent to a major arterial street, it shall be planned, where reasonably possible, so as to avoid having lots fronting on the arterial in such a manner as to derive their access from the arterial preferably by providing a marginal access street for these lots or by designing the subdivision so that access is obtained from minor interior streets. In cases where lots back up to major arterial streets, the lots shall be separated from the arterial street by a landscape buffer of not less than twenty-five (25) feet which may be conveyed as part of the lot appropriate landscape easements or may be created as a separate landscape buffer tract. 
(d)  Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient. 
(e)  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the land included in the subdivision submitted for approval, when extension is required to provide for normal circulation of traffic within the vicinity. 
(f)  Street jogs, or centerline offsets in the horizontal alignment of streets across intersections of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be prohibited. 
(g)  The centerline of no more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty (60) degrees. Curved streets shall have a minimum tangent of one hundred (100) feet at intersections. 
(h)  New street entrances on roads designated or classified as major arterials shall be not less than one thousand seven hundred (1,700) feet apart and new street entrances on roads designated or classified as collector streets shall not be less than five hundred (500) feet apart. Provided, however, that the village council may reduce these requirements if it determines that such action will not be contrary to the purposes of this chapter. 
(i)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the village council may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service lanes, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(j)  Dead-end streets, designed as such permanently, shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of not less than eighty (80) feet and a right-of-way diameter of not less than one hundred (100) feet. 
(k)  Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround area which shall meet the requirements of the planning and zoning commission for design, maintenance and removal. 
(l)  Half streets shall not be permitted within a subdivision. 
(m)  Minor streets within subdivisions shall be so laid out and designed that their use by through traffic and speeding traffic will be discouraged. 
(n)  All streets within a subdivision hereafter established shall be named. No name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with existing street names, and all names shall be approved by the village council. 
(o)  A proposed subdivision that includes a platted street that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of these regulations shall provide for the dedication of additional right-of-way along either one or both sides of such street so that the minimum right-of-way required by these regulations can be established. If the proposed subdivision abuts only one side of such street, then a minimum of one-half of the required extra right-of-way shall be dedicated or reserved by such subdivision. 
(p)  Whenever the village council finds that street access to adjoining property is needed, a street right-of-way shall be extended to the boundary of such property and such right-of-way shall be dedicated to the public as an unopened street. When such unopened street is required for access to property, then the developer of the property for which access is required shall be responsible for opening and improving the unopened street. 
(q)  Street name markers which meet village specifications shall be installed at all street intersections. 
(r)  A tangent of at least one hundred feet shall be introduced between reverse cures on major, collector and minor streets. 
(s)  Alleys shall be provided to serve multiple dwellings, business, commercial and industrial areas, except if this requirement is waived. The village council may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses permissible on the property. The width of an alley shall be twenty (20) feet or more. Changes in alignment of alleys shall be made on a centerline radius of not less than fifty (50) feet. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities for service trucks at the dead-end, with a minimum external diameter of one hundred (100) feet. 
(t)  Cul-de-sacs, permanently designed as such, shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length or longer if approved by village engineer and shall be provided at the closed end (cul-de-sac) with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least eighty (80) feet and a property line diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet. 
(u)  Private streets shall be prohibited. This requirement may not apply to shopping centers, industrial districts, apartment projects and other developments under single ownership. In such cases, the owner shall be responsible for construction, maintenance and control. 
(v)  Curvilinear streets are recommended for residential, minor and collector streets in order to discourage excessive vehicular speeds and to provide attractive vistas. Whenever a street changes direction or connecting street lines deflect from each other by more than ten (10) degrees, there shall be horizontal curve. To ensure adequate sight distance, minimum centerline radii for horizontal curves shall be as follows: 
(1)  Minor streets: Two hundred fifty (250) feet. 
(2)  Collector streets: Five hundred (500) feet. 
(3)  Major arterial streets: Seven hundred fifty (750) feet. 
(w)  The grades on all streets shall conform to the following requirements: 
(1)  Maximum grade: Eight (8) percent. 
(2)  Minimum grade: Two-tenths (0.2) of one percent.

(b)  Parks and playgrounds shall be dedicated to the public, deeded to the village, or reserved for private use under private ownership. If deeded to the village, the land shall be used by the village for recreational needs reasonably attributable to the proposed subdivision. 
(c)  The size and location of such parks and playgrounds are subject to the approval of the village council. 
(d)  Where a site for public school buildings is within the scope of a comprehensive plan, and deemed suitable by the village council and the county school board for location in a subdivision, such site may be reserved for public use for educational purposes reasonably attributable to the proposed subdivision. The subdivider shall allow a period of ninety (90) days from the date of submittal of the preliminary plat, during which time the county school board shall be required to make known its intention to acquire such site. If the school board indicates a desire to acquire the site, the village council may then set a period of time, upon consultation with the subdivider and the school board, for acquisition of such a site. 
(e)  Where the proposed subdivision is too small to provide space of suitable size for public open spaces, the open space provided may be combined with that provided or to be provided in adjoining areas. Thus, in the aggregate, there will be provided an open space of suitable size for the purpose intended. 
(f)  Existing features which are assets to the community and subdivision area should be preserved in every way possible through ingenuity in the design of the subdivision. Examples of such features are specimen trees, groves, waterways, scenic points, community landmarks, vacant historical ground, historical buildings and similar irreplaceable physical assets.

c.  In multi-family, commercial, institutional, industrial or other high daytime or nighttime population density developments, a distribution system capable of delivering, in addition to domestic requirements at residual pressures of not less than twenty (20) pounds per square inch, fire flows of at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) gallons per minute shall be provided as a minimum standard; fire hydrants or connections therefor shall be spaced no greater than four hundred (400) feet apart on mains no less than six (6) inches in diameter; and provided to such an extent, that the minimum fire flow will be maintained for at least four (4) hours. 
(2)  Sanitary sewer system. 
a.  When a subdivision is located within or adjacent to the service area of a public sewage system, sanitary sewers and other required appurtenances thereto shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots with connections to the public sewer system. In a proposed subdivision which cannot feasibly connect with an existing public sewer system, a subdivision sewer may be required for the subdivision if feasible in the judgment of the village council, with the advice of the village engineer and in accordance with the policies and requirements of the county health department and the state department of environmental regulation. 
b.  Where it is determined in the judgment of the village council, with the advice of the village engineer and the state department of environmental regulation, that a subdivision cannot be economically connected with an existing public sewer system or be required to provide a public sewer system for the subdivision itself, then a subdivider may install an approved private sewage disposal system in accordance with the requirements of the village and the county health department. 
(3)  Installation of public utilities and driveways.

The village engineer may require, at his discretion, tests and measurements which he deems necessary. 
(d)  Completion certificate: 
(1)  The required improvements shall not be considered complete until a completion certificate along with the final project records have been furnished to, reviewed and approved by the village engineer. The certificate shall be by the developer's engineer stating that the required improvements were installed under his responsible direction and that the improvements conform with the approved construction plans and this chapter. The developer's engineer shall also provide electronic copies of plans, AutoCAD files, GIS data, and other necessary records in the format specified by the village engineer. 
(2)  If, after a completion certificate has been filed with the village engineer, it is found that the improvements have not been installed in accord with these regulations, and the village engineer by affidavit so states, and further work must be performed by the developer to conform with these regulations, then, in that event, the developer shall pay for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the village. The costs and expenses shall be calculated on a dollar-value per hour. The village engineer shall in no event perform any service or do any act where he files an affidavit, unless an estimate of costs for services to be performed shall first have been delivered to the developer, and the developer accepts the liability to pay for the services performed by the village engineer. 
(e)  Acceptance and maintenance of required improvements. 
(1)  The dedication of public space, parks, rights-of-way, easements or the like on the plat shall not constitute an acceptance of the dedication by the village. The acceptance of the dedication shall be indicated by a resolution of the council adopted at such time as all improvements meet or exceed the standard set forth in this chapter. The village engineer, upon satisfactory completion of required improvements, shall certify to the village council that the developer has complied with all of the provisions of this chapter and shall recommend to the council the acceptance of the dedications and when applicable, the maintenance of the required improvements. Upon such recommendations, the council by resolution shall approve the subdivision, the dedications on the plat and the maintenance responsibilities of the required improvements. 
(2)  Upon the completion of required improvements and approval of the same by the village engineer, the required improvements may be accepted by adoption of a resolution of the village council, subject to a maintenance bond, letter or credit, or other surety reviewed and approved by the village engineer and the village attorney, ensuring the maintenance of all required improvements approved and accepted by the village, for a period of one (1) year following the date of the adoption of the resolution by the village council accepting plat dedications and required improvements. The surety amount shall be ten (10) percent of the construction costs of required improvements, and the energy costs (electrical or otherwise) for street and/or right-of-way illumination, as certified by the developer's engineer. The surety required herein shall be released or terminated only upon approval by the village engineer, authorizing such release or termination.

The land to be dedicated to the village or the fee to be paid in lieu thereof or both shall be a condition of preliminary plat approval as recommended by the planning and zoning commission, and agreed to by the village council, and further shall be a condition of final plat approval as agreed to by the village council. The village council shall determine whether it accepts land dedication, elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or both, pursuant to the criteria outlined in section 22-55(h) below. At the time of issuance of the first building permit for the residential development, the residential developer shall dedicate the land, pay the fees as previously determined by the village council, or furnish a bond naming the village as beneficiary in the amount of one hundred ten (110) percent of the fees which shall become a lien upon the property and shall be paid upon issuance of the first certificate of occupancy or the transfer of title to any parcel or unit of the land or improvements thereto. 
(2)  Acceptance and maintenance of required improvements. 
a.  The dedication of land to the village under this section shall not constitute an acceptance of the dedication by the village. The acceptance of the dedication shall be by a resolution of the village council adopted at such time as all improvements meet or exceed the standards set forth in section 22-50 of Village Code. The village engineer, upon satisfactory completion of required improvements, shall certify to the village council that the developer has complied with the provisions of section 22-50 and shall recommend to the village council the acceptance of the dedications and when applicable, the maintenance of the required improvements. Upon such recommendations, the village council by resolution shall accept the dedications, and approve the maintenance responsibilities of the required improvements. 
b.  Upon the completion of required improvements and approval of the same by the village engineer, the required improvements may be accepted by adoption of a resolution of the village council, subject to a maintenance bond, letter or credit, or other surety reviewed and approved by the village engineer and the village attorney, ensuring the maintenance of all required improvements approved and accepted by the village, for a period of one (1) year following the date of the adoption of the resolution by the village council accepting the dedications and required improvements. The surety amount shall be ten (10) percent of the construction costs of required improvements, and the energy costs (electrical or otherwise) for street and/or right-of-way illumination, as certified by the developer's engineer. The surety required herein shall be released or terminated only upon the adoption by village council of a resolution, as recommended by the village engineer, authorizing such release or termination. 
(f)  General standard. It is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that ten (10) acres of property for every one thousand (1,000) persons be devoted for local park and recreational purposes. 
(g)  Formula for dedication of land. To determine park and recreational land for residential developments to be dedicated in accordance with the general standard of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons, the following formula shall be used: 
(1)  For single family developments, the average number of persons per dwelling unit equals three (3); multiply this by the number of dwelling units proposed to arrive at the projected number of persons for the project; divide this number by one thousand (1,000); multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons. 
(2)  For multi-family and mobile home facility developments, the average number of persons per dwelling unit equal two and one-half (2.5); multiply this by the number of dwelling units proposed to arrive at the projected number of persons for the project; divide this number by one thousand (1,000); multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons. 
(3)  For senior housing facility, congregate care facility, assisted living facility, and nursing home facility developments, the number of persons shall be determined by the maximum number of occupants based on the approved site plan for the facility; divide this number by one thousand (1,000); multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons. 
(h)  Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication. 
(1)  General formula. If it is determined by the village council that no park or recreation facility is to be located in whole or part within the proposed residential development to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, then the residential developer shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of the land acreage determined by the formula in section 22-55(g) above, and in an amount determined in accordance with section 22-55(h)(3) below, such fee to be used by the village for acquisition or development of park and recreational land which will serve the residents of the area being developed. 
(2)  Determination of land or fee. The village council shall determine whether to accept land dedication or elect to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof by consideration of the following: 
a.  Topography, geology, access and location of land in the development available for dedication; 
b.  Size and shape of the development and land available for dedication; 
c.  The feasibility of dedication; 
d.  Availability of previously acquired park property; 
e.  Conformity with the recreation and open space element of the comprehensive plan; 
f.  If fifty (50) percent of the land required to be dedicated to the village is provided as private open space/facilities for park and recreational purposes within a proposed residential development so that a credit would be given in accordance with section 22-55(h)(5) below, and the remaining fifty (50) percent of land required to be dedicated to the village is less than three (3) acres in size, then the residential developer shall be required to pay a fee in lieu of land dedication for the land that is less than three (3) acres in size; and 
g.  If fifty (50) percent of the land required to be dedicated to the village is provided as private open space/facilities for park and recreational purposes within a proposed residential development so that a credit would be given in accordance with section 22-55(h)(5) below, and the remaining fifty (50) percent of land required to be dedicated to the village is ten (10) acres or more in size, then the residential developer shall be required to dedicate the land that is ten (10) acres or more in size to the village. No fees in lieu of dedication shall be accepted. 
(3)  Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication. Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication either in whole or in part, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated pursuant to the formula prescribed above. The fee shall be paid pursuant to the provisions contained in this section. Fair market value of the land shall be determined by: 
a.  An appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser approved by the village. Such appraisal shall be obtained at the residential developer's own expense and such appraisal shall value the land based on the highest and best use in the applicable zoning district; or 
b.  The contract purchase price of the land so long as proof of purchase price is provided to the village in a form acceptable to the village, and the sale/purchase of the property did not occur more than two (2) years prior to the determination by the village council of the amount of the fee to be paid in lieu of land dedication. 
(4)  Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee. The residential developer shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the following formula: 
a.  When only a portion of the land calculated by the formula for park and recreational use is to be dedicated, such portion shall be dedicated for local park or recreational purposes, and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions set out above shall be paid for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to the above provisions. 
b.  When sufficient park and recreational land in the vicinity has already been acquired by the village and only a small portion of land is needed from the residential development to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated, and a fee computed pursuant to the formula provided above shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated, such fees to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreational facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreational facilities in the area serving the subdivision. 
(5)  Credit for private open space. Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed residential development, partial credit, not to exceed fifty (50) percent, may be given against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the village council finds it is in the public interest to do so, and further finds that all of the following standards are met: 
a.  The yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space for purposes of determined credits under this section; and 
b.  For residential developments where units are owned in fee simple (e.g., single-family, townhome, condominium units), the private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon shall be restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant which shall run with the land in favor of the existing or future residents, and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the village. Further, the private open space and recreation facilities placed thereon shall be privately owned and maintained by the existing or future residents of the development as common property. Private ownership and maintenance by the existing or future residents shall be adequately provided for by a recorded written homeowners association or property owners association declaration of covenants and restrictions, or other unity of control document that is acceptable to and approved by the village attorney prior to issuance of a development order or building permits to construct the residential units. The residential developer, and its successors and assigns, shall not be permitted to sell, transfer or convey the private open space for which credit is given or the recreational facilities placed thereon to a third party that is not the homeowners association or property owners association owned and controlled by the existing or future residents of the development. The residential developer, and its successors and assigns, shall transfer ownership of the private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon to the homeowners association or property owners association at the time of developer turnover or at some earlier date agreed to by the village. The private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon shall not be made open and available for the general public (e.g., public clubhouse, public pool); and 
c.  For residential developments under single ownership (e.g., apartment complex), the private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon shall be restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant or condition of approval which shall run with the land in favor of the existing or future residents, and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the village. Further, the private open space and recreation facilities placed thereon shall be privately owned and maintained by the single owner for the benefit of the existing or future residents of the development. The private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon shall not be made open and available for the general public (e.g., public clubhouse, public pool); and 
d.  The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and locations; and 
e.  Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreation and open space element of the comprehensive plan; and 
f.  The open space for which credit is given provides a minimum of five (5) of the local park basic requirements listed below or a combination of such and other recreational improvements that will meet the specific recreation park needs of the future residents of the area: 
1.  The following is a list of facilities that will satisfy the local park basic requirements of this section, and Palm Beach County's adopted standards for each facility. These standards will indicate what portion of the population will be served by each respective facility.

Said monies, as they relate to fees paid for any given residential development, shall be used first for the purpose of providing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the development by way of the purchase of necessary land; or if the village council deems that there is sufficient land available for that development, then, secondly, said monies shall be used for improving said land for park and recreational purposes. If both adequate land and improvements exist in the area, the monies may be spent to acquire or improve park and recreational facilities needed in the village. 
(i)  Appeals. Any person, firm or corporation claiming to be injured or aggrieved by final action of the village council under this section may present to the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County a petition for writ of certiorari to review such final action, as provided for under the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.

ARTICLE IV. - ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 22-66. - Variances. 
(a)  Higher standards may be required. These subdivision regulations have been adopted only as minimum requirements. The developer should be encouraged to exceed the requirements of these regulations, and the village council may require design standards above the minimum standards contained herein, whenever it finds that the public health, safety, or general welfare justifies imposition of such increased standards. 
(b)  Reduced standards or variances may be permitted. The village council, after receipt of recommendations from the planning and zoning commission, may reduce or otherwise vary the terms of these regulations whenever such variance will not be contrary to the public interest and owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in exceptional and undue hardship. No such variance shall be granted if it has the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations. 
(c)  General application requirements and review standards. The developer is required to submit a written application for a variance that meets the requirements of section 26-32(e). Additionally, the developer is required to submit a written justification statement that outlines the basis of the request and the reasons why it should be approved. This justification statement must address the following criteria which will be considered by the planning and zoning commission in making its recommendations to the village council, and the village council when making its final decision to approve the application, approve the application with conditions, deny the application, or return the application to the technical staff or the planning and zoning commission for further deliberation and recommendations, as is appropriate for that application: 
(1)  That exceptional and unique conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structures or required subdivision improvements involved and which are not applicable to other land, structures or required subdivision improvements; 
(2)  That strict compliance with the provisions of the regulations would deprive the developer of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties, subject to these regulations, with similar conditions; 
(3)  That the exceptional and unique conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the developer; 
(4)  That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the developer any special privilege that is denied by the regulations of other lands, structures or required subdivision improvements under similar conditions. No preexisting conditions on neighboring lands which are contrary to the regulations established in this chapter shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance; 
(5)  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the developer of the rights commonly enjoyed by other lands or structures subject to these regulations and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the developer; 
(6)  That the variance to be granted is the minimum variance that would make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or other improvements; 
(7)  That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter; and 
(8)  That the grant of the variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare. 
(d)  Hearing schedules and due public notice. The scheduling of public hearings before the planning and zoning commission and the village council, and due public notice for such hearings, shall be as set forth in section 26-32(d). 
(e)  Conditions. The village council may add any conditions of approval deemed necessary by the council to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the public. Violations of any or all conditions of approval may subject the applicant, owner, his agent, lessee, tenant, contractor or any person using the building, structure, land, property or premises to the enforcement remedies and penalties outlined in section 22-67. 
(f)  Appeals. Any person, firm or corporation claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any final action of the village council under this section may present to the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County a petition for a writ of certiorari to review such final action, as provided for under the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the date of such final action of the village council appealed from. Final action shall not include any recommendations made by the planning and zoning commission to the village council. 
(g)  Duty to commence in timely manner; extensions. A variance granted under the provisions of this chapter shall automatically lapse if the variance is not utilized within one (1) year from date such variance was granted by the village council. The village council may grant two (2) time extensions of the variance for a period not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months upon the submittal of a request for extension by the applicant on forms prescribed by the village prior to the expiration of the initial one-year period or prior to the expiration date of a first extension request.

The village may revoke a building permit or certificate of occupancy in those cases in which an administrative determination has been made that false statements or misrepresentations existed as to material fact(s) in the application or plans upon which the permit or approval was based, or in those cases in which an administrative determination has been made that a property owner, his agent, lessee, tenant, contractor or any person using the building, structure, land, property or premises has failed to comply with a cease and desist order issued by the building official. 
c.  Suspension. The village may suspend a building permit or certificate of occupancy where an administrative determination has been made that an error or omission, attributable to either the permit applicant or the village, existed in the issuance of the permit or certificate approval, or in those cases in which an administrative determination has been made that a property owner, his agent, lessee, tenant, contractor or any person using the building, structure, land, property or premises has failed to comply with a cease and desist order issued by the building official. 
A valid permit or certificate shall be issued in place of the incorrect permit or certificate after correction of the error or omission. 
d.  Notice and administrative appeal. All decisions concerning the issuance, revocation or suspension of building permits and certificates of occupancy shall be stated in a written official notice to the permit applicant, and the owner if different from the permit applicant. Any administrative decision may be appealed to the village council with a recommendation from the board of adjustment.

Sec. 23-53. - Variances and appeals. 
(a)  Variances. 
(1)  The village council may, with recommendations from the planning and zoning commission, authorize upon application such variance from the off-street parking and loading facilities requirements that will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of these requirements will result in unnecessary and undue hardship. In order to authorize any variance from the off-street parking and loading facilities requirements, the Village Council must and shall find that: 
a.  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved, and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings subject to similar requirements; 
b.  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
c.  Granting the variance request will not confer on the applicant any special privileges that are denied by this Code to other lands, buildings or structures similarly situated; 
d.  A literal interpretation of the provisions in this Code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties similarly situated under the terms of this Code and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant; 
e.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure; 
f.  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this division; 
g.  Such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare. 
(2)  In granting any variance, the village council may prescribe appropriate safeguards and conditions in conformity with the Village Code. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of the Village Code. 
(3)  Financial hardship alone is insufficient evidence of hardship in determining a grant of variance. 
(4)  Lapsing of variance. A variance granted under the provision of this division shall automatically lapse if construction, in accordance with the plans for which such variances were granted, has not been initiated within one (1) year from the date of granting such variance by the village council or, if judicial proceedings to review the decision of the village council shall be instituted, then from the date of entry of the final order in such proceedings, including all appeals. The village council may grant two (2) time extensions of the variance for a period not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months upon the submittal of a request for extension by the applicant in forms prescribed by the village prior to the expiration of the initial one-year period. 
(5)  The fee required for submitting an application for variance shall be in an amount as set by resolution of the village council. 
(b)  Appeals from decisions of administrative officials. 
(1)  The village council may, with recommendations from the planning and zoning commission hear and act on any and all appeals taken from the requirement, decision or determination made by the director or any administrative official charged with the enforcement of any requirement set forth in this division. The appeal shall specify the grounds thereof and shall be filed within such time and in such form as may be described by the director by general rule. 
(2)  The administrative official from whom the appeal is taken shall, upon the notification of the filing of the appeal, forthwith transmit to the village council and to the planning and zoning commission all documents and plans constituting the record of the action from which the appeal was taken. 
(3)  Application; notice; hearing. The application, notice and hearing shall be filed and conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in subsections 26-32(a) and 26-32(d) of the Village Code of Ordinances. The fee required for submitting an application for an administrative appeal shall be in an amount as set by resolutions of the village council.

Secs. 24-11-24-20. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY 

Sec. 24-21. - Intent. 
    It is the intent of this article that the village will establish stormwater management as a village utility enterprise in accordance with F.S. § 403.0893 and shall establish a program of user charges for stormwater management service to be charged to all developed property within the village that contributes stormwater runoff to the village's stormwater management systems to accomplish the functions of such utility. These functions include, but are not limited to, maintenance, planning, design, construction, regulation, surveying, and inspection as they relate to stormwater management facilities of the village. 
(Ord. No. 864, § 1, 4-19-12) 
Sec. 24-22. - Findings. 
    The village finds and determines that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health, safety, and welfare of the village community. Further, village finds as follows: 
(a)  Stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into receiving bodies, thereby degrading water quality; 
(b)  The increase in nutrients, such as phosphorous and nitrogen, resulting from stormwater runoff accelerates eutrophication of receiving water bodies and adversely affecting flora and fauna; 
(c)  Improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff and increases erosion and sedimentation; 
(d)  Construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion; 
(e)  Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases the capacity of water bodies to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation, and harms flora and fauna; 
(f)  Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of storm water runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge; 
(g)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidence and intensity of flooding, which endangers property and human welfare; 
(h)  Substantial economical losses may result from adverse impacts upon the waters of the village ecosystem; 
(i)  Village has an existing stormwater management program, through which it administers various stormwater management functions and maintains a system of storm and surface water management facilities including, but not limited to, conduits, manholes, channels, ditches, waterways, drainage easements, retention and detention basins, infiltration facilities, and other components; 
(j)  The existing stormwater system in village requires regular maintenance and improvements; 
(k)  Due to the age of existing infrastructure, rehabilitation and replacement of some portions of the existing stormwater system and implementation of new stormwater systems are required; 
(l)  All developed property in village either uses or benefits from the village's administration of the its stormwater management program; 
(m)  The extent of use of the stormwater program by each property depends upon factors, such as land use and the amount of impervious surface on the property, which influence runoff; 
(n)  The costs of administration of the village's stormwater program should be allocated, to the extent practicable, to all customers based in part on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of their property on the stormwater system; and 
(o)  Management of the village's stormwater program to protect the public health, safety, and welfare requires adequate revenues, and it is in the interest of the public to finance stormwater management adequately with a reasonable and equitable user fee system so each user of the program pays to the extent to which the user contributes to the need for the stormwater program.

(Ord. No. 220, § 102, 5-20-86) 
Sec. 26-3. - Authority. 
    This chapter is adopted pursuant to Article VIII, section 2, of the Florida Constitution, section 166.011 et seq., Florida Statutes, and section 163.3161 et seq., Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 220, § 103, 5-20-86) 
Sec. 26-4. - Effect of the comprehensive plan; school concurrency management system; exceptions. 
(a)  Effect and intent. This chapter shall be interpreted and applied in all instances in a manner that is consistent with, and implements, the comprehensive plan. It is the intent of the chapter to ensure that adequate potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, stormwater management, park, road, public school facilities, mass transit public facilities, and fire-rescue public facilities are available to accommodate development concurrent with the impact of development on such public facilities, consistent with the LOS standards for those public facilities adopted in the comprehensive plan. The policies adopted in the comprehensive plan shall serve as a framework and guideline for decisions by the village council, the planning and zoning commission, the board of zoning adjustment, the director, and all other municipal boards, commissions and agents as may be empowered to administer or apply the terms of this chapter from time to time. All actions taken in regard to amendments to the zoning map, amendments to the text of this chapter, applications for development orders or site-specific development orders, petitions for annexation or deannexation, and any other application filed pursuant to [or] subject to this chapter shall be consistent with all policies and provisions of the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  LOS for public schools. The following definition, level of service (LOS) standards shall apply to the review of public school facilities. 
    LOS for public schools means the following for public school facilities: To ensure the capacity of schools is sufficient to support student growth at the adopted level of services for each year of the five-year planning period and through the longterm planning period for each concurrency service area ("CSA"), the school concurrency agreement established LOS as set forth below. The actual LOS for each type of school in each CSA shall be established each year in each CSA by the first student count of the second semester. 
(1)  Tiered levels of service shall be in force pursuant to the tiered level of service table in the public school facilities element until August 1, 2004. Individual schools of each type may exceed the tiered LOS during the period in which tiered LOS are in effect, provided that the CSA's tiered LOS is not exceeded. However, each individual school's LOS which exceeds the tiered LOS, during the time that the tiered LOS is in effect, shall not exceed the utilization standards for that school type as shown in the maximum utilization table of the public school facilities element. During the time that the tiered level of service standard is in effect, the school district shall initiate necessary program and/or boundary adjustments so that the tiered LOS is not exceeded in each CSA. 
(2)  After August 1, 2004, the following LOS standards shall be established for all schools of each type within each CSA and each individual school: a.) one hundred ten (110) percent of capacity (utilization) as determined by the Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH); or b.) a higher LOS up to one hundred twenty (120) percent of FISH capacity (utilization/LOS) for individual schools subject to the results of a school capacity study (SCS) undertaken by the technical advisory group (TAG), in consultation with all local governments with jurisdiction within the CSA and the school district to determine if a particular school can operate in excess of one hundred ten (110) percent capacity. The SCS shall be required if a school in the first student count of the second semester reaches one hundred eight (108) percent or above of FISH capacity, once the level of service above is achieved. If the SCS concludes that the school can operate within the FISH guidelines and not exceed one hundred twenty (120) percent LOS, then that school shall be considered to operate within the adopted LOS and the CSA LOS shall be amended. 
(3)  School concurrency shall be measured and applied on the basis of twenty-one (21) CSAs as described in the public school facilities element. In determining whether capacity is available, the school district shall consider any new capacity which will be in place or under actual construction in the first three (3) years of the school district five-year capital facilities plan. In determining whether capacity is available, the school district shall consider adjacent CSA capacity as specified in the school concurrency agreement. 
(4)  These standards shall not apply to proposed new residential development until the commencement of the school concurrency program as specified in article V, section A of the agreement. 
(c)  Exempted development orders. The following applications for development orders are exempted from the LOS for public school facilities: 
(1)  In the event termination or suspension of the school concurrency program occurs as set forth in the school concurrency agreement. 
(2)  Single-family lots of record, existing as such at the time this section is adopted. 
(3)  Any residential development that received final approval of a site-specific development order prior to the commencement of the school concurrency program, as specified in article V, section A of the school concurrency agreement, or is exempt from concurrency under a local government's concurrency regulations is considered vested for that which was previously approved and shall not be considered as proposed new residential development for purposes of school concurrency. Any residential development which is exempt from school concurrency under the village's concurrency regulations shall not be considered as new residential development for purposes of school concurrency. 
(4)  Any new residential development that has filed a complete application for a site-specific development order or any amendment to previously approved development order pending prior to the commencement of the school concurrency program, as specified in article V, section A of the school concurrency agreement. 
(5)  Any residential development which is restricted to elderly and meets the requirements under the Federal Fair Housing Act to be designated as an adults-only community. 
(6)  Any amendment to any previously approved residential development which does not increase the density of the development. 
(7)  Any previously approved residential development or any other previously approved development with a residential component located within any existing "transportation concurrency exception area," as defined in section 163.3180(5), Florida Statutes.

Sec. 26-5. - Applicability. 
    This chapter shall apply to all buildings and the use of land throughout the village. Existing buildings and uses which are inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be permitted subject to the requirements imposed upon nonconforming uses and buildings in this chapter. All applications filed pursuant to this chapter shall be required to meet the requirements of this chapter which are in effect on the date of final decision on the application. 
(Ord. No. 220, § 105, 5-20-86) 
Sec. 26-6. - Prohibition of inconsistent use or development of land or structures; public school facilities concurrency approval. 
(a)  General concurrency required. It shall be unlawful for any person to carry out any development or use of real property in the village which is inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter and the comprehensive plan. The village shall coordinate the timing, provision and funding of potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, park and recreation, road mass transit, public school facilities and fire-rescue public facilities to maintain the LOS for such public facilities as adopted in the village's comprehensive plan and shall ensure that no development orders are issued unless the following conditions are met: either there are adequate public facilities available to serve the proposed development concurrent with the impacts of such development on the public facilities; or the development orders issued are conditioned upon the availability of public services concurrent with the impacts of such development on public facilities. The following types of development orders shall be reviewed for concurrency as follows: 
Type of Development 
Order Concurrency Review 
Performed by Timeframe for 
Concurrency Review Variance Technical Staff Review Process "TSR" During usual review process prior to recommendation of planning and zoning commission for village council action Plat TSR Same as above Special exception TSR Same as above Subdivision of land (previously platted) TSR Same as above PUD/PCD/PID TSR Same as above Rezoning TSR Same as above Permitted use with no further review required Building official Upon application for building permit  
(b)  Public school concurrency procedures. 
(1)  At the time of and in conjunction with the application for an adequate public facilities review in accordance with the Village of Royal Palm Beach's Zoning Code, the applicant for a proposed new residential development shall submit to the Village of Royal Palm Beach a request for a school concurrency determination. 
(2)  The village shall review the application for completeness and require the applicant to submit the school concurrency application to the school district within ten (10) days of finding the application complete. The applicable, nonrefundable application fee payable to the school district in accordance with the fee schedule set by the school district shall accompany the application. 
(3)  The school concurrency application shall contain the following information: location of the development; the build-out time frame of the development; and the number, type, and size of all the residential units anticipated to be occupied each calendar year. 
(4)  The school district shall review the application in accordance with the provisions of article V, section F of the school concurrency agreement within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the application. 
(5)  Once the school district has reviewed the application, it shall issue a letter of determination of concurrency if the impacts of the proposed development's student growth do not cause the adopted LOS to be exceeded. If the development is not in compliance, the letter of determination of concurrency shall detail why the development is not in compliance and shall offer the applicant the opportunity to enter into a ninety-day negotiation period. During the ninety-day negotiation period, the applicant shall meet with the school district in an effort to mitigate the impact from the development. Mitigation shall be limited to those options which the school district recognizes and assumes the responsibility to operate and which will maintain the adopted LOS standards for the first five (5) years from receipt of the school district's letter of determination of concurrency; however, the village shall have the opportunity to review the mitigation options. If the school district and the developer agree to mitigation, the letter of determination of concurrency shall be issued, conditional approval upon the agreed mitigation measures, and an agreement between the school district and the developer. If mitigation is not agreed to, the letter of determination of concurrency shall be detailed why mitigation proposals were rejected and detail why the proposed new residential development is not in compliance. In this case, no development order shall be issued. 
(6)  Letter of determination of school concurrency finding the development in compliance shall be valid for one (1) year from the date of issuance unless extended by the school district. Once the village's site-specific development order is issued, the concurrency determination shall run with the development order. 
(c)  Development order approval. 
(1)  No development order for a proposed new residential development shall be approved unless there is a valid letter of determination of concurrency from the school district finding the development in compliance. 
(2)  If the letter of determination of concurrency requires conditions or mitigation to be placed on the development, the development order issued by the village shall incorporate those conditions. 
(3)  If the letter of determination of concurrency requires the development to be phased to mitigation, the conditions of approval of the development order shall implement the phasing requirements by specifying that building permit applications will not be accepted if the conditions are not fulfilled. 
(4)  In no case shall a development order be issued unless provisions are made through conditions of approval or by agreement between the developer and school district to provide performance security when required. 
(d)  Appeals. Applicants seeking relief from school district decisions shall appeal such decisions as provided for by law. 
(Ord. No. 220, § 106, 5-20-86; Ord. No. 639, § 2, 6-20-02; Ord. No. 771, § 1, 11-16-06; Ord. No. 940, § 1, 1-19-17) 
Sec. 26-7. - Proportionate fair-share program. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
(b)  Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments that fail to meet the standards of this chapter and the village's comprehensive plan on a roadway within the village that is not the responsibility of Palm Beach County, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) or another agency. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to the following: 
(1)  Collector and arterial roads which are not the responsibility of the village pursuant to section 1.3(4) of the Charter of Palm Beach County, Florida. However, a traffic concurrency letter from the county is required to be submitted by the applicant certifying compliance with the county-wide traffic performance standards ordinance adopted pursuant to the County Charter prior to the issuance of a development order by the village. 
(2)  Developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. 163.3180(12). 
(3)  Projects exempted from this chapter by state law. 
(4)  Projects that received traffic concurrency approval prior to December 1, 2006. 
(5)  Individual single-family homes. 
(6)  Vested projects. 
(c)  General requirements. An applicant may choose to satisfy the LOS for transportation by making, a proportionate fair-share contribution, so long as each of the following requirements is met: 
(1)  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
(2)  The road improvement necessary to maintain the LOS for transportation is identified in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation shall meet the village's design standards for locally maintained roadways. 
(d)  Intergovernmental coordination. Pursuant to policies in the intergovernmental coordination element of the comprehensive plan, the village shall coordinate with Palm Beach County and other affected jurisdictions such as FDOT regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(e)  Application process. 
(1)  In the event of a lack of capacity to maintain the LOS for transportation, the applicant shall have the opportunity to satisfy LOS for transportation requirements through the proportionate fair-share program subject to the requirements of subsection (c). 
(2)  Prior to the submittal of an application, eligible applicants shall schedule a preapplication meeting with village staff. Subsequent to the preapplication meeting, eligible applicants shall submit a completed development application and all documentation requested by the village. The applicant shall be required to pay a reasonable fee for the cost of reviewing the application, said fee to be set by resolution of the village council. If the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system (SIS), then FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the preapplication meeting. The village shall also have the option of notifying and inviting Palm Beach County. 
(3)  Village staff shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete within fourteen (14) working days. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program as indicated in subsection (c), then the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed withdrawn and all fees forfeited to the village, unless the village determines that the applicant is working toward a remedy of the stated deficiencies in good faith, in which case the village may extend the deadline as deemed appropriate by the village. 
(4)  Pursuant to F.S. 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrency of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(5)  When an application is deemed sufficient and complete in accordance with subparagraph (3) above, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement prepared by the village shall be executed by the applicant and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility, no later than sixty (60) days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient and complete application. If the agreement is not received by the village within these sixty (60) days, then the application will be deemed withdrawn and all fees forfeited to the village, unless the village determines that the applicant is working toward a remedy of the stated deficiencies in good faith, in which case the village may extend the deadline as deemed appropriate by the village. 
(6)  No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the village through an administrative approval. 
(f)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for transportation LOS impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development eligible for participation under the proportionate fair-share program shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate a development's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. 163.3180(12) as follows: 
The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS. 
OR, as such is expressed by the following mathematical formula: 
Proportionate Fair-Share = s[[(Development Trips)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × Cost;sub \sub;] Where: Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the village's concurrency management system; SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i" per subsection (c); Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering review, inspection, administration, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost, including contingencies, in the year it will be incurred.  
(4)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the village engineer shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual and/or anticipated cost of the improvement in the year that construction will occur. 
(5)  If an improvement is proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be based on an engineer's certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and approved by the village engineer or by some other method approved by the village engineer. 
(g)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against road impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by road impact fees which have been established or amended by the village as set forth in chapter 10, at article V, Impact fees. 
(2)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed project. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed project cannot be transferred to any other project. 
(h)  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement ("agreement"), the applicant shall receive a certification of concurrency reservation for capital road facilities. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within twelve (12) months, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply, unless the village and the applicant mutually agree to an extension. 
(2)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full no later than issuance of the first building permit, and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted more than ninety (90) days from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment, pursuant to subsection (f) and adjusted according1y. 
(3)  In the event an agreement requires the applicant to pay or build one hundred (100) percent of one (1) or more road improvements, all such improvements shall be commenced prior to issuance of a building permit and assured by a binding agreement that is accompanied by a performance security, as determined by the village, which is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. 
(4)  Dedication of necessary rights-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement shall be completed prior to issuance of the first building permit. 
(5)  Any requested change to a development subsequent to the issuance of a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the chance would generate additional traffic that would require additional mitigation. 
(6)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs paid to the village will be nonrefundable. 
(i)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. Proportionate fair-share revenues may be used as the fifty (50) percent local match for funding under the FDOT TRIP, or any other matching requirement for state and federal grant programs as may be allowed by law. 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the village that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of subsection (c).

The village shall make an effort to provide this same notice to the owner(s) of the real property if different than the applicant.

vii.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the village council shall issue a written order that includes findings of fact based on evidence of record and conclusions of law. As part of its order, the village council may modify all or a portion of the special exception approval, revoke all or a portion of the special exception approval, impose additional conditions on the special exception approval, or leave the special exception approval as-is.

Sec. 26-61. - Planned commercial developments. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this provision is to encourage the development of a more complete and flexible commercial environment through the application of enlightened and imaginative approaches to shopping center design. This section will allow for a variety of architectural solutions, preservation of natural features, reduction of land consumption by roads, separate vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems, establishment of a neighborhood identity and focus, and will ideally provide for the compatible coexistence of man with his environment. 
(b)  Location. All planned commercial developments must contain frontage of a minimum of three hundred (300) feet along a major arterial or collector road as determined by the village engineer. 
(c)  Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area for the applicable zoning district shall apply.

(4)  Previously approved planned commercial developments may seek modification of the original development order to subdivide the project consistent with this section. 
(j)  Planned commercial/residential development. Planned developments, consisting of both commercial and residential components, may be approved by the village council as a special exception use, so long as the commercial portion of the planned commercial/residential development has been zoned appropriately and meets the requirements for the special exception use as a PCD as set forth at section 26-61. hereinabove; and the residential portion of such multiple use development is zoned appropriately to allow a PUD special exception and meets the requirements for the special exception of a PUD as set forth at section 26-74, PUD-Planned unit development in all respects except that only one (1) dwelling unit type is required unless a mix is required by the zoning district in which the planned development is located. The installation of a buffer to be placed between residential and commercial property as required by subsection 26-61(f) is expressly waived for an approved planned commercial/residential development, so long as the planned development provides for adequate pedestrian circulation and architectural solutions designed to accommodate both residential and commercial uses in close proximity to each other.

The village council may grant two (2) time extensions of the variance for a period not to exceed a total of twelve (12) months upon the submittal of a request for extension by the applicant on forms prescribed by the village prior to the expiration of the initial one-year period. When application for extension of a site plan which includes a required variance is requested, the approval or denial of the site plan extension shall include the approval or denial of the time extension for the associated variance. 
(2)  Should a variance lapse and provided that there is no change whatsoever in the requested variance, the variance may be approved upon a rehearing presented to the village after application to the director or designee for another approval for such rehearing within six (6) months from the expiration date of the initial variance approval. The village council may consider the variance rehearing request at a public hearing and the applicant shall pay all fees and charges associated with the rehearing of the variance request as set forth in the resolution of the village council. The maximum time of the variance approved on rehearing shall coincide with the maximum time permitted for the site plan in which the variance is utilized, if any; otherwise, the maximum time shall not exceed twelve (12) months. This procedure for rehearing of identical variances which have lapsed specifically supersedes any variance procedure set forth elsewhere in the Village Code. 
(e)  Architectural approvals by the planning and zoning commission; duty to commence development in timely manner; extensions . Architectural approvals granted by the planning and zoning commission pursuant to their final approval authority under chapter 2 at division 6 of this Code of Ordinances shall automatically lapse if not utilized within one (1) year from the date such architectural approval was granted by the planning and zoning commission.

The purpose of this section is to provide additional design standards and guidelines for commercial and industrial projects twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in size or larger to supplement existing development standards with specific additional regulations that apply to the design of these very large twenty thousand (20,000) square feet (or larger) buildings and also to groupings of structures which, in combined total, meet the twenty thousand (20,000) square-foot threshold required for applicability of this section to such projects. The design of commercial and industrial building(s) and projects determines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscape and character of a community. Massive and/or generic developments that do not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be detrimental to a community's image and sense of place. The goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and strong community image and identity by providing for architectural and site design treatments which will enhance the visual appearance of commercial and industrial development in the Village of Royal Palm Beach, while still providing for design flexibility in accordance with the goals, policies and objectives of the Village of Royal Palm Beach Comprehensive Plan and the purpose and intent of this Code. These regulations are also intended to promote the use of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (C.P.T.E.D.) principles including: 
Visibility -Visibility for law enforcement and other people in the area; 
Natural surveillance -Placing areas of activity where they can be seen by law enforcement and the public; and 
Defensible space -Designing areas which people will take as their own and not be willing to relinquish this space to other undesirable activities.

(4)  Acceptance and maintenance of required improvements. 
a.  The dedication of land to the village under this section shall not constitute an acceptance of the dedication by the village. The acceptance of the dedication shall be by a resolution of the village council adopted at such time as all improvements meet or exceed the standards set forth in section 22-50 of Village Code. The village engineer, upon satisfactory completion of required improvements, shall certify to the village council that the developer has complied with the provisions of section 22-50 and shall recommend to the village council the acceptance of the dedications and when applicable, the maintenance of the required improvements.

The surety required herein shall be released or terminated only upon the adoption by village council of a resolution, as recommended by the village engineer, authorizing such release or termination. 
(f)  General standard . It is hereby found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety requires that ten (10) acres of property for every one thousand (1,000) persons be devoted for local park and recreational purposes. 
(g)  Formula for dedication of land . To determine park and recreational land for residential developments to be dedicated in accordance with the general standard of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons, the following formula shall be used: 
(1)  For single family developments, the average number of persons per dwelling unit equals three (3); multiply this by the number of dwelling units proposed to arrive at the projected number of persons for the project; divide this number by one thousand (1,000); multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons. 
(2)  For multi-family and mobile home facility developments, the average number of persons per dwelling unit equal two and one-half (2.5); multiply this by the number of dwelling units proposed to arrive at the projected number of persons for the project; divide this number by one thousand (1,000); multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons. 
(3)  For senior housing facility, congregate care facility, assisted living facility, and nursing home facility developments, the number of persons shall be determined by the maximum number of occupants based on the approved site plan for the facility; divide this number by one thousand (1,000); multiply the resulting number by the park standard of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) persons. 
(h)  Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication . 
(1)  General formula . If it is determined by the village council or planning and zoning director, as applicable, that no park or recreation facility is to be located in whole or part within the proposed residential development to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, then the residential developer shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of the land acreage determined by the formula in section 26-75.4(g) above, and in an amount determined in accordance with section 26-75.4(h)(3) below, such fee to be used by the village for acquisition or development of park and recreational land which will serve the residents of the area being developed. 
(2)  Determination of land or fee . The village council or the planning and zoning director, as applicable, shall determine whether to accept land dedication or elect to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof by consideration of the following: 
a.  Topography, geology, access and location of land in the development available for dedication; 
b.  Size and shape of the development and land available for dedication; 
c.  The feasibility of dedication; 
d.  Availability of previously acquired park property; 
e.  Conformity with the recreation and open space element of the comprehensive plan; 
f.  If fifty (50) percent of the land required to be dedicated to the village is provided as private open space/facilities for park and recreational purposes within a proposed residential development so that a credit would be given in accordance with section 26-75.4(h)(5) below, and the remaining fifty (50) percent of land required to be dedicated to the village is less than three (3) acres in size, then the residential developer shall be required to pay a fee in lieu of land dedication for the land that is less than three (3) acres in size; and 
g.  If fifty (50) percent of the land required to be dedicated to the village is provided as private open space/facilities for park and recreational purposes within a proposed residential development so that a credit would be given in accordance with section 26-75.4(h)(5) below, and the remaining fifty (50) percent of land required to be dedicated to the village is ten (10) acres or more in size, then the residential developer shall be required to dedicate the land that is ten (10) acres or more in size to the village. No fees in lieu of dedication shall be accepted. 
(3)  Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication . Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication either in whole or in part, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated pursuant to the formula prescribed above. The fee shall be paid pursuant to the provisions contained in this section. Fair market value of the land shall be determined by: 
a.  An appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser approved by the village. Such appraisal shall be obtained at the residential developer's own expense and such appraisal shall value the land based on the highest and best use in the applicable zoning district; or 
b.  The contract purchase price of the land so long as proof of purchase price is provided to the village in a form acceptable to the village, and the sale/purchase of the property did not occur more than two (2) years prior to the determination by the village council or the planning and zoning director, as applicable, of the amount of the fee to be paid in lieu of land dedication. 
(4)  Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee. The residential developer shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the following formula: 
a.  When only a portion of the land calculated by the formula for park and recreational use is to be dedicated, such portion shall be dedicated for local park or recreational purposes, and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions set out above shall be paid for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to the above provisions. 
b.  When sufficient park and recreational land in the vicinity has already been acquired by the village and only a small portion of land is needed from the residential development to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated, and a fee computed pursuant to the formula provided above shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated, such fees to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreational facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreational facilities in the area serving the development. 
(5)  Credit for private open space and facilities . Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed residential development, partial credit, not to exceed fifty (50) percent, may be given against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the village council or planning and zoning director, as applicable, finds it is in the public interest to do so, and further finds that all of the following standards are met: 
a.  The yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space for purposes of determined credits under this section; and 
b.  For residential developments where units are owned in fee simple (e.g., single-family, townhome, condominium units), the private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon shall be restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant which shall run with the land in favor of the existing or future residents, and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the village. Further, the private open space and recreation facilities placed thereon shall be privately owned and maintained by the existing or future residents of the development as common property. Private ownership and maintenance by the existing or future residents shall be adequately provided for by a recorded written homeowners association or property owners association declaration of covenants and restrictions, or other unity of control document that is acceptable to and approved by the village attorney prior to issuance of a development order or building permits to construct the residential units. The residential developer, and its successors and assigns, shall not be permitted to sell, transfer or convey the private open space for which credit is given or the recreational facilities placed thereon to a third party that is not the homeowners association or property owners association owned and controlled by the existing or future residents of the development. The residential developer, and its successors and assigns, shall transfer ownership of the private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon to the homeowners association or property owners association at the time of developer turnover or at some earlier date agreed to by the village. The private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon shall not be made open and available for the general public (e.g., public clubhouse, public pool); and 
c.  For residential developments under single ownership (e.g., apartment complex), the private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon shall be restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant or condition of approval which shall run with the land in favor of the existing or future residents, and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the village. Further, the private open space and recreation facilities placed thereon shall be privately owned and maintained by the single owner for the benefit of the existing or future residents of the development. The private open space for which credit is given and all recreation facilities placed thereon shall not be made open and available for the general public (e.g., public clubhouse, public pool); and 
d.  The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and locations; and 
e.  Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreation and open space element of the comprehensive plan; and 
f.  The open space for which credit is given provides a minimum of five (5) of the local park basic requirements listed below or a combination of such and other recreational improvements that will meet the specific recreation park needs of the future residents of the area.

(e)  Private developments. 
(1)  Art in public places requirement. Private developments shall be required to include an amount for art in public places, which shall be an amount for the purchase of permanent artwork equal to one (1) percent of the total vertical construction costs of all buildings on a project site (the "public art requirement"). The total vertical construction costs used to determine the public art requirement shall be based on certified costs estimates provided by the developer to the village. Total vertical construction costs for a project shall not be artificially divided to circumvent the public art requirement. The public art requirement for renovation of an existing building shall be calculated based on the total vertical construction costs of the renovation only and shall exclude the assessed value of the existing building. The village shall not give credit toward the public art requirement for donated artwork or temporary installations. Artwork shall be located in public places, and may be integral parts of the building, situated within or outside of the building, may be located in or near facilities which already have been constructed, or may be located in other public places where numbers of people may experience them. The public art requirement shall not apply in the following circumstances: 
a.  The public art requirement is calculated to be less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) for the entire development; 
b.  The public art requirement shall apply only to the first twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) for any single project, which has a total vertical construction cost exceeding twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00); 
c.  The full or partial reconstruction of a structure which has been damaged by fire, flood, wind or other act of God; or 
d.  The full or partial renovation of a structure in order to install fire sprinklers or improvements required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
(2)  Procedures. 
a.  Development approvals required. The location(s) of all artwork constituting the public art requirement for a project shall receive site plan approval by the village council, upon recommendation from the public art advisory board, prior to installation. Additionally, the design and features of all artwork constituting the public art requirement for a project shall receive architectural and aesthetic approval by the village council, upon recommendation from the public art advisory board, prior to installation. Architectural and aesthetic approval may run concurrently with site plan approval. 
b.  Shopping centers and planned developments. All buildings within a shopping center, or the commercial and/or industrial components of a planned development shall be assessed cumulatively towards the art in public places requirements, even if they are permitted separately or phased separately. 
c.  Phased developments. A phased development refers to a project which is being developed in phases, which phases are part of but collectively make up the whole development shown on the master plan or site plan. 
1.  Phased development that is not part of a shopping center or planned development. The public art requirement shall be imposed at the time of site plan approval for the entire development, and may be amended as necessary through subsequent site plan modification approvals. The location of artwork constituting the public art requirement shall be identified on the site plan as part of a particular phase. Unless an alternative deadline is established in a development order, or a time extension is granted by the village council, no certificate of occupancy for the phase in which the artwork constituting the public art requirement is located shall be issued until the artwork is installed in accordance with applicable development orders and permits. 
2.  Phased development that is part of a shopping center or planned development. All shopping centers and planned developments shall be required to have master plan approval by the village council, upon recommendation from the public art advisory board. The master developer shall be required to identify the location(s) for artwork that will satisfy the public art requirement for the shopping center or planned development on the master plan. Such location(s) shall be common property owned by a commercial owners association or property owners association. The public art requirement shall be imposed on each parcel within the development at the time of site plan approval for that parcel, even if the individual parcel's public art requirement is calculated to be less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), unless the two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) public art cap for the entire shopping center or planned development already has been satisfied through previous development approvals. The location(s) of artwork as shown on the master plan, and any public art requirement imposed pursuant to site plan approval may be amended as necessary through subsequent approvals. Prior to building permit issuance for a particular parcel within the shopping center or planned development, the parcel owner or developer of said parcel shall provide a bond, letter of credit or cash payment to the commercial owners association or property owners association for the shopping center or planned development in an amount equal to that parcel's allotted public art requirement. If a bond or letter of credit is used, that bond or letter of credit shall be payable to the association. The bond, letter of credit or cash payment shall be held by the association in escrow until such time as the last undeveloped parcel in the shopping center or planned development receives its building permit from the village, or the escrow account reaches the two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) public art cap, whichever occurs earlier. At such time the last undeveloped parcel receives its building permit, or the escrow account reaches the two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) public art cap, whichever occurs earlier, the association shall pursue all development approvals and permits required to install the artwork at the predetermined location(s) on the master plan, and install the artwork. Once the association is required to install artwork pursuant to this section, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any structure in the shopping center or planned development until such artwork is installed in accordance with applicable development orders and permits, unless an alternative deadline is established in a development order or a time extension is granted by the village council. 
d.  Non-phased developments. A non-phased development refers to a project which is being developed in a single phase as depicted on the site plan. For non-phased developments, the public art requirement shall be imposed at the time of site plan approval for the entire development, and may be amended as necessary through subsequent site plan modification approvals. The location of artwork constituting the public art requirement shall be identified on the site plan. Unless an alternative deadline is established in a development order, or a time extension is granted by the village council, no certificate of occupancy for the project shall be issued until the artwork is installed in accordance with applicable development orders and permits. 
e.  Renovations. 
1.  Exterior renovations. The public art requirement for exterior renovations, with or without accompanying interior renovations, shall be imposed at the time of site plan modification and/or architectural approval for the renovation as applicable. Unless an alternative deadline is established in a development order, or a time extension is granted by the village council, no certificate of occupancy for the project shall be issued until the artwork is installed in accordance with applicable development orders and permits. 
2.  Interior renovations only. The public art requirement for interior renovations, which do not accompany exterior renovations, shall be imposed by the building official at the time of building permit issuance. The building official shall require that certified cost estimates for the interior renovation be provided to the village prior to the issuance of a building permit in order to calculate and impose the public art requirement for the project. The location of any public artwork required to be provided, and the design and features of such artwork shall receive site plan and architectural and aesthetic approvals in accordance with this section prior to installation. Unless an alternative deadline is established in a development order, or a time extension is granted by the village council, no certificate of occupancy for the project shall be issued until the artwork is installed in accordance with applicable development orders and permits.
