The above mentioned right of subrogation in favor of the village, as employer, shall be in

This policy shall be administered as provided for in those sections of the personnel manual
pertaining to rights of subrogation. (Ord. 97-40, 10-13-1997)
1-8-16: POLICY ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts have determined
sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment free from
sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals
of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the Village of Morton Grove to prohibit
harassment of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee, or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal
agents, municipal employees, and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually
harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
A. Definition of Sexual Harassment: This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment
as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment
as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a
sexual nature when:
1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or
condition of an individual’s employment, or
2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for
employment decisions affecting such individual, or
3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an
individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
working environment.
Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
1. Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about
sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated
requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even outside of their
presence, of a sexual nature.
2. Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures,
sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing” noises.
3. Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic
material or websites.
4. Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body,
any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
5. Textual/Electronic: “sexting” (electronically sending messages with sexual content,
including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment,
cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication (e-mail,
text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and
social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the
other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to
some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The courts will assess sexual
harassment by a standard of what would offend a “reasonable person.”
B. Procedure for Reporting an Allegation of Sexual Harassment: An employee who either
observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself to be the object of sexual
harassment should deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly
communicating her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate
supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person
making the report. Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
1. Electronic/Direct Communication. If there is sexual harassing behavior in the
workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express her/his
objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request the offending behavior stop.
The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they
should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
2. Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct communication is
undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the
situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of
the person making the report, a department head, a director of human resources,
an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of
the municipality.
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not
assume the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim
fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be
presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
3. Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt,
thorough and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so
problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all
municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human
Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for
information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR
complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a
continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said or done,
the date, the time, and the place), including, but not limited to, written records such as
letters, notes, memos, and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated regardless
of how the matter comes to the attention of the Village. However, because of the serious
implications of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their
investigation and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is
a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
C. Prohibition on Retaliation for Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations: No municipal
official, municipal agency, municipal employee, or municipal agency or office shall take
any retaliatory action against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
1. Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy, or
2. The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of this policy, or
3. Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this policy.
For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or
conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation for a
municipal employee’s involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in good faith
is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower protection from
retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of
promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the
following:
1. Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity,
policy, or practice of any officer, member, agency, or other Village employee, the
Village employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation, or
2. Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an
investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by
any officer, member, agency, or other employee, or
3. Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State
Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act [740 ILCS 174/15(a)], an employer may not retaliate
against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or
before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe the information discloses a violation of a state
or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an
employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where
the employee has reasonable cause to believe the information discloses a violation of a
state or federal law, rule, or regulation. [740 ILCS 174/15(b)].
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation
for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because
he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual
harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint,
testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a
promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge – due
within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation.
D. Consequences of a Violation of the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment: In addition to
any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to municipal policies,
employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or a collective
bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the Prohibition on Sexual
Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines
and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality
shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and
any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law, or a state or federal agency.
E. Consequences for Knowingly Making a False Report: A false report is a report of sexual
harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish
some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual
harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven.
Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report
is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy
shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal policies,
employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks, and/or collective
bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any
provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an Ethics Commission, an
Inspector General, the State Police, a State’s Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other
law enforcement official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may
levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes a
false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

resales.
C. Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege of originating or
receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made tax-free on the ground of
being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the

resale.

fines and set a new date for a new hearing on the merits. The Defendant shall
receive notice of the date, time and place of the new hearing via first-class mail,
postage prepaid, to the address set forth on the petition. Unless the Defendant
establishes the Village did not provide proper notice of the original hearing, the
Defendant shall be assessed an administrative fee set forth in Section 3-3A-6-G of
this Code.

restraint in such a manner as to prevent its operation. Should a vehicle eligible for
immobilization be parked or left in violation of any provision of this title concerning
obstruction of traffic, ingress or egress from driveways, alleys, fire lanes, hydrants,
stations, handicapped parking spaces, or in any place where it constitutes an
obstruction or hazard, or where it impedes village employees during such
operations as snow removal, the chief of police is authorized to declare said vehicle
an "unlawful vehicle" as defined in section 5-7-1 of this title and said vehicle may
be towed immediately pursuant to chapter 7 of this title.
2. Any and all vehicles of an owner who has on at least five (5) occasions been found
to have violated any provision of this title or any section of this code or any
ordinance of the village of Morton Grove by said owner and who has not paid the
fines, fees and/or penalties assessed for five (5) or more said violations within
twenty eight (28) days after being assessed is hereby declared an unlawful vehicle
and may be towed pursuant to section 5-7-5 of this title and/or may be eligible for

a. At least twenty one (21) days prior to immobilization, a notice of impending
vehicle immobilization and towing has been sent to the owner by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at the address of the owner, as recorded with the
secretary of state, or in the case of a vehicle bearing a registration number of a
state other than Illinois, at the address of the registered owner recorded in that

of the owner, the state registration number of the vehicle, a description of the
sections of this code and/or ordinances violated and the citation numbers and
issue dates of the unpaid violations, and the fines, fees and penalties still due

subject to immobilization and/or towing unless the unpaid fines, fees, and
penalties set forth in this notice are paid within fourteen (14) days. The notice
shall also advise a person may challenge the validity of the impending vehicle
immobilization and/or towing within fourteen (14) days after said notice was
mailed by appearing in person before the chief of police or his designee and
submitting evidence which in the opinion of the chief of police or his designee
conclusively proves the impending immobilization and/or towing is not valid
because:
(1) The owner of the vehicle to be immobilized was not the owner of record
when the violations listed in the notice were issued; or
(2) The owner had not accumulated five (5) or more violations cited in the
notice for which the fines, fees and penalties remain unpaid for more than
twenty eight (28) days after being assessed.
b. If the chief of police or his designee receives evidence challenging the validity
of the immobilization and/or towing, he/she shall review all evidence received
and within five (5) business days of said receipt shall determine whether the
immobilization and/or towing is valid. If he/she determines immobilization
and/or towing is not valid, he/she shall rescind the notice and inform the owner
in writing of such rescission. The formal rules of evidence will not apply and
hearsay evidence may be considered if it is the type commonly relied upon by
reasonably prudent persons. If the chief of police or his designee determines
immobilization is valid, he/she shall so inform the owner in writing, and the
immobilization and/or towing shall proceed.
3. Upon immobilization of a vehicle, a notice shall be affixed to the vehicle in a
conspicuous place. Such notice shall warn the vehicle is immobilized and any
attempt to remove the device, or move or tow the vehicle may result in damage to
the vehicle and/or the device. The unauthorized removal of, or damage to the
immobilization device is a violation of 720 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/16-1 (theft)
or 5/21-1 (criminal damage to property) as well as this code and is subject to a
penalty in accordance with title 1, chapter 4 of this code. The notice shall also
provide information specifying how release of the immobilization device may be
had, and how the owner may obtain a postimmobilization hearing pursuant to this
subsection.

described in subsection D2a of this section, and any other fines incurred

placement and/or removal of the immobilization device and any towing and
storage fees; or

equal to the total amount owed as set forth in the notice described in

mailed, the vehicle immobilization administrative fee as set forth in title 1,
chapter 4 of this code, any fee due to the company responsible for the

storage fees.

shall be held by the village's adjudication hearing officer at the next regularly
scheduled hearing date at least five (5) business days after the request was
properly made, or a special hearing set at the discretion of the hearing officer.
Failure to request a hearing or attend a scheduled hearing shall be deemed a
waiver of the right to such hearing. In event of such failure, any amount deposited
pursuant to subsection D4 of this section shall be forfeited.
b. The sole purpose of the hearing shall be to determine whether the
immobilization was valid. A hearing provided by this section shall not determine
the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or notice of violation issued
relative to the immobilized vehicle.
c. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine whether
the immobilization was valid. If he/she determines the immobilization was not
valid, the vehicle shall be immediately released and all fees or bond previously
paid pursuant to subsection D4 of this section shall be refunded. If he/she
determines the immobilization was valid, he/she shall so notify the owner via
U.S. first class mail, and the immobilization device may only be released upon
payment of the total amount owed as set forth in the notice described in
subsection D2a of this section, the administrative fee as set forth in title 1,
chapter 4 of this code, the immobilization fee due to the company responsible
for the placement and/or removal of the immobilization device, the payment of

number of the vehicle, the name and address of the person operating the vehicle
at the time it was impounded, the reason the vehicle was impounded and towed,
and the date and time the vehicle was towed. The notice shall also provide
information specifying how the owner may obtain the release of the vehicle, and
shall advise that a person may challenge the validity of the impoundment and
towing within two (2) business days after said notice was mailed by appearing in
person before the chief of police and submitting evidence which in the opinion of
the chief of police conclusively proves the impoundment and towing was not valid.
4. Within two (2) business days after receipt of evidence challenging the validity of
the impoundment and towing pursuant to subsection E3 of this section, the chief of
police shall review all such evidence. If the chief of police determines the
impoundment and towing was valid, he/she shall order the continued
impoundment of the vehicle. If the chief of police determines impoundment and
towing was not valid, the vehicle will be released without penalty or other fees, and
any bond, penalty or fee previously paid pursuant to this subsection E shall be
refunded.
5. The owner shall also be entitled to a posttow hearing pursuant to section 5-7-7 of
this title. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of
evidence the vehicle was used in connection with a violation set forth in subsection
E1 of this section, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of
record of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative penalty in
accordance with title 1, chapter 4 of this code and requiring the vehicle to continue
to be impounded until the owner pays the administrative penalty to the village plus
fees to the tower for the towing and storage of the vehicle. If the owner fails to
appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the
village. If the hearing officer finds the vehicle was not used in connection with a
violation set forth in subsection E1 of this section, the hearing officer shall order
the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond without fees.
6. If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this subsection, such penalty
shall constitute a debt due and owing to the village. If a cash bond has been posted
pursuant to this section, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle has
been impounded when such a penalty is imposed, the village may seek to obtain a
judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided
by law.
7. If an owner fails to request or appear at the posttow hearing, or the hearing is
resolved in the village's favor and the owner fails to pay the administrative penalty
and applicable fees, the vehicle may be disposed of in the manner provided by
section 5-7-8 of this title.
8. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lienholder, or other
person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under
this section until the administrative penalty and fees applicable under this section
have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an
impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the
vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the
village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts
required to pay all lienholders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty,
plus the applicable fees.
9. This section shall not replace or otherwise abrogate any existing state or federal
laws or village ordinance pertaining to vehicle seizure and impoundment, and
these penalties shall be in addition to any penalties assessed by a court for any
criminal charges.
10. This section shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at that
time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within seventy
two (72) hours after the theft was discovered. (Ord. 11-17, 6-13-2011)

No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any street any unauthorized sign,
signal, marking or device which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official
traffic control device or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic. (1969 Code §
71.050)
5-2-5: TRAFFIC SIGNALS, SPEED CONTROL:
The village engineer is authorized to regulate the timing of traffic signals so as to permit the
movement of traffic in an orderly and safe manner at speeds slightly at a variance from the
speeds otherwise applicable within the district or at intersections. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
5-2-6: TRAFFIC SIGNALS, LEGEND:
A. Colors And Symbols: Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting
the words "go", "caution", or "stop" or exhibiting different colored lights successively,
the following colors only shall be used and said terms and lights shall indicate as
follows:
1. Circular Green Alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight or
turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But
vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.
Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked
or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed otherwise by a pedestrian signal.
2. Steady Yellow: Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter or the related green movement
is being terminated when vehicular traffic may not enter the intersection.
Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian
control signal as provided in this code, are thereby advised that there is insufficient
time to cross the roadway, and no pedestrian will start to cross.
3. Steady Red Alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point as may be indicated by
a clearly visible line; if there is no such line, then vehicles shall stop before
entering such crosswalk and shall remain standing until the green indication is
shown, unless otherwise directed by a sign or arrow.
No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he can do so safely
and without interfering with any vehicular traffic or unless a separate "Walk"
indication is shown.
4. Green Straight Through Arrow (Alone): Vehicular traffic facing such signal may
proceed straight through, but shall not turn right or left. Such vehicular traffic shall
yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.
Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within the
appropriately marked or unmarked crosswalk unless directed otherwise by a
pedestrian signal.
5. Green Turn Arrow (Alone Or With Circular Green, With Steady Yellow, With Steady
Red, Or With Green Straight Through Arrow): Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall
comply with the meaning of the circular green, steady yellow or straight through
arrow indication as if it were shown alone, except that such vehicular traffic may
cautiously enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the green
turn arrow. Vehicular traffic shall yield right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
In the event that an official traffic control signal or flashing red signal is erected
and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section
shall be applicable, except as to provisions which by their nature can have no
application. Any stop required shall be at a sign or marking on the pavement
indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or
marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
6. Green Arrow Alone: Vehicular traffic facing the signal may enter the intersection
only to make the movement or movements indicated by the arrows, but shall not
interfere with other traffic or endanger pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk.
In the event an official traffic control signal or flashing red signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall
be applicable, except as to provisions which by their nature can have no
application. Any stop required shall be at a sign or marking on the pavement
indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such signs or
marking, the stop shall be made at the signal. (1969 Code § 71.035)
B. Flashing Signals: Whenever flashing red or yellow signals are used, they shall require
obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
1. Flashing Red (Stop Signal): When a red lens is illuminated by rapid intermittent
flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an
intersection or at a limit line when marked, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after
making a stop at a stop sign.
2. Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal): When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or
past such signal only with caution. (1969 Code § 71.040)
C. Pedestrian Control: Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
"Walk" or "Don't Walk" are in place, such signals shall indicate as follows:
1. "Walk": Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in the
direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the driver of all
vehicles.
2. "Don't Walk": While the "Don't Walk" signal is illuminated, either steady or flashing,
no pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of the signal, but any
pedestrian who has partly completed his crossing during the "Walk" indication shall
proceed to a sidewalk or safety island, if one is provided. (1969 Code § 71.045)
5-2-7: CROSSWALKS AND SAFETY ZONES:
The village engineer is hereby authorized:
A. To designate and maintain, by appropriate devices, marks, or lines upon the surface of
the roadway, crosswalks at intersections where in his opinion there is a particular
danger to pedestrians crossing the roadway, and at such other places as he may deem
necessary.
B. To establish safety zones of such kind and character and at such places as he may
deem necessary for the protection of pedestrians. (1969 Code § 71.065)

The village engineer is hereby authorized and required to establish bus stops, bus stands and
stands for other passenger common carrier motor vehicles on such public streets in such
places and in such number as he shall determine to be of the greatest benefit and
convenience to the public, and every such bus stop, bus stand, taxicab stand, or other stand
shall be designated by appropriate signs. (1969 Code § 71.075)
5-2-10: LANES, DIRECTION DESIGNATION:
The village engineer is hereby authorized to determine and designate streets, parts of streets,
or specific lanes thereon upon which vehicular traffic shall proceed in one direction during one
period and the opposite direction during another period of the day and shall place and
maintain appropriate markings, signs, barriers or other devices to give notice thereof. The
village engineer may erect signs temporarily designating lanes to be used by traffic moving in
a particular direction, regardless of the centerline of the roadway. (1969 Code § 71.080)
5-2-11: TURN MARKERS:
The village engineer is authorized to place markers, buttons, or signs within or adjacent to
intersections directing the course to be traveled by vehicles turning at such intersections.

studies show that some variations should be made in the interest of public safety, may vary
from that ordinarily prescribed by law or ordinance. (1969 Code § 71.080)

Where such test is made, the following provisions shall apply:
a. Chemical analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance
to be considered valid under the provisions of this section shall be performed
according to regulations and standards promulgated by the Illinois department
of public health in consultation with the Illinois department of law enforcement
by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by that department for this
purpose.
b. When a person shall submit to blood test at the request of a law enforcement
officer under the provisions of subsection B of this section, only a physician
authorized to practice medicine, a registered nurse or other qualified person
approved by the Illinois department of public health may withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug content therein.
This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.
c. The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified technician, chemist,
registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law
enforcement officer. The failure in inability to obtain an additional test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests
taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.

the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or
tests shall be made available to the person or such person's attorney.

control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of
alcohol in the person's blood or breath at the time alleged as shown by analysis of
the person's blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance shall give rise to the
following presumptions:
a. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or less, it shall be
presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcohol.
b. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of 0.05 but less
than 0.10, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was
or was not under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be considered with
other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
influence of alcohol.
c. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, it shall be
presumed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
d. The foregoing provisions of this section shall not be construed as limiting the
introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the question whether
the person was under the influence of alcohol.
3. If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test under the provisions
of this section, evidence of refusal shall be submitted to the court for admission in
any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been
committed while the person under the influence of alcohol, or other drugs, or
combination of both was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.

may be reserved for persons with disabilities by the village administrator following
receipt of an application for the establishment of a reserved handicapped parking
space from an eligible applicant and determination by the village administrator
that such application meets the requirements of this section. Any resident licensed
driver of the village of Morton Grove, who has obtained "official designation", as
defined in this section, may apply for a parking space reserved for a disabled
person for themselves or any member of such person's household, if the
applicant's vehicle constitutes the primary mode of transportation for the person
with disabilities. The village administrator shall review the application to determine
the eligibility of the applicant for the special parking designation. No reserve
parking space shall be issued to any person if the household or any person therein
owns, rents, or has regular use of a private driveway, carport, or garage, that gives
access to the dwelling of the person with disabilities, or such other adequate off
street parking facilities are available.

spaces in each individual block. A block shall be designated by street addresses in
the one hundreds.
4. Annual Renewal: The reserved parking space shall be renewed each year by
application and by payment of an annual renewal fee as set forth in this section. If
a renewal is not requested, or if further investigation determines the applicant is
no longer eligible for a reserved parking space, or if the annual renewal fee is not
paid within thirty one (31) days after it becomes due, the signs designating the
reserved disabled parking spaces shall be removed.
5. Duty To Report Change: If the applicant no longer requires the reserved parking
space due to change in health status, death, change in address, or any other
reason, the applicant must notify the village administrator within thirty (30) days
following the change in status, and the village administrator shall cause the signs

7. Variance From The Provisions Of This Section: The village administrator may grant
a variance to the requirements of this section when such variance is necessary to
overcome an exceptional physical condition, practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardship which prevent a person with disabilities from accessing his/her residence
as intended by this section. The variance procedure is also intended to provide a
means of relief from the consequences of unforeseen restrictions in this section
which may result in unusual difficulties for an otherwise qualified applicant. If the
village administrator declines to grant such a variance, the applicant may apply for
a variance to the village's traffic safety commission. The traffic safety commission
shall publicly hear and rule on such request for variances within sixty (60) days
after receipt of the request. The traffic safety commission shall not grant the
variance unless it shall make findings of fact based on evidence presented in each
specific petition:
a. Not Self-Imposed: The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by
any persons presently having an interest in the subject property.
b. Nonprohibition Of Use Of Property: The circumstances or conditions are such
that the strict application of the provisions of this section would deprive the
applicant of a reasonable use of his/her property.
c. Not Detrimental To The Public Welfare: That the granting of the variance is in
harmony with the general purposes of this section and of other relevant
provisions of this code and will not be detrimental to the public welfare, public
safety or to other property in the community.
d. Not Detrimental To The Neighborhood: That the proposed variation will not
substantially increase congestion on the streets, resulting in reduced access to
the public streets, or cause significant inconvenience, or have a general
detrimental impact for other motorists, or substantially alter the character of
the neighborhood.

the requirements of 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-301, as amended from time to
time, or the requirements of a village of Morton Grove local ordinance with respect to
reserved parking for persons with disabilities. The erection of such a sign, or any sign

prohibitions pursuant to the terms of this chapter.

6-3-2: CURFEW:
A. Purpose: By the adoption of a curfew ordinance, the village of Morton Grove is
attempting to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other
persons, for the reduction of juvenile criminal activity, and for the protection of the
public. The village board has determined that because minors under the age of
seventeen (17) possess a particular vulnerability to crime and harmful influence under
certain circumstances or when not supervised or accompanied by a parent or legal
guardian at night, and because minors under the age of seventeen (17) often lack the
ability to make critical decisions in an informed and mature manner when exposed to
nighttime influences, a critical need exists for a minor curfew ordinance in the village
of Morton Grove. A curfew for those under the age of seventeen (17) will be in the
interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will assist in the
protection of minors as hereinabove described.

prohibit it from biting any person for a period of ten (10) days, if a licensed veterinarian
adjudges such confinement satisfactory. The veterinarian shall examine the animal on
the first, fifth, and tenth day from twenty four (24) hours of time of the bite. The

c. All meter vaults are to be kept clean and dry. All maintenance and repair of
meter vaults are the responsibility of the owner.
D. Meter Reading, Repairing Or Replacement:
1. An officer or employee designated by the superintendent of public works shall be
permitted at all reasonable hours to enter the premises or buildings of consumers
for the purpose of reading meters, testing, and examining meters, water pipes, and
fixtures, the manner in which water is used, or repairing or replacing meters. The
village shall have the right at any reasonable time to remove a meter temporarily
for the purpose of testing its accuracy. Any meter which fails to register within two
percent (2%) of the correct amount shall be repaired or replaced. Where such
officer or employee of the village shall be unable to gain access to the meter for
purpose of reading same, he may estimate the quantity of water consumed and,
for that purpose, may take into consideration the amount of water known to have
been consumed in a comparable previous period.
2. If any meter at any time fails to register the quantity of water passing through it,
the quantity shall be determined and the charge made based on the average
quantity registered during such preceding period of time prior to the date of failure
as the superintendent of the water department may direct.
3. No deductions will be made from water bills on account of leakage.
4. The water meter installed by the village or agent designated by the village on the
water pipes service line into the premises will be the official metering for all water.
This meter and only this meter will determine the usage of water during all billing
periods.

6. Residential meter repair or replacement shall be made by the village at village
expense. The water may be shut off to allow repairs to be made whenever notice is
given that repairs are contemplated.
7. Commercial and industrial meter repair or replacement shall be made by the
village or agent authorized to do so by the superintendent of public works at the
expense of the owner or occupant of the premises. The water may be shut off to
allow repairs to be made whenever notice is given that repairs are contemplated.
8. No meter shall be removed or disturbed without first having obtained permission
from the superintendent of public works.
9. Both classes of metered water service shall terminate when a duly authorized
official or employee of the village designated to read, inspect, test or repair meters
is denied permission to read, inspect, or test a meter, or repair or replace a meter
installed upon such premises. Such denial shall be construed to include failure by
the owner to remove any obstructions or encasements or any other interference
which would prevent reading, repairing or replacement of a water meter. Failure of
any owner to permit entry or access as hereinbefore set forth, after five (5) days'
written notice of the existence of such denial of access, shall result in the village
turning off the water service without further notice, and water service shall not be
again resumed until the terms and provisions of this section are fully complied with
to the satisfaction of the superintendent of public works, and a service charge of
twenty dollars ($20.00) is paid for resumption of service.

public or private garbage and refuse collection.
5. Any cuttings, trimmings or debris from trees, shrubs or other growing plant life.
F. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described
substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the village
and/or the MWRDGC that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment
process or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or can
otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming the
opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the village and the MWRDGC will give
consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and
velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage
treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of
wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and maximum limits established by regulatory
agencies. The substances prohibited are:

hp metric) or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the building
commissioner.
4. Any waters or waste containing strong acid, iron pickling wastes, or concentrated
plating solution whether neutralized or not.
5. Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, or similar
objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting any excessive chlorine
requirement to such degree that any such material received in the composite
sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established by the
MWRDGC for such materials.
6. Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor producing
substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by
the MWRDGC as necessary after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the
requirements of the state, federal, or other public agencies of jurisdiction for such
discharge to the receiving water.
7. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half life or concentration as may exceed
limits established by the MWRDGC in compliance with applicable state or federal
regulations.
8. Any wastes or waters having a pH in excess of 9.5.
9. Any mercury or any of its compounds in excess of 0.0005 mg/l Hg at any time

fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but
not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);
b. Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions);
c. Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such
quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works;
d. Unusual volume of flow or concentrations of wastes constituting "slugs" as
defined herein.
12. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or
reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to
treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot
meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters.
G. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public
sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics
enumerated in subsection F of this section, and/or are in violation of the standards for
pretreatment provided in 40 CFR 403, June 26, 1978 and any amendments thereto,
and which in the judgment of the MWRDGC may have a deleterious effect upon the
sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the MWRDGC may:
1. Reject the wastes;
2. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public
sewers;
3. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
4. Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating the wastes not
covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions of subsection M
of this section. If the MWRDGC permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to
the review and approval of the MWRDGC, and subject to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
H. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
MWRDGC they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease
in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients;
except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
MWRDGC, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.
I. Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his
expense.
J. Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when required by the
MWRDGC, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial
wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters
and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
MWRDGC. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be
maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
K. The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of waters and wastes to
illustrate compliance with this ordinance and any special conditions for discharge
established by the MWRDGC or regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
discharge.
The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the owner
shall be as stipulated by the MWRDGC, but no less than once per year the industry
must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater discharge to
assure that compliance with the federal, state, and local standards are being met.
The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the
MWRDGC at such times and in such a manner as prescribed by the MWRDGC.
The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses, and reporting
required by the MWRDGC. At such times as deemed necessary, the MWRDGC reserves
the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory
service.
L. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristic of waters and wastes to
which reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in accordance with the
latest edition of "IEPA Division Of Laboratories Manual Of Laboratory Methods", and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken
at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required the
control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty four (24)
hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or
samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty four (24) hours composites of all outfalls, whereas
pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.
M. No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the MWRDGC and any industrial concern whereby
an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the MWRDGC
for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in accordance with this chapter, hereof, by
the industrial concern provided such payments are in accordance with federal and
state guidelines for user charge system. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
7-5-4A: REGULATIONS REGARDING DOWNSPOUTS AND SUMP PUMP
CONNECTIONS TO SEWERS:
A. Downspouts and rainwater leaders, shall not be connected to any sanitary or combined
sewer within the village. Downspouts and rainwater leaders may be connected to
separate storm sewers with the prior approval of the community development
engineer.
1. All buildings or arts of buildings except as hereinafter provided, shall be provided
with proper rain leaders and eaves and cornice gutters for conducting rainwater
from the roof of structures to the ground surface or to an approved storm sewer in
such a manner as to protect the walls and foundations of the building and adjacent
structures from damage.
2. The following structures shall be exempt from the requirements of this section
provided that the roofs of such structures are so arranged as to allow roof water to
discharge on the premises upon which they are located and in such a manner that
said roof water shall not damage the same or adjoining properties, or become a
nuisance to the occupants of same.
a. Garages located on the rear of lots.
b. Porches or bay windows.
c. Residences without basements with twelve inches (12") or more of overhanging
eaves.
3. All buildings in zoning district R1, R2, R3 and all structures used as single- or multifamily
residences, equipped with exterior downspouts to direct rain water from the
gutters or scuppers shall have all downspout splash onto the ground surface and
be directed towards the front or rear of the building except for buildings located on
corner lots which shall discharge downspouts on the street side of the house
toward the public street. No storm water from said gutters shall discharge directly
into the sanitary sewer or combined sewer system of the village. Those residents
which currently have a pipe carrying roof water into the sanitary or combined
sewer system shall terminate the downspout or pipe at the ground surface or at
the nearest pipe joint. The pipe entering the ground shall be sealed with cement to
provide a positive disconnection of the downspout from the sanitary or combined
sewer. Splash blocks shall be provided to dissipate the discharge, and should be of
minimum dimension of twelve inches by thirty inches (12" x 30"), and of concrete
or other durable material and shall be firmly embedded to prevent displacement.
All downspouts and splash blocks shall be located in such a manner that said roof
water shall not damage the same of adjoining properties, or become a nuisance to
the occupants of said properties.
B. Sump pumps attached to footing and yard drains or drain tiles shall not be connected
to any sanitary sewer within the area of the village equipped with separate storm
sewers. No building permits shall be issued for any residential construction within the
corporate limits of the village which permits sump pumps used for footing or yard
drains to discharge into any sanitary or combined sewer in the village. All sump pumps
and ejector pumps used for sewage shall remain connected to the approved sanitary or
combined sewer. Sump pumps used for footing or yard drains may be connected to
discharge into separate storm sewer facilities with the approval of the community
development engineer.
C. Variances from the requirements of this chapter may be granted with regard to the
disconnection of downspouts and sump pump discharges in existing residential
properties in those cases where, in the opinion of the community development
engineer, such disconnections will create an associated store water hazard to the
building or part thereof or to a neighboring building. The community development
engineer may also grant exemptions from this chapter in cases where the
disconnection would cause clear and present hardship to the landholder. The village
administrator shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations describing
the procedure which is to be followed by an individual seeking such a variance from
the enforcement of the disconnection provisions of this chapter.
D. With regard to existing buildings required by this section to disconnect gutter
downspouts or sump pump discharges from the sanitary or combined sewers of the
village, property owners shall have all necessary disconnections be completed by July
1, 1987. The department of public works in cooperation with the building department
will serve written notice to property owners when violations of this section are
discovered. The absence of a written notice, however, will not affect a property owner's
responsibility to comply with all provisions of this chapter.
E. Should the requirements of this section conflict with other ordinances or portions of
ordinances in existence within the village, the ordinance establishing the highest
standard of performance shall prevail.
F. All new buildings shall include a domestic waste connection distinctly separate from the
building inflow connection in order to facilitate a disconnection to the combined sewer
system should a storm sewer become available. Each building connection location shall
be recorded on the final plat of and shall indicate the size and depth of the connection.
Any connection not in service shall be properly capped and sealed to prevent any
inflow from entering the system. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
7-5-5A: REFUSAL OF INSPECTION; COMPLIANCE WITH CORRECTION
ORDER:
A. It shall be the responsibility of each property owner to allow entry to his/her property
by the building commissioner or any other duly authorized employee of the village for
the purpose of inspection of the facilities within that property to determine where the
various sewer facilities empty or flow and to comply with any orders issued by the
building commissioner or any other duly authorized employees of the village regarding
the disconnects and rerouting of sump pump discharges or other connections which
cause clear water inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
B. Where a property owner fails or refuses entry to property by the building commissioner
or an authorized representative of the village of Morton Grove for the purpose of
inspection as provided herein, the village is empowered to shut off the water supply to
the property according to the shutoff policy of the village as follows:
Notification/
Water Shutoff Corrective Action/Time Frame
First notice Sent by mail after refusal of entry or expiration of time to make
needed repairs - provide 30 days to arrange for compliance.
Second notice Personal service or by return receipt requested mail - provide 15 days
to contact village and arrange for compliance.
Third notice Door hanger with 7 day shutoff notice.
Water shutoff Compliance and $50.00 fee to reestablish water service if water
service was reestablished on a weekday between 7:00 A.M. and 3:00
P.M. and $75.00 if the water was reestablished after 3:00 P.M. on
weekdays or any Saturday, Sunday or holiday.
(Ord. 98-10, 4-15-1998)
Where a property owner fails or refuses consent to the entry of his/her property for the
purpose of inspection as provided herein, the village shall also have authority through the
office of its corporation counsel to request a warrant from the circuit court of Cook County
authorizing the necessary inspection. Cause for issuance of a warrant shall be deemed to exist
in light of reasonable legislative and administrative standards which shows that a condition of
noncompliance exists with respect to a particular property in violation of this article. The court
may consider the visual observations of violations in plain view, citizen complaints, violations
apparent from existing village records of the property, documented violations of similar
properties in the area, previous violations on the property itself and the passage of time since
the property was last inspected.
C. In the event that a connection to the sanitary sewer system of any property within the
village is found to be in violation of the provisions of this chapter and particularly in
violation of the permissible connections or of the discharge requirements contained in
this chapter, then the building commissioner or duly authorized representatives of the
village shall furnish the property owner with a notice in writing setting forth the
substance of the violation giving the owner a period of sixty (60) days to correct the
violation. Compliance shall be ascertained by the building commissioner or his duly
authorized representative by further inspection as set forth in the notice.
In the event a violation is not corrected during the period of time set forth in the
violation notice or the building commissioner is not permitted to inspect the premises
to ascertain whether or not compliance has been achieved then the village may pursue
such legal remedies as it deems necessary to achieve compliance including, but not
limited to, court action to enjoin such violation and/or seeking of a fine as a penalty for
such violation and/or further administrative action following the procedures outlined in
subsection B of this section resulting in the shutoff of water service to the property in
question until the violation has been corrected. These remedies are not mutually
exclusive and the pursuance of one remedy does not preclude pursuance of one or
more additional remedies at the same time. (Ord. 91-58, 12-9-1991)
7-5-5: POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS:
A. The building commissioner and other duly authorized employees of the village, the
MWRDGC, the Illinois environmental protection agency, bearing proper credentials and
identification, shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
To protect the privacy of corporate interests, the building commissioner or his
representative shall have no authority to inquire into any processes, including
metallurgical, chemical, oil refining, ceramic, paper, or other industries beyond that
point having a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewers or
waterway or facilities for waste treatment.
B. While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in subsection A
of this section, the building commissioner or duly authorized employees of the village,
the MWRDGC, the Illinois environmental protection agency, and the U.S. environmental
protection agency shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established
by the company and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the
village employees and the village shall indemnify the company against liability claims
and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company
and growing out of the gauging and sampling operating, except as such may be
caused by negligence or failure of the company to maintain conditions as required in
subsection 7-5-4K of this chapter.
C. The building commissioner and other duly authorized employees of the village, bearing
proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all private properties
through which the village holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but
not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sample, repair, and maintenance
of any portion of the sewage works lying within said easement. All entry and
subsequent work, if any, on said easement, shall be done in full accordance with the
terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved.
(Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
7-5-6: SEWER RATES; PAYMENT OF FEES:
The corporate authorities shall establish by ordinance a rate to be charged for sewer services
to be paid by all water customers in the village. Said sewer charges shall be assessed based
on the volume of water provided to said water customer and shall include a minimum charge.
Sewer charges shall be included on the water bill and shall be due when said water bill is due.
(Ord. 05-53, 12-12-2005)
A. Basis For Sewer Charges: The sewer service charge for the use of and for service
supplied by the wastewater collection facilities of the village of Morton Grove shall
consist of a basic user charge, a debt service charge, a transfer charge and a credit as
computed in subsection D of this section.
B. Basic User Charge: The basic user charge is levied on all users to recover the
operation, maintenance plus replacement (OM&R) costs and is computed by
apportioning the annual (OM&R) costs as a charge per one thousand (1,000) gallons.
C. Debt Service Charge: The "debt service charge" as defined in subsection 7-5-10C of
this chapter is computed by apportioning the annual debt service as a charge per one
thousand (1,000) gallons.
D. Computation Of Sewer Service Charge: The sewer service charge shall be computed by
the following formula:
CS = (UC + DS + TC - C) Vf
Where:
CS=The sewer service charge as defined in subsection A of this section.
US=The basic user charge as defined in subsection B of this section.
DS=The debt service charge as defined in subsection C of this section.
TC=The transfer charge, if any, to subsidize debt on other sewer projects.
C=The credit, if any, for the difference between monies collected from interest income
or other available revenue sources and the amount by which projected revenues
exceed expenditures.
Vf=The volume of flow in one thousand (1,000) gallons as measured in accordance
with subsection F of this section.
For the period from May 1, 1990, to April 30, 1991, the following rates shall apply:
UC= 25 .6 cents/1,000 gallons
DC= 11 .5 cents/1,000 gallons
TC= 13 .6 cents/1,000 gallons
C= 0 .7 cents/1,000 gallons
The adequacy of the sewer service charge will be reviewed annually by the village
administrator and the finance director during the village's fiscal year budgeting
process. The sewer service charge will be revised to reflect any changes in OM&R, debt
service, and transfer costs and any credit.
E. Annual Rate Notification: The user of the wastewater collection facilities will be notified
annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the sewer

employees and staff, and any experts, consultants, investigators or attorneys hired
by the village to review, investigate, present at hearing, or otherwise work for the
village concerning the petition, all constitute one participant. To the extent the
village employees and staff wish to participate in the public hearings outside their
roles or employment with the village, they must submit a notice of participation, as
do other members of the public.
3. Other Participants: Any person other than described in subsections E1 and E2 of
this section must file a written "notice of participation" on a form supplied by the
village clerk notifying the village clerk and counsel for the applicant of that
person's or entity's intent to participate.
a. Every notice of participation must be filed with the village clerk before the
adjournment of the first day of public hearing. In the case of counsel of record
for any participant, said counsel shall, on or before the eightieth day from the
date of filing, serve a letter upon the village clerk and upon counsel for the
applicant entering his or her appearance for the participant.
b. Every notice of participation shall provide the following information: the name,
address, daytime phone number and, if available, facsimile number of the
participant or counsel; whether the participant will be participating on his/her
own behalf or as a representative/spokesperson of another person or entity

entity); whether the person (or the entity or association he/she represents) will
be represented by an attorney during the public hearings; and whether the
person intends on providing oral testimony or comment during the public
hearing. All members of the public who desire to present sworn testimony,
unsworn comment, or submit written questions to the hearing officer must file a
notice of participation.
c. No person may become a participant after the first day of the hearing except
for good cause shown. The hearing officer shall liberally interpret this limitation
if the additional participation shall not delay the process or unfairly prejudice a
prior participant. No late participant shall be entitled to recall a witness who has
previously testified.
4. Participant Rights: Participants have the right to present sworn testimony and
witnesses. Participants represented by counsel have the right to cross examine or
question witnesses who provide sworn testimony. Participants who are not
represented by counsel may provide witnesses, evidence and sworn testimony
subject to cross examination by others; provide unsworn testimony or comment
during the public hearing (subject to the hearing officer's judgment and consistent
with fundamental fairness); or, as is the case for members of the public generally,
submit written questions to the hearing officer who, in his/her sole discretion, shall
decide whether such questions shall be posed and the manner of posing such
questions. Participants who are not represented by counsel shall not cross examine
witnesses directly.
5. Attorneys: Any attorneys acting as counsel and representing a participant must be
licensed and in good standing to practice law in the state of Illinois, or if licensed
and in good standing to practice law in another state which is part of the United
States, shall be allowed to serve as a counsel for a participant upon motion made
to and granted by the hearing officer.
6. Witnesses: All witnesses (other than those called purely for purposes of rebuttal)
and the subject matter on which they will testify shall be disclosed, and all reports,
studies, exhibits or other evidence, or copies thereof, that any person, other than
the applicant, desires to submit as evidence for the record at the public hearing
must be filed with the village clerk and with counsel for the applicant no later than
eighty (80) days after the date of filing of the application. In the event the eightieth
day after the date of filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the next
business day shall be considered the date by which all such information must be
filed. Copies of all such information shall also be available for copying by the public
upon the payment of the actual costs of reproduction. Evidence or witnesses not so
disclosed by the required date shall be admissible at the hearing only where the
hearing officer shall find the admission of such evidence is necessary to provide
fundamental fairness to the parties.
F. Public Hearings:
1. Determination Of Date, Time And Location: The public hearing shall be held no

later than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of filing. The public
hearing shall be at such times and places as is convenient for the public generally
but shall be conducted so as to comply with the statutory requirement the village
render a decision prior to the one hundred eightieth day from the date of filing, and
accounting for the thirty (30) day period for written comment following the close of
the public hearing, with due time for the corporate authorities to deliberate and

from the date of filing. Said notices, which may be in lowercase, shall consist of
the following:
(1) The name and address of the applicant;
(2) The owners of the site and, if ownership is in a land trust, the names of the
beneficiaries of said trust;
(3) Legal descriptions of the property and the facility boundary, with each

section except for subsection F2a(3) of this section.
3. Hearing Procedures:
a. Hearing Officer: The village's corporation counsel shall designate a licensed
attorney to act as a hearing officer to preside over the public hearing, and the
hearing officer shall make any decisions concerning the admission of evidence
and the manner in which the hearing is conducted, subject to this section. The
hearing officer shall make all decisions and rulings in accordance with
fundamental fairness. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial,
incompetent or unduly repetitious testimony or other evidence. All testimony
and all public meetings concerning the petition shall be in the presence of a
certified court reporter who shall report all proceedings regarding consideration
of the petition. The hearing officer shall have the following powers or duties:
(1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
(2) Conduct a public meeting, prior to the start of the public hearings, to
explain the public hearing procedure and site location review process;

that were not reasonably foreseeable to the party requesting the recess. No
recess may extend past five (5) days except due to the availability of a
suitable forum for the hearing;

testimony and questioning;
(8) Rule upon objections and evidentiary questions, with the understanding
such rulings must be consistent with fundamental fairness, but need not be
in strict compliance with the Illinois supreme court, Illinois code of civil
procedure, or any local rules of evidence governing a civil judicial trial in the
state of Illinois;
(9) Allow the introduction of late filed evidence, be it written or testimonial, on
behalf of any participant, provided good cause is shown for the late filing,
the evidence is offered in and is relevant to the rebuttal portion of the
applicant's or participant's case, and evidence was filed with the village
clerk at least one day before the public hearing at which it is offered, and
fundamental fairness to all parties will be preserved;
(10) The hearing officer shall be an attorney, licensed to practice in Illinois. The
hearing officer shall confer with the village board concerning the petition,
between the date of filing of the petition and the board's decision on the
petition. Given the hearing officer's role of communicating with the village
board, the hearing officer may not confer with the participants (members of
the public, applicant and village included) concerning the petition, unless
such conference takes place during the public hearing, is through
correspondence which is filed with the village clerk (and, thus, available for
everyone to view), or concerns location, time or other similar scheduling
aspects of the public meeting or public hearing, or the notices for same. The
only additional exception from this restriction is the hearing officer may
confer with the village clerk about the upkeep or status of the public record,
make a request to review or copy the public record, or confer with the

village staff may then make an opening statement;
(10) The village board shall then hear testimony from the applicant and/or any
witnesses the applicant may wish to call. Upon the close of the applicant's
testimony, participants represented by counsel may present sworn
testimony, including any witnesses and evidence they wish to present. Upon
the close of all such testimony, the village may present sworn testimony,
including witnesses and evidence it may wish to present. The hearing
officer, in the exercise of his or her discretion, may then permit rebuttal
testimony and surrebuttal testimony;

appropriateness of the proposed facility, or its compliance with the
requirements of section 39.2 of the act, with the village clerk, at any time
after the filing of a petition and within the time limitation provided in
subsection F3c(4) of this section. Likewise, the applicant, village staff, the
corporation counsel and/or any participant may file draft proposed findings
of fact within the same time limitation;
(2) The village clerk, on behalf of the village board, shall receive written
comment or draft findings of fact and the clerk shall date stamp same, shall

section, the village infrastructure maintenance fee authorized hereunder shall be
the only fee or compensation for the use of all public rights of way within the
village by telecommunications retailers. Imposition of the infrastructure
maintenance fee provided under this section does not, however, serve as a
limitation on the levying of any taxes or imposition of any fees otherwise
authorized by law.

village's office of the finance director/treasurer, a remittance return and remit the
municipal infrastructure fee to the village for the preceding calendar month.
4. Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant to this
chapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by such
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the village. The charge imposed under this section
by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this chapter shall constitute a debt
of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who provides such services
until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original
charge for such services.
5. If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee has been paid
that was not due under the provisions of this chapter, whether as a result of a
mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any
infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due, under this chapter, from
the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous payment; provided,
however, the village finance director/treasurer may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such credit.
However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three years after the
date of the erroneous payment unless: a) the credit is used only to offset a claim of
underpayment made by the village within the applicable statutory period of
limitations, and b) the credit derives from an overpayment made by the same
telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of limitations.
6. Amounts paid under this chapter by telecommunications retailers shall not be
included in the tax base under any of the following acts as described immediately
below:
a. "Gross charges" for purposes of the telecommunications excise tax act;

prescribed in section 8-11-17 of the Illinois municipal code;
d. "Gross revenue" for purposes of the tax on annual gross revenue of public
utilities prescribed in section 2-202 of the public utilities act.
7. The village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the books and records of
all telecommunications retailers subject to this chapter to determine whether the
telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the village for the village
infrastructure maintenance fees. Any underpayment of the amount of the village
infrastructure maintenance fee due to the village by the telecommunications
retailer shall be paid to the village plus five percent (5%) of the total amount of the
underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by the village in
conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit. Said sum shall be paid to the
village within twenty one (21) days after the date of issuance of an invoice for
same.
8. The village finance director/treasurer, or his or her designee, may promulgate such
further or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of
this chapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to time
and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered pursuant to
section 7-8-3 of this chapter of such regulations.
C. Compliance With Other Laws: Nothing in this chapter shall excuse any person or entity
from obligations imposed under any law, including, but not limited to:
1. Generally applicable taxes; and
2. Standards for construction on, over, under, or within, use of or repair of the public
rights of way, including standards relating to freestanding towers and other

structures not located on, over, or within the right of way.
D. Existing Franchises And Licenses: Any franchise, license, or similar agreements
between telecommunications retailers and the village entered into before the effective
date of this chapter regarding the use of public rights of way shall remain valid
according to and for their stated terms except for any fees, charges or other
compensation which shall be waived as stated below:
1. The village hereby waives all fees, charges, and other compensation that may
accrue, after the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee (IMF) by a
telecommunications retailer pursuant to any existing village franchise, license, or
similar agreement with a telecommunications retailer. This waiver shall only be
effective during the time the IMF provided for in this chapter is subject to being
lawfully imposed on the telecommunications retailer and collected by the
telecommunications retailer from the customer.
2. The village administrator shall send a notice of the waiver by certified mail/return
receipt requested to each telecommunications retailer with whom the village has
an existing franchise, license, or similar agreement that the village waives all
compensation under such existing franchise, license, or similar agreement during
such time as the IMF is subject to being lawfully imposed and collected by the
retailer and remitted to the village. The infrastructure maintenance fee shall apply
to gross charges billed on or after the effective date as established in the
ordinance.

CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC
RIGHTS OF WAY
7-9-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and procedures for
constructing facilities on rights of way within the village's jurisdiction, which will
provide public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and
visual qualities of the village rights of way and the village as a whole.
B. Intent: In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its authority over the
rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property
by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility
facilities, including, without limitation:
1. Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other
public ways and places;
2. Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that
are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
3. Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the village's utilities and
of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or public property;
4. Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the
installation of utility facilities;
5. Protect against increased storm water runoff due to structures and materials that
increase impermeable surfaces;
6. Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed;
7. Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that characterize the
village's residential neighborhoods;
8. Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights of way; and
9. Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to
utility facilities locations.
C. Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all facilities on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of way within the jurisdiction of the
village. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this chapter may
continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently
constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable
franchise, license or similar agreement.
D. Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The village, in its discretion and as
limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar
agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon,
under, across, or within the village rights of way. Utilities that are not required by law
to enter into such an agreement may request that the village enter into such an
agreement. In such an agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions
inconsistent with this chapter.
E. Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
1. Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that a utility other
than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or similar agreement
with the village, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and
control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension
thereof.
2. Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency
between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any franchise, license
or similar agreement between the village and any telecommunications provider,
the provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and
control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension
thereof.
F. Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or parts of chapters
adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.
G. Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable federal or state
laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this chapter, the utility shall
comply with the requirements of this chapter to the maximum extent possible without
violating federal or state laws or regulations.
H. Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering judgment when
administering this chapter and may vary the standards, conditions, and requirements
expressed in this chapter when the village so determines. The village engineer or the
director of public works or his/her designee may from time to time establish policies
which waive or modify any requirement of this chapter if he/she determines that
compliance with such requirement would create an undue burden and that such
compliance is not necessary to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the village or its
residents. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the village to regulate
its rights of way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 07-29,

1. Pursuant to section 4 of the telephone company act, 220 Illinois Compiled Statutes
65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that it intends to
commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications, and
other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the
facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the village
not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work requiring no
excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of work
requiring excavation. The village engineer or the director of public works or his/her
designee shall specify the portion of the right of way upon which the facility may
be placed, used and constructed.
2. In the event that the village engineer or the director of public works or his/her
designee fails to provide such specification of location to the telecommunications
retailer within either: a) ten (10) days after service of notice to the village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new
construction, or b) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter.
3. Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a permit is required
for work pursuant to section 7-9-4 of this chapter, the telecommunications retailer
shall submit to the village an application for a permit and any and all plans,

application, specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in
the application. The review period as stated in Chapter 12-3-6G.2 herein below shall be
tolled from the date of notification and shall begin running again when the applicant
makes a supplemental submission in response to the notice of deficiencies. Following a
supplemental submission, the Village will notify the applicant within ten (10) calendar
days the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the
original notice delineating missing information. The review period is tolled in the case
of a second or subsequent notice pursuant to the procedures hereinabove. Upon
determination, all information requested by the Village for the application has been
received, the tolling period shall resume. (Ord 16-06; 3-28-16)
7-9-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
A. Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A permit from the
village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with
this chapter on village rights of way, and does not create a property right or grant
authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an
interest in the rights of way.
B. Duration: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than six
(6) months unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion.
C. Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit
issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major
contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a
preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held at a date, time
and place designated by the village with such village representatives in attendance as
the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the
work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas
where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility
facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights of way by the public during construction, and access and egress
by adjacent property owners.
D. Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the village does not
excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the village and
applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. (Ord. 07-29, 10-8-2007)
7-9-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the
locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit
application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations
approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements
of this chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section 7-9-21
of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either
remove the facility from the right of way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the
permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. (Ord. 07-29, 10-8-2007)
7-9-8: INSURANCE:
A. Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or
similar agreement, each utility occupying right of way or constructing any facility in the
right of way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring
the utility as named insured and naming the village, and its elected and appointed
officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
subsections A1 and A2 of this section:
1. Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations, explosion,
collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to as "X", "C", and "U"
coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than:

4. Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and
subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors
shall comply with this section.
B. Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may be in any
combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy
must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following form basis
such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the
primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.
C. Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this
section to the village within ten (10) days following receipt of a written request therefor
from the village.
D. Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies required by
this section shall contain the following endorsement:

than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the
village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this
section.
E. Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and
limit requirements required by subsection A of this section. A utility that self-insures is
not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for
the naming of additional insureds under subsection A of this section, or the
requirements of subsections B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to selfinsure
shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability
to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection
A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer" under the
workers' compensation act.
F. Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The legal liability of the
utility to the village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the
insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such
insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
G. Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected
under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct
business with the licensee in the state of Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line
carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best

defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected and appointed officials and officers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and
costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from
the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility
or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction
of facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter
or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity
obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages,
losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of
this chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. (Ord.
07-29, 10-8-2007)
7-9-10: SECURITY:
A. Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as
set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in
accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the
completion of the work authorized under the permit. The security fund shall serve as
security for:
1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the
permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits
and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses
that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by
permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to
public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this chapter to
perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence
solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments
due the village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable
law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the
permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an
unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or
letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the
permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any
amounts covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the state of Illinois at
which it can be drawn.
C. Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the
reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at least as good a condition as
that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the village
engineer or the director of public works or his/her designee, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities
proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the
village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a
related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or
phases, the village engineer or the director of public works or his/her designee may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit.
The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest
amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any
single phase.
D. Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this
subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the fourteen (14) day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the
village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village determines can
be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee
shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C of this section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in
the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for
said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the
security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection C of this section.
G. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under
the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such
portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken
for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to
comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein,
shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any
reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation,
provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund
are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this chapter or
otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with
respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary
recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

works or his/her designee may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the
variance has demonstrated that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features
or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship that would make
enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be
achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform
with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation
to the requested approach.
D. Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for authorizing a
variance, the village engineer or the director of public works or his/her designee may
require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.

10-13-6: COMPLAINT PROCEDURE:
The rules contained in the new "Robert's Rules Of Order" shall govern in all cases in which
they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with this chapter or the special
rules of order as set forth below.
A. Filing Of Complaint:
1. Any person(s) aggrieved in any manner by a violation of any provision of this
chapter may file with the village administrator a written complaint setting forth the
grievance within ninety (90) days after the date of the alleged violation. The

and address of the person against whom the complaint is brought, if known to the
complainant, and c) the alleged facts surrounding the alleged violation of this
chapter; and such complaint shall state the name and address of all persons
believed to have knowledge concerning the alleged acts. The complaint shall be
filed on the form provided by the commission and available in the office of the
village administrator.
2. The village administrator shall notify the chair of the community relations
commission and the staff liaison to the commission of the complaint. The chair of
the community relations commission shall notify the chair of the fair housing
committee to set a committee conference to review the complaint after the
"preliminary fact finding" is completed.
B. Preliminary Fact Finding:
1. The chair of the fair housing committee shall contact the complainant by telephone
within five (5) business days of the filing for review and elaboration of the
information contained in the written complaint. If the complainant cannot be
contacted by telephone within the five (5) business day period, a certified letter,
return receipt requested, shall be sent indicating the necessity for the complainant
to communicate with the chair within five (5) business days of the receipt of the
certified letter or the complaint shall be deemed to be withdrawn.
2. After speaking with the complainant the chair of the fair housing committee shall
determine whether the complaint describes an action which may be a violation of
the fair housing ordinance according to the procedure set forth below:
a. If the chair of the fair housing committee believes the complaint is deemed to
possibly have merit:
(1) The chair of the fair housing committee shall attempt to contact the
respondent by telephone within five (5) business days after contact with the
complainant to notify the respondent that a complaint has been filed.
Subsequently, the chair of the fair housing committee shall provide the
respondent a copy of the filed complaint via certified mail, return receipt
requested, and request a written response on the form provided within
seven (7) business days via trackable mail. If the chair cannot contact the
respondent by telephone within five (5) business days, contact will be
attempted by certified mail, return receipt requested, with response
required within seven (7) business days after receipt of the certified letter. If
the certified letter is undeliverable, messenger service of the
communication will be utilized and the respondent will be given seven (7)
business days to respond in writing to the attention of the chair of the fair
housing committee. Finally, the complainant shall be advised to seek the
assistance of either state or federal fair housing agencies to further
prosecute their complaint.
(2) The chair of the fair housing committee shall recontact the complainant with
a status report should the attempt to obtain a response from the respondent
be delayed. Within five (5) business days after receipt of written response
from the respondent, the chair will provide the complainant a copy of the
respondent's response and discuss the information obtained from the
respondent in a personal meeting with each party.
(3) If the complainant determines within seven (7) business days that the
respondent's response resolves the complaint, the complainant will be
asked to withdraw the complaint by signing the complaint form as directed.
Two (2) copies of the form will be sent to the complainant by certified mail,
with the request that one copy be executed and returned to the village for
its records within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of the forms. If the
form is not returned by the thirtieth day after the form has been received,
the matter will be considered resolved and shall be so noted on the original
complaint form.
(4) When the complaint is withdrawn, the chair will notify the respondent in
writing within five (5) business days. The chair shall report on the complaint
disposition to the full commission at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
(5) If the complainant determines within seven (7) business days that the
respondent's response is not satisfactory, the chair shall take both the
complaint and the response to the fair housing committee within seven (7)
business days of receipt of the written response from the respondent for
verification that a violation of the fair housing ordinance may have been
committed.
(6) Following verification that a violation of the fair housing ordinance has been
committed and the chair of the fair housing committee believes that the
activity prompting the complaint will continue to occur, he/she shall relay
such evidence to the board of trustees within five (5) business days,
together with a recommendation that the corporation counsel be instructed
to seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prohibit such
violation. Upon receipt of the chair's recommendation, the board shall make
a determination within five (5) business days. If the board concurs with the
chair's recommendation, the board shall instruct the corporation counsel to
seek immediate injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
prohibit such violation.
(7) If the fair housing committee concurs that a violation of the fair housing
ordinance may have occurred, a conciliation conference shall be scheduled
no less than ten (10) business days nor more than thirty (30) days from the
conclusion of the fact finding (see subsection C of this section).
b. If the chair of the fair housing committee believes that the complaint describes
an action which is not considered to be a violation of the fair housing ordinance:
(1) The chair of the fair housing committee shall meet with the fair housing
committee within ten (10) business days of the contact with the
complainant to render a final decision if a violation of the fair housing
ordinance has occurred.
(2) If the fair housing committee concurs that a violation did not occur, all
further action shall terminate with notice to the complainant by certified
mail. After such notice, the complainant shall petition the community
relations commission as a whole for review of the findings of the committee.
(3) If the fair housing committee believes that a violation did occur, it shall
direct its chair to complete the fact finding (as described in this section).

other cause, is unable to testify before the commission, or its members or agents
conducting the hearing or investigation, that witness' testimony or deposition may
be taken within or outside of the state, in such manner and in such form as the
commission may prescribe. The complainant and the respondent may each be

generated. This stage usually occurs both before and after caucus.
e. Caucus: Private, confidential meetings between the conciliation panel and
individual parties or groupings of parties as decided by the chair.
f. Concluding The Conciliation: The stage at which the chair decides to stop the

STANDARDS FOR BOARDING UP VACANT AND OCCUPIED
STRUCTURES IN ALL ZONING DISTRICTS
10-14-1: BOARD UP REQUEST; PERMIT REQUIRED:
From time to time in order to protect a structure from the elements or to ensure the security
of a structure the owner or the owner's agent may deem it appropriate to board up windows
or door openings. Prior to boarding up the window or door openings in any vacant or occupied
structure located in any zoning district, the owner and/or the owner's agent shall contact the
building department and request a permit to install boarding under the procedures and
standards outlined in this chapter. The building commissioner shall review all requests to
board up the door and window openings in structures and shall issue a permit, therefore, only
under the procedures and standards established in this chapter. Should damage occur to a
structure during the nighttime hours, on weekends or at other times when the building
commissioner is not available, the owner or the owner's agent may apply boarding as
provided for in this chapter provided that application is made for a permit during the first
business day following the board up action. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
10-14-2: BOARD UP PERMIT; REVIEW PROCEDURES; ISSUANCE OR
DENIAL:
The building commissioner shall review each board up permit application to determine the
potential for vandalism, structural damage due to exposure to rain, wind and other elements
of nature, the security of the structure, the overall security and aesthetic impact on the
neighborhood and the need to provide light and ventilation for occupants. If the building
commissioner agrees following his investigation that boarding up some or all of the window
and door openings in a structure will best serve to protect the structure, the safety and
welfare of the occupants, and the overall safety and security of the neighborhood, a board up
permit shall be issued to the owner or the owner's agent and work may commence
immediately to board up the structure under the standards established in this chapter. If
however, the building commissioner determines that boarding up window and door openings
is not necessary to protect the structure, or may threaten the health, safety and welfare of
residents or may adversely impact the neighborhood, a board up permit shall be denied and
the owner or the owner's agent shall be instructed to proceed immediately with normal
window and door repairs so that the structure will remain safe and secure and impervious to
the elements. Such repairs to be accomplished as provided for in the relevant sections of this
code. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
10-14-3: BOARD UP PERMIT; DURATION; EXTENSION:
No board up permit shall be issued for a period greater than one hundred twenty (120) days.
The owner or the owner's agent of a structure that has been boarded up at window or door
who anticipates a need to have the boarding remain for a period in excess of one hundred
twenty (120) days shall in writing to the building department request an extension of the
board up permit. Each extension request shall include a detailed explanation of why the
construction and/or reconstruction, repair and reoccupancy of the building cannot be
accomplished within the original one hundred twenty (120) day permit period and include a
time table as to when the construction, repair or reoccupancy will occur. The building
commissioner after reviewing a request for an extension of a board up permit may grant the
requested extension for a period not to exceed sixty (60) additional days. Under extraordinary
circumstances, in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, the building
commissioner may grant monthly extensions of the board up permit thereafter. The building
commissioner shall forward copies of all board up permit extension requests along with any
relevant information regarding the request or the building commissioner's findings regarding
whether or not an extension of the permit should be granted to the appearance commission.
(Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
10-14-4: BOARD UP OF WINDOWS AND DOORS; WHEN REQUIRED:
When necessary for causes due to wind damage, fire, vandalism or accident, the building
commissioner may order any part or all of the openings at window and door of a structure to
be securely boarded as per the standards provided for in this chapter. Whenever the building
commissioner deems it necessary that all of, or portions of the building be boarded at window
or door, written notice shall be provided to the owner or the owner's agent advising that the
building must be secure within seventy two (72) hours as shall be deemed appropriate under
the circumstances by the building commissioner. A board up order shall be issued on a
standardized form similar to the form used for granting board up permits and shall contain the
relevant information regarding the one hundred twenty (120) day time period which shall
constitute the normal permit period under the provisions of this chapter. The owner and/or the
owner's agent shall also be notified of the repairs required to the structure so that the
boarding can be removed at the appropriate time as well as the procedure for securing an
extension of the board up permit should circumstances warrant. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
10-14-5: EMERGENCY BOARD UP PROVISIONS:
On occasion the building commissioner may determine that a vacant structure open at door or
window poses a significant threat to the health and welfare of any person who might enter
upon the premises. The commissioner is hereby authorized to provide the owner or the
owner's agent with written or verbal notice that the building must be secured through board
up or repair of existing door and windows within twenty four (24) hours of the notice. Should
the owner or the owner's agent of a vacant structure, determined by the building
commissioner to be an emergency hazard fail to respond within the twenty four (24) hour
period of time the building commissioner shall be authorized to have the building secured by
village forces or outside contractors, the cost to be borne by the property owner. In such
event, the cost of such boarding shall be and constitute a lien upon such real estate upon
notice of same being recorded at the office of the recorder of deeds or registered at the office
of the registrar of titles. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
10-14-6: BOARD UP STANDARDS:
All exterior openings to buildings boarded up under the provisions of this chapter shall be
completed in a neat and workmanlike manner with not less than one-half inch (1/2") thick
weather resistant plywood cut to fit within the openings. The plywood shall be securely
fastened in place, and suitably coated with an appropriate neutral color which will have the
effect of blending the board up material with or complementing the existing exterior colors of
the building. The coating applied shall render the boarding used to cover door and window
openings as inconspicuous as possible. Boarding up work once commenced following issuance
of a permit, shall be completed, including the application of an appropriate, neutral color to
the exterior side of the boarding material without delay or interruption. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
10-14-7: NOTICE OF NONCOMPLIANCE:
It shall be the duty of the building commissioner to notify the owner or the agent of any
vacant structure not complying with the above requirements of the necessity for compliance
and providing written notice requiring the timely compliance with the provisions of this
chapter. (Ord. 85-1, 1-25-1985)
10-14-8: PENALTY:
A responsible owner or agent of owner or occupant of such real estate shall be subject to a
penalty in accordance with title 1, chapter 4 of this code for each day such violation exists
following the expiration time as specified in any notice either written or verbal issued by the
building commissioner requiring compliance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 08-22,

DEVELOPMENT CODE. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-1-2: JURISDICTION:
These regulations shall apply to all developments existing and planned within the
incorporated limits of the village. These regulations shall also apply to any subdivision
situated in unincorporated Cook County which is located entirely or in part within one and
one-half (11/2) miles of the corporate limits of the village.
In the event of an overlap between the one and one-half (11/2) mile extraterritorial jurisdiction
of Morton Grove, and that of a neighboring municipality and in the absence of a boundary
agreement between the village and such other municipality, the village's extraterritorial
jurisdiction shall extend to an equidistant point between it and any such municipality as
provided in section 11-12-9 of the Illinois municipal code, 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes
5/11-12-9. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-1-3: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this title is to provide a comprehensive set of land use and development
regulations for the development of land within one and one-half (11/2) miles of the village's
corporate boundaries. These regulations are designed to provide for orderly and harmonious
new development and redevelopment. Because each new development accepted by the
village becomes a permanent unit in the physical structure of the community, this title is
adopted for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, comfort, morals, convenience,
and general welfare by:
A. Ensuring adequate natural light, air, privacy, access to property, and safety from fire,
explosion, noxious fumes, noise and other dangers.
B. Conserving the taxable value of land and buildings in the village.
C. Encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the village.
D. Dividing the entire village of Morton Grove into districts and restricting and regulating
therein the location, construction, reconstruction, alteration, and use of buildings,
structures, and land, whether for residence, commercial, manufacturing, or other
specified uses.
E. Preventing the overcrowding of land through regulating and limiting the intensity of
land development, and the height and bulk of buildings.
F. Prohibiting uses, buildings, or structures incompatible with the character of the
residential, commercial or manufacturing districts.
G. Preventing additions to, alterations or remodeling of existing buildings and structures
that are contrary to the restrictions and limitations imposed under this title.
H. Providing for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses of land, buildings, or
structures.
I. Establishing and maintaining a coordinated system of streets, services, and utilities.
J. Preserving open space and natural resources and amenities.

The provisions of this title are informed by and derived from the codes it now supersedes,
including the village's zoning code, subdivision code, flood damage prevention ordinance, and
appearance code. This title also derives from the same statutory sources of power as those
previous codes. This title does not, however, abrogate any easement, covenant, or other
private agreement or recorded restrictions. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-1-5: RELATIONSHIP TO OFFICIAL COMPREHENSIVE PLAN:
It is the intention that the planning policies adopted in this title be in general conformance
with the policies in the official comprehensive plan of the village, including those policies
contained within the Waukegan Road commercial corridor master plan, Lehigh/Ferris subarea
plan, and the Dempster Street corridor master plan. Neither this title nor any amendments to
it may be challenged on the basis of any alleged nonconformity with the official
comprehensive plan. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)

G. Special Regulations For Commercial Wireless Communication Services:
1. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide specific regulations for the
placement, construction and modification of commercial wireless communications
services. In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and
businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
community these regulations are necessary in order to:
a. Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunications services to the residents
of the village, as well as to other persons, firms, and/or corporations in the
vicinity of the village;
b. Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and siting
standards;
c. Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through
structural standards and setback requirements; and
d. Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to
accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the
number of towers needed to serve the community.
2. Interpretation:
a. The provisions of these regulations are not intended to and shall not be
interpreted or applied so as to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of commercial wireless communication services, nor shall the
provisions of this section be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably
discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent commercial wireless
communication services. To the extent that any provision or provisions of these
regulations are inconsistent or in conflict with any provision of this code, the
provisions of these regulations shall be deemed to control.
b. In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required under this
section made by an applicant to provide or to install commercial wireless
communication service antenna, antenna support structure, and/or ancillary
equipment, the plan commission or the board of trustees, as the case may be,
shall act within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with
the village, taking into account the nature and scope of the request, and any
decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and supported by substantial
evidence contained in a written record.
c. No decision to deny an application for a special use permit or a zoning variation
for the construction or installation of a commercial wireless communication
service antenna, antenna support structure and/or ancillary equipment may be
based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent
that such facility complies with the FCCs regulations concerning such
emissions.
3. Use:
a. Commercial wireless communication services shall be specifically prohibited in
residential zones except as accessory uses on nonresidential properties such as
schools, parks, utility owned and municipal property, and houses of worship.
b. Commercial wireless communication services shall be considered permitted
accessory uses, except in locations as prohibited above, as long as they meet
the height requirements set forth in subsection A, "Height Restrictions", of this
section.
c. Commercial wireless communication services exceeding the height limit in
subsection A of this section shall require a special use permit.
d. Commercial wireless communication services may be considered a principal
use on a zoning lot in manufacturing districts, and upon issuance of a special
use permit, in commercial districts. The special use conditions identified below
shall apply in addition to the seven (7) standards by which a special use is
evaluated.
4. Special Use Evaluation Criteria: In addition to the standard conditions for which a
special use permit may be granted, the following considerations shall also be
addressed:
a. The extent to which the height differs from the permitted height;
b. Proximity of facility to and effect on adjacent structures;
c. Design of antenna, antenna support structure, and any ancillary equipment,
with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of
reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
d. Availability of suitable existing towers and structures, upon which the antenna
can be located, and documentation indicating why the antenna cannot be
located there;
e. Based on the above special use criteria, the plan commission may recommend,
and the board of trustees may require, commercial wireless communication
service support structures to allow for collocation from other users to take
place. The applicant shall consent to allow other users and demonstrate the
ability to collocate. Demonstrated ability shall include, but not be limited to,
landlord approval if proposed support structure is to be located on leased
property; commercially reasonable sublease agreement; and facility of
sufficient size and structurally designed to accept collocations.
f. The village may hire, if it deems necessary, an independent technical expert to
review and evaluate any special use application for a proposed commercial
wireless communication service antenna, antenna support structure, and
ancillary equipment for servicing. The applicant shall pay the costs of said
review, including any administrative costs incurred by the village.
5. Compliance: All commercial wireless communication services shall comply with
subsection B, "Location On Parcel", subsection D3, and subsection C, "Screening",
of this section.
6. Number Restriction: All commercial wireless communication services shall be
limited to one installation per zoning lot, with the following exceptions:
a. Collocation is allowed for the site by special use, as deemed necessary or
desirable by the village.
b. The applicant applies for a special use permit to allow for additional
installation(s). The special use criteria identified in this title shall apply.
7. Building Permit Required: It shall be unlawful for any person to install, construct or
increase the height of any commercial wireless communication service without first
obtaining a building permit. Applications for a building permit shall be made upon
such forms requested by the village and shall have attached thereto the following
items:
a. A location plan for the commercial wireless communication services, with
screening indicated.
b. Manufacturer's specifications for the commercial wireless communication
services, and details of footings, guys, and braces.
c. Foundation, tower structure, and antenna plans certified to be adequate by an
Illinois licensed structural engineer.
8. Services In Existence: All commercial wireless communication services existing on
the effective date hereof shall be considered lawful uses. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-3-7: ABOVEGROUND STORAGE TANKS:
All aboveground storage tanks shall meet the standards set forth by the Morton Grove fire
code (title 9, chapter 4, article A of this code) and Morton Grove building code (title 10 of this
code). (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-3-8: TEMPORARY TRAILERS:

12-4-3: COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS:
A. Statement Of Purpose: The regulation of the commercial districts is intended to control
the development of commercial uses needed to provide the people of the village with
goods and services. The regulation of these uses is based upon their impact on public
facilities and their compatibility with other types of uses. Protection of the capacity and
safety characteristics of the thoroughfare system and preservation of the residential
neighborhoods of the village are paramount.
Three (3) zoning districts are provided for commercial activity. Types of use permitted
or allowed as a special use, maximum floor area ratios, and building height regulations
apply in all commercial zoning districts. The three (3) zoning districts provide a broad
range of opportunity for the development and preservation of commercial activity
within the village.
B. General Standards: The following standards apply to all commercial zoning districts:

C. Description Of Districts:
1. C-1 General Commercial District: The C-1 general commercial district is intended to
provide for the full range retail activity and commercial activity serving the village.
This district promotes public convenience and business prosperity for the highest
intensity area of retail, commercial, financial, and service facilities, as further
promoted by the Waukegan Road and Dempster Street corridor master plans.
Facilities required to serve the needs of governmental, educational, and
recreational uses and those of a limited range of commercial uses with special
performance characteristics may be permitted within the district as special uses.
These are subject to the restrictions intended to preserve and protect their
compatibility with regularly permitted uses in the C-1 zoning district and uses in
adjacent zoning district.
2. C-2 Neighborhood Commercial District: The C-2 neighborhood commercial district
is intended to provide for groups of small business establishments located to serve
frequent retail and personal service needs of residents within convenient traveling
distance. It is not intended to permit major commercial or service establishments
which would attract substantial amounts of trade from outside the neighborhood.
Certain facilities required to serve governmental, educational, recreational and
other needs of the area may be permitted within the district as special uses. These
are subject to restriction intended to preserve and protect their compatibility with
regularly permitted uses in the C-2 zoning district and uses in adjoining zoning
districts.
3. C/R Commercial/Residential District: The intent of the C/R commercial/residential
zoning district is to provide a higher density of residential use than in the R-3
general residence district and associated neighborhood commercial uses which
service this higher density residential use. This district is also intended to create
development which is compact, and pedestrian oriented. These goals are also
promulgated in the Lehigh/Ferris subarea plan that encompasses a portion of the
C/R commercial/residential zoning district. (Ord. 08-19, 6-9-2008)

12-4-4: MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS:
A. Statement Of Purpose: The manufacturing district regulations are intended to govern
the location, intensity and method of development of the industrial areas of the village.
The regulations are designed to provide for the grouping together of uses that are
compatible to one another and that are not objectionable to the community as a whole.
The regulations preserve lands for industrial and other uses specifically provided for in
this section and prohibit the intrusion of certain incompatible uses into the industrial
area. The performance of the manufacturing district uses is regulated by establishing
standards for the external effects of noise, smoke, vibration, and other potential
nuisances.
Consistent with the purposes and intent of this title, all processes which negatively
affect other properties are prohibited. To better effect this intent, certain uses are
noted "MFPM" (made from purchased material) to stress that all uses involving raw
material refining are incompatible with the intent of this title.
B. General Standards: The following general provisions shall apply to all property within
the manufacturing districts:
1. Operations Within Closed Buildings: The operations and activities of all uses within
this district, excluding off street parking, shall be conducted within completely
enclosed structures.
2. Underground Utility Systems, Transformers And Metering Equipment: All on site
utility lines including power and telephone lines, but excluding high tension lines,
shall be located underground. All transformer and terminal equipment and
equipment for metering the usage of water, natural gas, electricity, etc., shall be
located underground or within buildings or shall be effectively screened from view
from streets and adjacent properties.
3. Lighting: All exterior lighting, parking lot lights, exterior building lights and
landscape lighting shall be directed away from adjoining highways, streets, and
properties. Parking areas and pedestrian walkways from the parking area to
building entrances shall have a minimum of one foot-candle of light on the surface
of such areas. Parking lot lighting may be extinguished one hour after the last
regular shift has ended for the evening. Lighting shall meet the lighting
requirements in chapter 10, "Utilities", of this title, which are available from the
public works department. Light pole and fixture design shall be in accordance with
the requirements set forth in chapter 12, "Design Standards", of this title.
4. Location Of Structure On Site: A structure used in the manufacturing, fabricating,
assembly, disassembly, repair, storage, or service of materials, products or goods,
or an antenna or antenna support structure, shall be located a minimum of fifty
feet (50') from all lot lines abutting a residential zoning district.
5. Specifically Excluded Uses: Only uses listed in this section as permitted uses or
special uses shall be allowed in the manufacturing districts. All other uses
including, but not limited to, the uses listed below are specifically excluded.
Manufacturing processes which are highly flammable, such as arsenals, fireworks
or explosive manufacture or storage, petroleum processing or refining, pyroxylin
manufacture.
Manufacturing processes which emanate noxious odors, such as crematories,
creosote treatment or manufacture, fertilizer manufacture, dumping, reduction or
other processing of garbage, ore reduction, natural or synthetic rubber, caoutchouc
or gutta percha manufacture, salt work, sauerkraut manufacture, soap
manufacture, tar distillation or manufacture, or cement concrete or asphaltic
concrete mixing plants.
Processing of animals such as abattoirs, offal or refuse, smelters, stockyards or
slaughter of animals or fowl, fat rendering, tallow, grease or lard manufacture or
treatment, tanning, curing or storage of rawhide or skins.
C. Description Of Districts:
1. M-O/R Office/Research Manufacturing District: The M-O/R District is intended to
control the development of land to be used by industrial firms that have high
standards of performance and that can locate in close proximity to residential and
business uses without creating nuisances and to provide land for development of
office and research uses along with non-impactful light industrial, technology
“start-up’s” and other similar, complementary uses and activities. The regulations
are designed to permit operations in a clean and quiet manner for office, research
and development (“R&D”), engineering and testing, non-impactful industrial and
technology, and similar uses that will not have an adverse effect upon the
environmental quality of the community. Some retail uses accessory and/or
complementary to the permitted office and research uses, but are not dependent
upon intensive off-site retail customers, may be permitted. Heavy Manufacturing
and similar uses that produce higher levels of noise, odor, vibration, etc. than
typically experienced with office and similar type uses are prohibited.
2. M-1 Restricted Manufacturing District: The M-1 restricted manufacturing district is
intended to control the development of land to be used by industrial firms that
have high standards of performance and that can locate in close proximity to
residential and business uses without creating nuisances. The district regulations
are designed to permit the operations of manufacturing, wholesaling, and service
activities with adequate protection to adjacent district uses and sufficient control of
external effects to protect one use from another. Some retail uses are permitted
that service the industrial uses within the industrial area or that do not depend
upon intensive visits of retail customers. This district is established in areas which
are the most sensitive in terms of impact on lower intensity uses surrounding
them.
3. M-2 General Manufacturing District: The M-2 general manufacturing district is
intended to provide land for development by most types of light industrial firms.
The regulations are designed to permit operations in a clean and quiet manner,
and to protect adjacent district uses and industries within the district. Development
of residences is prohibited in this district to minimize any adverse effects of the
manufacturing uses identified and to conserve the supply of industrial land for
industrial use.
D. Performance Standards: Businesses, utilities, light industry, research and related
activities shall be established and maintained with proper appearance as viewed from
public rights of way and adjoining properties. All uses shall control emission of noise,
odor, glare, light, vibration, visual emissions, gases, and wastes, per the standards set
forth below.
Building plans shall bear the signature of a qualified professional indicating compliance
with all performance standards. The village retains the option to conduct its own
investigation to determine proper compliance.
The following performance standards shall be adhered to:
1. Noise: Noise shall be measured on any property line of the tract on which the use is
located. Noise shall be muffled so as not to become objectionable due to
intermittence, beat frequency, shrillness, or intensity. At the property line the
sound pressure level of noise radiated continuously from a facility shall not exceed
the value given in table 1 of this section in any octave band frequency. The sound
pressure level shall be measured with a sound level meter and an octave band
analyzer that conform to specifications published by the American Standards
Association. Octave band analyzers shall be calibrated in the preferred frequencies
(American Standards Association SI.6-1984). Preferred frequencies for acoustical
measurements shall be used.

2. Odors: Odors from any use hereinafter begun shall not be discernible at the
property line and shall not exceed the odor threshold concentration. The
measurement of the threshold odor shall be in accordance with the American
Society for Testing and Materials Method D1391-57 "Standard Method For
Measurement Of Odor In Atmosphere (Dilution Method)" (Philadelphia: American
Society of Testing and Materials, 1978). Detailed plans for the prevention of odors
crossing property lines may be required before the issuance of a building permit.
3. Vibration: Vibration shall not be discernible at any property line to the human
sense of feeling for three (3) minutes or more duration in any one hour. Vibration
shall not produce an acceleration of more than 0.1 gravities or shall not result in
any combination of amplitudes and frequencies beyond the "safe" range as
designated in the American Standards Association, "Ruling On Blasting" (ANSI
Z9-4-1985) on any structure. The methods and equations of said ruling shall be
used to compute all values for the enforcement of this provision.
4. Visual Emissions And Gases: Solid or liquid particles shall not be emitted at any
point in concentrations exceeding those identified in the state of Illinois rules and
regulations, title 35, subtitle B, chapter I, subchapter C, parts 212, 214, 215, 216,
217, and 230.
These emissions shall occur from only one such emission source located within a
one thousand foot (1,000') radius from the center point of any other such emission
source owned or operated by such person or corporation, provided that such
opaque emissions shall be limited to three (3) times in one 24-hour period.
5. Waste: All sewage and industrial wastes shall be treated and disposed of in such
manner as to comply with the water quality standards applicable to the
classification assigned to the receiving waters by the village, the metropolitan
water reclamation district of greater Chicago (MWRDGC), the state of Illinois, and
the U.S. EPA. Approval by the MWRDGC or the Illinois EPA of all plans for waste
disposal facilities shall be required before issuance of any building permit.
6. Radiation Hazards: Materials that present potential radiation hazards shall be
stored and used only in conformance with the most restrictive of the applicable
state and federal regulations, as identified by the Illinois department of nuclear
safety or the U.S. nuclear regulatory commission.
7. Electromagnetic Interference: Electromagnetic interference shall not adversely
affect the operation of any equipment other than that belonging to the creator of
such interference, and must conform to the regulations of the federal
communications commission.
8. Fire And Explosion Hazards:
a. The storage, utilization, or manufacture of materials or products listed as use
group F or S in the village building code is permitted subject to compliance with
all other performance standards for the M districts. Use and storage of such
materials shall be in conformance with standards and requirements adopted by
titles 9 and 10 of this code.
b. The storage, utilization, or manufacture of materials or products listed as use
group H in the village building code is permitted subject to compliance with all
other performance standards for the M districts, standards and requirements
adopted by titles 9 and 10 of this code, and provided the following conditions
are met:
(1) All such outside storage or accessory structures which include aboveground
storage tanks and drum storage shall be set back at least thirty feet (30')
from lot lines and principal buildings.
(2) Outside drum storage tanks for flammable or combustible liquids are not to
exceed twenty (20) drums (1,100 gallons) of waste material awaiting pick
up.
(3) Use and storage of bulk liquefied or compressed nonflammable or oxidizing
gases shall be limited to five thousand (5,000) cubic feet.
(4) Hazardous materials and chemicals not listed above shall be stored and

base parking requirement of the uses as required collectively, or the base parking
requirement of the most parking intensive use, whichever is greater.
2. Of the total spaces provided, at least one reserved space per residential unit must
be provided.
3. Availability of off site public parking within 1/8 mile (660 ft.) of the proposed use
may be considered in determining the commercial parking requirement. (Ord.
07-07, 3-26-2007; Ord. 18-20, 12-11-18)
12-5-7: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR THE C/R

lot: Fifteen percent (15%) parking reduction.
b. More than 1/8 mile (660 feet) up to 1/4 mile (1,320 feet): Ten percent (10%)
parking reduction.
3. Fundamental Design Principals Of Developments In C/R District: This zoning district
is intended to encourage the creation of a vibrant mixed use neighborhood that
allows for convenient access to local businesses and the Metra station while giving
priority to pedestrians and residents. Developments within this district should be
designed to make a synergistic contribution to the district as a whole. The following
fundamental principals have been developed to better achieve this community
goal:
a. Create Appropriately Scaled Streetwall for Commercial Areas: The "streetwall"
is the vertical plane that defines the "wall" of the public space (street and
sidewalks). The streetwall is typically created by multiple adjacent buildings on
each block. Both sides of the street should be considered when establishing the
streetwall. To create a comfortable, human scale public space, the height of the
buildings should be greater than the width of the street, provided that such
building height is compatible with adjacent buildings.
b. Create Continuous Streetwall: The streetwall should be continuous to avoid
"empty" spaces. Accordingly, gaps between buildings should be less than the
width of the building. The public space of the street and sidewalk should be
formed by the buildings rather than be considered leftover space.
c. Parking Location: Surface parking should be located behind buildings to avoid
disrupting the pedestrian nature of the streetwall.
d. Visually Appealing Streetwall: The building design should be oriented to the
pedestrian nature of the district. This can be accomplished by articulating the
face of the building or incorporating architectural elements that are recessed
inward or projected outward from the primary face of the building. Landscaping
can also contribute to the streetwall. Long stretches of blank, windowless walls
at grade are to be avoided.
e. Anchor Corners: Developments which are constructed at intersections with two
(2) streets should anchor the corners of the buildings in close proximity to those
intersections. This is vital to creating the streetwall as it provides scale to the
intersection and reduces the amount of paving and empty space.
f. Establish Uniform Building Line For Streetwall: Buildings should be set back at
the appropriate distance to create a relatively continuous line to succeed in
creating the streetwall and an interesting, safe, pedestrian path along the
street. Each block and area of the C/R district will be unique in terms of the
appropriate setback to create the desired streetwall.
g. Focused Views: Site plans and building design should be arranged to create
focal points to guide travelers around corners and draw them farther down the
street.
h. Location Of Primary Entrances: The primary entrance to individual buildings
should be located on the primary rather than secondary street. Driveways and
services should be located on secondary streets or alleys to give priority to
pedestrians on the primary streets.
I. Contribution To An Interesting Pedestrian Zone: Developments in the C/R district
should provide a comfortable and safe route for pedestrians. Conflicts between
pedestrians and vehicles are to be avoided. Sidewalks adjacent to commercial
space should be wider than five feet (5') to allow for future streetscaping, public
art and outdoor seating. Buffers such as parkways with trees should separate
sidewalks from the street. On street parking can also serve as an effective
buffer at times.
j. Parking and Garage Placement. Surface parking lots shall not be located in front
of buildings facing a public street. Parking areas must be located to the side or
rear of buildings. Access to garages shall be from an alley private drive located
to the side or rear of a building. Garage access from Lincoln Avenue is
discouraged in the CR District. If structured parking is provided on the ground
floor of mixed-use and commercial buildings, parking shall be prohibited within
fifty feet (50’) of Lincoln Avenue to ensure adequate commercial space on
Lincoln Avenue.
k. Façade Transparency for Commercial and Mixed Uses: At least 50% of the wall
area that is between 2 and 12 feet above grade shall be occupied by windows

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
12-6-1: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
The approval of a planned unit development is intended to facilitate a development which is in
the public interest and can provide a public benefit that would not otherwise be permitted if
all regulation governing the land use and development of the site had to be met. In approving
a planned unit development, the village board of trustees may impose greater restrictions, or
allow modifications and exception from regulations so long as such requirements, allowances,
modifications and exceptions are consistent with and justified by the benefits accruing to the
village and the public interest generally as a result of the planned unit development. Planned
unit developments shall be allowed in all zoning districts. The intent of this section is to permit
flexibility and provide performance standards for planned unit developments which permit a
creative approach to the development of land which may not be possible if all the technical
requirements of the underlying zoning or subdivision regulations had to be met. A planned
unit development is a special use, therefore requiring that the development must meet the
standards of a special use, in addition to the following objectives. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-6-2: OBJECTIVES:
The following objectives shall be considered and may serve as a basis for approving a planned
unit development:
A. Allow flexibility in the development of land and in the design of structures thereon;
B. Facilitate more efficient arrangement of buildings, traffic and circulation systems, land
use, and utilities;
C. Provide for more usable and suitably located common open space and/or recreation
areas and to encourage the construction of appropriate aesthetic amenities which will
enhance the character of the site;
D. Preserve and enhance desirable site characteristics and natural features such as
natural topography, vegetation, and geological features, and the prevention of soil
erosion;
E. Promote a higher standard of site and building design which will ensure a quality of
construction commensurate with other developments within the village and is
compatible with the character of the surrounding area and adjoining properties;
F. Provide for a variety of housing types within the village;
G. Provide for the development and redevelopment of unique land areas and sites that
may not otherwise be possible under the strict application of village regulations and
standards governing said development;
H. Facilitate the implementation of the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan,
particularly in respect to areas designated for potential redevelopment;
I. Encourage the development of quality affordable residential housing units; and
J. Encourage energy efficiency and use of green building and site design techniques. (Ord.
07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-6-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
These provisions shall apply to all planned unit developments proposed:
A. Authorization: A planned unit development may be approved and granted by the
village board of trustees after proper application pursuant to forms and procedures
established by the building commissioner have been filed and processed, and after a
public hearing has been held in accordance to the procedures set forth in section
12-16-4, "Procedure For Plan Commission", of this title, and after a determination has
been made that the planned unit development is in the best interest of the village. The
plan commission may recommend and the village board of trustees may require any
reasonable conditions or design considerations as a condition for the approval of the
planned unit development.
B. Ownership: The entire planned unit development shall be held in single ownership; or if
there are two (2) or more owners, the application for said planned unit development
shall be jointly filed and executed by all such owners. The application for a planned
unit development shall contain a statement executed by all property owners as follows:
1. All applicants, their successors, grantees and assigns shall be bound by all
conditions and regulations which may be imposed upon the granting of all planned
unit development, and as they apply to each individual parcel;

and the village board of trustees may approve other such modifications and exceptions
and may impose additional restrictions and conditions from regulations governing
setback, height, off street parking and loading, screening, lighting, signage, and
subdivision design standards, density and floor area ratio. (Ord. 13-21, 11-25-13)
12-6-4: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
Modifications in conventional zoning and subdivision regulations are privileges and will be
considered by the village board of trustees only in direct response to the accrual of tangible
benefits from the planned unit development to the village or the neighborhood in which it
would be located. These benefits shall be in the form of exceptional amenities, outstanding
environmental, landscape, architectural or site design, or the conservation of special
manmade or natural features of the site. Each planned unit development should be presented
and judged by its own merits. In reviewing an application for a planned unit development, the
following standards shall be considered in a reasonable manner, with appropriate regard for
the restrictions and/or limitations which exist for the site.
A. Comprehensive Plan: The planned unit development shall be consistent with the
general policies of the village as may be expressed in the comprehensive plan.
B. Public Welfare: The planned unit development should be so located, designed,
operated and maintained in a manner that will not only protect, but promote the public
health, safety, and welfare of the village.
C. Impact On Adjoining Properties: The proposed planned unit development will not be
injurious to the use and enjoyment of adjoining property and that the exceptions to the
underlying district regulations are for the purpose of promoting development which is
beneficial to the residents or occupants of the surrounding properties with and
adjoining the proposed development.
D. Drives, Parking And Circulation: Principal vehicular access to the planned unit
development shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning
movements and minimum hazards to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Adequate
provision should be made to provide ingress and egress in a manner that minimizes
traffic congestion in the public streets.
E. Impact On Public Facilities: The planned unit development shall be so designed that
adequate utilities, road access, drainage, and other necessary facilities will be provided
to serve it, and not negatively impact the existing public infrastructure. Surface water
in all paved access areas shall be collected in a manner that will not obstruct the flow
of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
F. Adequate Buffering And Landscaping: Adequate fencing, screening, and landscaping
shall be provided to protect the enjoyment of surrounding properties, or provide for
public safety, or to screen parking areas or other visually incompatible uses. The
existing landscape should be preserved in its natural state, to the extent as
practicable, minimizing tree and soil removal, and any grade changes shall be in
keeping with the general appearance of the neighboring developed area.
G. Integrated Design: The planned unit development shall be laid out and developed as a
unit in accordance with an integrated overall design. This design shall provide for safe,
efficient, convenient and harmonious groupings of structures, uses, and facilities,
including common open space and storm water detention areas, and for appropriate
relationship of space between buildings and site. Any common open space shall be
integrated into the design in a manner which has a direct or visual relationship to the
main building(s) and not be of an isolated or leftover character.
H. Appearance: The design of all buildings, structures, and facilities on the site of the
planned unit development shall be subject to the approval of the appearance review
commission, and shall be of quality as good, if not better, than the surrounding
neighborhood. Higher or denser buildings shall be located in such a way as to dissipate
any adverse impact on adjoining lower buildings within the development or on
surrounding properties.
I. Relationship To Adjoining Land And Neighborhood: All planned unit developments shall
encourage designs that emphasize accessibility, open views and connections to the
larger community as a whole, discouraging new development which may divide
neighborhoods and restrict access to adjacent property. In order to achieve this
objective, the design of lots, streets, sidewalks, and accessways within the planned
unit development, the continuation of such existing or proposed features to adjoining
areas shall be encouraged. When a proposed planned unit development adjoins land
susceptible of being subdivided, resubdivided, or redeveloped, new streets, sidewalks,
and accessways may be carried to the boundaries of the proposed planned unit
development. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)

manufacturing zoning districts, may be occupied by permitted uses in the respective
zoning district, provided the use does not require more than one parking space for
each two hundred fifty (250) square feet gross floor area. A nonconforming structure or
use due only to parking, which exceeds the one space for each two hundred fifty (250)
gross square feet of floor area, or which wishes to expand their use, may request a
parking variation in accordance with subsection 12-7-3K, "Parking Variations", of this
chapter.
D. Change Of Intensity Of Use: When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or
premises shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking
and loading facilities, such additional parking and loading facilities as required shall be
provided.
E. Change Of Use: Whenever the existing use of a building, structure or premises shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use.
F. Access To Parking And Loading Facilities: All off street parking and off street loading
spaces shall open directly onto an aisle or driveway designed to provide safe access to
such facilities.
G. Use Of Parking And Loading Facilities: All off street parking and loading areas shall be
used only for the temporary storage of motor vehicles related to the premises. The
storage of merchandise, motor vehicles for sale, or the repair of vehicles shall be
prohibited in such areas. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
H. Location Of Parking And Loading Facilities: All parking and loading facilities required
shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use served. No portion of a vehicle
utilizing such parking spaces or loading facilities shall be permitted to extend beyond
the lot lines of such zoning lot.
1. Exception In Commercial Or Manufacturing Zoning Districts: Parking spaces
required in the commercial or manufacturing zoning districts may be located on a
zoning lot within a three hundred foot (300') distance from the main building public
entrance to the use served, but only if the zoning lot is owned by the same owners
as the use served, or meets the shared parking regulations outlined in this chapter,
as approved by the zoning board of appeals. Parking lots on residentially zoned
property within a three hundred foot (300') distance from the main building public
entrance to the use served that are not adjacent to the use served are considered
special uses which require approval from the plan commission and village board of
trustees.
2. Contiguous Commercial Uses; Shared Parking Lot: For contiguous commercial uses
within a block, a shared parking lot created through the use of joint access
easements and other agreements, may be considered a single zoning lot for the
purposes of off street parking only. Existing regulations regarding joint use of
parking spaces, and parking variation requirements would still apply.
3. Parking For Residential Dwelling Units: For residential dwelling units, the required
off street parking may be provided in a private garage, including a carport, or on all
weather hard surface such as concrete, asphalt, or paving bricks, which is used for
storing the private passenger vehicles of the person, family, or families resident
upon the premises and in which no business, service or industry connected directly
or indirectly with automotive vehicles is carried on. In no case will parking spaces
be rented to persons or businesses not resident on the premises if such spaces are
required to satisfy the parking requirements of this chapter. Parking of recreational
and commercial vehicles in residential districts shall be in accordance with section
12-3-3 of this title.
4. Size And Access Requirements Must Be Met: Parking spaces may be provided on
open lots or within a garage or other covered space, provided that all size and
access requirements are met. (Ord. 08-19, 6-9-2008)
I. Acceptable Parking And Loading Facilities: Off street parking and loading shall be
permitted only on spaces meeting all standards listed below. No parking shall be
permitted on landscaped areas.
J. Screening And Landscaping: Requirements for screening and landscaping of off street
parking and loading areas are established in chapter 11, "Landscaping And Trees", of
this title. These regulations are intended to diminish the impact of parking areas and
loading areas abutting less intensively developed or zoned properties.
Screening height standards established by chapter 11 of this title, are minimums when
applied to plant material and absolute with respect to fences.
K. Lighting: All lighting used to illuminate off street parking spaces and loading facilities
shall be oriented so that direct rays of light are not cast on adjacent properties and
shall be subject to prior approval by the building commissioner. A minimum intensity of
one foot-candle shall illuminate all off street parking area surfaces or loading area
surfaces, as measured from the property line, and meet the lighting requirements in
chapter 10, "Utilities", of this title, which are available from the public works
department. Light pole and fixture design shall be in accordance with the requirements
set forth in chapter 12, "Design Standards", of this title.
L. Excess Parking And Loading: Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the
provisions of off street parking and loading facilities in excess of the number required,
provided that there is adherence to all other regulations governing the location, design
and operations of such facilities. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-7-3: OFF STREET PARKING:
Off street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the provisions herein:
A. Computation Of Parking Spaces: When the calculation of the number of off street
parking spaces required by this chapter results in a fractional space, any fraction less
than ½ shall be disregarded, while a fraction ½ or greater shall be counted as 1
parking space.
B. Impact Study: For all uses which are classified as special uses, the petitioner, at his,
her, or its cost, shall provide a traffic and parking impact study completed by a traffic
engineer selected from a list of engineers maintained by the village or as approved by
the village engineer, which details the traffic impact and the amount of parking
necessary and its usage. For special uses, the proposed parking standards identified in
subsection I, "Required Spaces By Use", of this section, shall be advisory only. The final
parking required for each special use shall be decided by the village board based on
the submitted, independent traffic and parking study and any traffic and parking
recommendation or study prepared by the village staff or village consultants or any
pertinent village commission and the recommendation of the plan commission.
C. Collective Provisions Of Parking Spaces: Off street parking facilities for separate uses
may be provided collectively, if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than
the sum of the separate requirements for each such use and provided that all
regulations governing location of parking spaces, in relation to the use served, are
observed. Further, no parking space or portion thereof shall serve as the required
space for more than one use, unless otherwise specifically authorized in accordance
with this chapter.
D. Handicapped Parking Spaces Required: Handicapped parking shall be provided in
accordance with the requirements of the Illinois accessibility code. Each handicapped
parking space shall be included in the count of parking spaces provided. (Ord. 07-07,
3-26-2007)
E. Parking Lot Surfaces: All permanent parking lot surfaces and vehicular accesses to
them shall be of an all weather, hard surface pavement conforming to the pavement
design standards available at the village of Morton Grove public works department. The
location and route of access to a parking lot shall be clearly identified. Temporary
parking lot surfaces shall be as determined by the building commissioner. (Ord. 08-19,
6-9-2008)
F. Prohibition Against Motor Vehicle Repair Or Service: Repair or servicing of motor
vehicles shall not be permitted in parking lots, except on an emergency basis.
G. Prohibition Against Motor Vehicle Merchandise Sales: Sale of gasoline, oil and other
motor vehicle accessories shall be prohibited in parking lots not associated with a
motor vehicle service station.
H. Collective Parking Provisions for Shared Spaces: The required total number of off-street
parking spaces for two (2) or more commercial, office, residential, industrial or
institutional uses collectively providing parking spaces, shall meet the following
requirements.
1. The Village Administrator, at the recommendation of the Building Commissioner,
the Village Engineer and the Community and Economic Development Director, may
authorize a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces for two (2) or
more uses jointly providing off-street parking when their respective hours of peak
operation do not overlap. Shared parking shall be located on the same lot,
abutting, or adjacent lots, lots shall not be separated by an arterial or collector
street.
2. Shared parking shall meet the following conditions:
a. Computation. The number of shared spaces for two (2) or more distinguishable
land uses shall be determined by the following procedure:
i. Determine the minimum number of parking spaces required for each
separate use as identified in 12-7-3.I. of this ordinance.
ii. Calculate the minimum number of parking spaces needed to meet the
expected parking demand for each of the uses sharing the parking spaces
for each of the six (6) designated time periods in table in 12-7-3.H.3. by
multiplying the minimum number of spaces required in 12-7-3.I. for each
use by the percentage shown for that use for the time periods in Table
12-7-3.H.3.
iii. Calculate the minimum number of parking spaces needed to meet the
expected total parking demand for the shared parking facilities for each of
the six time periods identified in Table 12-7-3.H.3. by totaling the results for
all of the uses for the time periods as calculated in paragraph b.
iv. Select the time period with the highest total number of parking spaces
required for all of the uses sharing the parking and use that total as the
shared parking requirement for Collective Parking.
b. Other Uses. If one (1) or all of the land uses proposing to make use of the
shared parking facilities do not conform to the general land use classifications
in Table 12-7-3.H.3. Shared Parking Calculations, then the Building
Commissioner and/or his/her designee shall determine the most closely related
use listed in the table, and the appropriate shared parking requirement, if any,
for such uses.
3. Process. Property owner(s) seeking approval of Collective Parking for Shared
Spaces shall submit an application on a form approved by the Building
Commissioner at the time of a building permit. The application shall include a list of
each existing and/or proposed tenant; the type of use of each tenant as defined in
12-17-1.; the square footage of each tenant space; and the computation of number
of required shared spaces, as described in 12-7-3.H.2.a. above, using the
categories, percentages and timeframes listed in the table below:

K. Parking Variations:
1. Peak Demand: Variations with regards to a reduction in off street parking are
obtainable, based on the actual peak demand of a use or combination of uses as
demonstrated by an independent traffic study completed by a traffic engineer
selected from a list of engineers maintained by the village or as approved by the
village engineer. In addition to the standards identified in chapter 16 of this title,
relative to variations and special uses in general, the amount of available, properly
zoned on street parking, and the proximity to municipally owned lots will be taken
into consideration regarding a parking variation. Parking variations may be
granted, based on the percentages below, by the zoning board of appeals, based
on the gross square footage of building size. Any requests for a higher percentage
than listed below will be considered a special use and require plan commission
recommendation and board of trustees approval.
Less than 10,000 square feet 35 percent
10,000 to 50,000 square feet 30 percent
50,000 to 100,000 square feet 20 percent
Over 100,000 square feet 15 percent
2. Dual Use Of Parking Spaces: The zoning board of appeals may authorize a variation
in the location of off street parking and reduction in the number of required parking
spaces for multiple use developments or for uses that are located near one another
and which have different peak parking demands and operating hours. Shared
parking shall be subject to the following standards:
a. Location: All uses that participate in a single shared parking plan shall be
located on the same lot or on lots that share a common boundary or are within
three hundred feet (300') of the public entrance of the uses served. The shared
parking lot shall be developed and used as though the uses on the lots were a
single unit.
b. Shared Parking Study: A shared parking study completed by an independent
traffic engineer, shall be submitted, which clearly establishes that uses will
make use of the shared spaces at different times of the day, week, month or
year. The study shall:
(1) Be based on the Urban Land Institute and Portland, Oregon, Metro's shared
parking study methodology or other generally accepted methodology;
(2) Address the size and type of activities, the composition of tenants, the rate
of turnover for proposed shared spaces and the anticipated peak parking
and traffic loads;
(3) Provide for a reduction by not more than the percentages of reduced parking
by total building square footage of the uses involved as indicated in
subsection K1 of this section, of the combined parking required for each
use;
(4) Provide for no reduction in the number of spaces reserved for persons with
disabilities;
(5) Be reviewed by the building commissioner or his designee, village engineer
and if deemed necessary, the traffic safety commission, and approved by
the zoning board of appeals.
c. Agreement For Shared Parking Plan: A shared parking plan shall be enforced
through written agreement, acceptable in form and substance to the
corporation counsel, between the owners of record. The shared parking
agreement shall be recorded, at the property owners' sole cost and expense,
against all properties subject to the agreement. In no event shall the village
issue any certificate of occupancy for any property subject to a shared parking
plan and agreement unless and until a fully executed copy of the agreement is
recorded in the office of the Cook County recorder. The agreement shall:
(1) List the names and ownership interest of all parties to the agreement and
contain the signatures of those parties;
(2) Provide a legal description of the land;
(3) Include a site plan showing the area of the parking areas;
(4) Describe the area of the parking parcel(s) and designate and reserve it for
shared parking unencumbered by any conditions which would interfere with
its use;
(5) Agree and expressly declare the intent for the covenant to run with the land
and bind all parties and all successors in interest to the covenant;
(6) Assure the continued availability of the spaces for joint use and provide
assurance that all spaces will be usable without charge to all participating
uses;
(7) Describe the obligations of each party, including the maintenance
responsibilities of each party;
(8) Incorporate the shared parking study by reference; and
(9) Describe the method by which the covenant shall, if necessary, be revised.
d. Change In Use: Should any of the shared parking uses be changed, or should
the village find that any of the conditions described in the approved shared
parking study or agreement no longer exist, the property owners shall have the
option of submitting a revised shared parking study and an amended shared
parking agreement in accordance with the standards of this subsection or of
providing the number of spaces required for each use as if computed
separately. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)

to protect property owners, residents and tenants against improper development as it
relates to appearance; to encourage and promote attractiveness, cohesiveness and
compatibility of buildings and sites in order to achieve harmonious appearance and
function; to provide open areas and parking areas which are aesthetically designed
and landscaped; to identify and preserve significant natural features, all of which will
serve to guide the future development of our village in a manner that will protect our
natural resources and facilitate the integration of development projects into our
existing environment. These regulations are intended to protect the high quality of life
existing within the village, protect property values, and promote the public health,
safety, and welfare of residents, tenants and owners of buildings and sites.
B. Applicability Of Regulations: The regulations herein apply to all properties designated
below:
1. Multiple dwelling developments in excess of two (2) units.
2. Business and commercial unit developments.
3. Industrial units and developments.
4. All planned unit developments and special uses.
5. All common, single-family subdivision developments, including streets, rights of
way, public areas and other general development features and models to be
offered for sale.
6. Municipal and other public facilities and lands.
7. One- and two-family residential dwellings, not in a subdivision but which require a
building permit for exterior modification, are exempt from the regulations in this
chapter, but are required to complete a design workbook which demonstrates how
the project is compatible with the existing neighborhood. Any project which is
deemed not to be compatible by the building commissioner and/or his designee
shall be sent to the appearance review commission for review.
C. Review Required: All site, landscape and building plans are to be reviewed by the
appearance review commission, and an appearance certificate by the commission
granted, prior to the issuance of a building permit.
D. Criteria And Evaluation Elements: The following factors and characteristics relating to a
unit or development and which affect appearance, will govern the appearance review
commission's evaluation of a design submission:
1. Evaluation Standards:
a. Property Values: Where a substantial likelihood exists that a building will
depreciate property values of adjacent properties or throughout the
community, construction of that building should be barred.
b. Inappropriateness: A building that is obviously incongruous with its
surroundings or unsightly and grotesque can be inappropriate in light of the
comprehensive plan goal of preserving the character of the municipality.
c. Similarity/Dissimilarity: A builder should avoid excessively similar or excessively
dissimilar adjacent buildings.
d. Safety: A building whose design or color might, because of the building's
location, be distracting to vehicular traffic may be deemed a safety hazard.
2. Design Criteria:
a. Standards: Appearance standards as set forth in this chapter.
b. Logic Of Design: Generally accepted principles, parameters and criteria of
validity in the solution of design problems.
c. Architectural Character: The composite or aggregate of the components of
structure, form, materials and functions of a building or group of buildings and
other architectural and site composing elements.
d. Attractiveness: The relationship of compositional qualities of commonly
accepted design parameters such as scale, mass, volume, texture, color and
line, which are pleasing and interesting to the reasonable observer.
e. Compatibility: The characteristics of different uses of activities that permit them
to be located near each other in harmony and without conflict. Some elements
affecting compatibility include intensity of occupancy as measured by dwelling
units per acre; floor area ratio; pedestrian or vehicular traffic generated;
parking required; volume of goods handled; and such environmental effects as
noise, vibration, glare, air pollution, erosion, or radiation.
f. Harmony: A quality which produces an aesthetically pleasing whole as in an
arrangement of varied architectural and landscape elements.
g. Material Selection: Material selection as it relates to the evaluation standards
and ease and feasibility of future maintenance.
h. Landscaping: All requirements set forth in chapter 11, "Landscaping And Trees",
of this title. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)

stormwater runoff and floodwaters flow either regularly or intermittently. (Ord. 08-28,
8-11-2008)
12-14-4: MAPS AND PROFILES:
A. Village Maps: Official maps which depict the floodplains, floodways and floodway
fringes, and floodway encroachment lines are available for inspection in the public
works department, are identified as parts of this chapter, are incorporated herein and
are identified as follows:
1. National flood insurance program flood boundary and floodway map number
17031C, panels 0237, 0241, 0242, 0243, and 0244, all dated August 19, 2008.
B. Flood Profiles: Flood profiles describing the expected elevation of floods along the
centerline of the principal watercourses of this village are available for inspection in
the public works department, are identified as parts of this chapter, are incorporated
herein and are identified as follows:
1. Flood insurance study for Cook County, dated August 19, 2008.
C. Conflicts Between Maps And Profiles: In the event a conflict arises between the
information depicted by the official village floodplain maps and the official village
profiles, and in the absence of any overriding information to the contrary, the data
prescribed by the profiles will govern.
D. Maps And Profiles:
1. Source Documents: Same as subsections A and B of this section.
2. Base Flood: Information pertaining to the base flood incorporated in this chapter,
including maps and profiles, has been extracted from and is based on the studies
and reports prepared by the federal emergency management agency, identified as
flood insurance study for Cook County, dated August 19, 2008.
E. Official Elevations: The system of official bench marks and elevations already
established in the area by the U.S. geological survey shall hereafter be taken by
engineers, surveyors, architects, and contractors when making topographical surveys
and maps, and when setting grades and elevations of buildings, pavements, drainage
facilities and other structures or works publicly constructed or regulated by the village.
F. Determination Of Base Flood Area Location And Elevations: The official maps described
in this section shall be used as an aid in determining whether a parcel of land lies
within the base flood area. The final decision, however, shall be based on the relation
of the surveyed ground elevation applicable to a specific parcel of land, if not otherwise
depicted by the official maps and profiles described above, shall be that elevation
established for the adjoining stream or channel. In riverine situations where a bend in
the stream exists and more than one line can be placed at right angles to the parcel of
land, the highest base flood elevation determined shall prevail.
G. How To Locate Designated Floodway Boundary: To locate the designated floodway
boundary on any site, the designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the
designated floodway map and located on a site plan, using marks common to both
maps. (Ord. 08-28, 8-11-2008)
12-14-5: VARIANCES:
No variances shall be granted to any development located in a "designated floodway" as
defined in section 12-14-3 of this chapter. However, when a development proposal is located
outside of a designated floodway, and whenever the standards of this chapter place undue
hardship on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the zoning board of
appeals for a variance.
A. No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that:
1. The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA;
2. An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not granted;
3. The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
4. There will be no additional threat to public health, safety, beneficial stream uses
and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation of a nuisance;
5. There will be no additional public expense for flood protection, lost environmental
stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to
streambeds and banks, roads, utilities, or other public facilities;
6. The provisions of subsections 12-14-7E and 12-14-8D of this chapter shall still be
met;
7. The activity is not in a designated floodway;
8. The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a general problem;
and
9. The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the area
involved including existing stream uses.
B. The zoning board of appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the
requirements of section 12-14-9 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of
protection to a building will:
1. Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as
twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance
coverage:
2. Increase the risks to life and property; and
3. Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that he will
acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability.
C. Variance requested in connection with restoration of site or building listed on the
National Register of Historical Places or documented as worthy of preservation by the
Illinois historic preservation agency may be granted using criteria more permissive
than the requirements of subsections 12-14-10A and B of this chapter. (Ord. 08-28,
8-11-2008)
12-14-6: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study and regulatory map
profiles for the village. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not
available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best
existing data available in the Illinois state water survey's floodplain information repository.
When a party disagrees with the best available data, he/she may finance the detailed
engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/DWR
and FEMA.
A. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of the north branch
of the Chicago River shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the
countywide flood insurance study for Cook County prepared by the federal emergency
management agency and dated August 19, 2008, including amendments to such study
and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
B. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs
delineated as an "A zone" on the flood insurance rate map of the village shall be
according to the best existing data available in the Illinois state water survey floodplain
information repository. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be
determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such
as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a
hydrologic model, such as HEC-1, TR-20 or HIP, or by techniques presented in various
publications prepared by the United States geological survey for estimating peak flood
discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in
the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans. Along
any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall be
submitted to IDNR/DWR for approval. Once approved it must be submitted to the
Illinois state water survey floodplain information repository for filing. For a nonriverine
SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet (3'),
unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the Illinois state
water survey. (Ord. 08-28, 8-11-2008)
12-14-7: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided
against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory
storage and other provisions of this chapter are met. No use will be permitted which adversely
affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood
fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of section
12-14-9 of this chapter.
A. Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not
exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first
obtaining a development permit from the building commissioner.
B. Application: Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by
the building commissioner. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the
site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the
property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade
elevations in MSL (1929 adjustment) datum or NGVD and all changes in grade resulting
from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including
basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the
development will be subject to the requirements of section 12-14-9 of this chapter.
C. Elevation Comparison: Upon receipt of a development permit application, the building
commissioner shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have
been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map
identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. The building commissioner shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification.
D. Other Documents: The building commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant, copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit
not required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The building
commissioner shall not issue a permit unless all other local, state and federal permits
have been obtained.
E. Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall create a
threat to public health and safety.
F. Site Elevation; LOMR: If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and
obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site
from the floodplain.
G. Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and
balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be equal
to 1.1 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
H. Fill Or Structure: In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be
made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost
below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-
year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. (Ord.
08-28, 8-11-2008)
12-14-8: OCCUPATION AND USE OF IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS:
This section applies to proposed development, redevhelopment, site modification or building
modification within a designated floodway. The designated floodway for the north branch of
the Chicago River shall be delineated on the regulatory floodway maps designated by
IDNR/DWR accordingly and referenced in section 12-14-4 of this chapter. Only those uses and
structures will be permitted which meet the criteria in this section. All floodway modifications
shall be the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the project. The development
shall also meet the requirements of section 12-14-9 of this chapter.

15. If the designated floodway delineation, base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation will change due to the proposed project, the application will not be
considered complete until IDNR/DWR has indicated conditional approval of the
regulatory floodway map change. No structures may be built until a letter of map
revision has been approved by FEMA.
16. The application for a structure shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn
to scale, showing property line dimensions and existing ground elevations and all
changes in grade resulting from any proposed excavation or filling, and floodplain
and floodway limits; sealed by a registered professional engineer, licensed

and additions to buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor (including
basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section 12-14-9
of this chapter.
C. Other Documents: The building commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits and approvals that
may be required for this type of activity. The building commissioner shall not issue the
development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained.
A professional engineer under the employ or contract of the village shall review and
approve applications reviewed under this section.
D. Preventing Increased Damages; List Of Appropriate Uses: The only development in a
floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses which will not cause a rise in the
base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety. Only
those appropriate uses listed in 92 Illinois administrative code 708 will be allowed.
Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures,
fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined
above as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase the building's
footprint and are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
building;
Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any
modification thereto;
Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope
toward a watercourse;
Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures without
toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway
storage;
Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements
relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish
and wildlife;
Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the
construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of
floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the
outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior
wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements
to the structure;
In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a
building that are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
building before it was damaged or replaced, and which do not increase the outside
dimensions of the building;
Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth of flooding at the 100-year
frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot) and aircraft parking aprons built at or
below ground elevation;
Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related
fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to
the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions;
Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or
shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements
related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water
dependent uses;
Underground and overhead utilities.
E. Engineering Criteria: Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the designated
floodway maps designated by IDNR/DWR, the construction of an appropriate use, will
be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following
engineering criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and
data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the
protection requirements of section 12-14-9 of this chapter.
1. Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages Upstream:
For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on stream structures or
dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be
replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In
calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall
be taken into consideration:
a. Designated floodway conveyance,
"K" = 1.486 AR2/3
n
where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See "Open
Channel Hydraulics", Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New
York.)
b. The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed
conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or
local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained
or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover.
c. Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective
designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction
ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/DWR
through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transition
may be used with the same efficiency.
(1) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water
should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
(2) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water
should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
(3) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of
one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length shall
be used.
(4) Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid
expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
(5) All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to
flood flows.
2. Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream Flooding:
Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost
due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the
impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or
structures shall be equal to at least 1.1 times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall
not be required to be replaced. The compensatory designated floodway storage
shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed
100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing
10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If
the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/DWR through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no
reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless
such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at the existing structure.
3. Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream Erosion Or Flood
Heights: For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream
structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel
or designated floodway velocities. However, in the case of bridges or culverts or on
stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during
normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour,
erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design
measures.
4. Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway Approaches: The
proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater
than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to
and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases
will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of
the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or
flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will
increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact
IDNR/DWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver.
a. The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the
flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for
the flood study specified in section 12-14-6 of this chapter. Culverts must be
analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA hydraulic chart for the selection of highway
culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/federal highway
administration hydraulics of bridge waterways calculation procedures.
b. Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection E2 of this
section.
c. Velocity increases must be compensated for per subsection E3 of this section.
d. If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or
commercial navigation, a department of transportation permit must be
received.
e. All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per
subsection E8 of this section.
f. The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the
existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to
IDNR/DWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required per this subsection
and subsection D of this section.
5. Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts, And Approach Roads:
a. The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification
shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the
existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year
event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage.
b. If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood
damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's
engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the
existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on
upstream and downstream properties.
c. The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood
damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with the
department of transportation rules 92 Illinois administrative code 708 (floodway
construction in northeastern Illinois) and submitted to the division of water
resources for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.
6. On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water: Any increase in
upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the existing
conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event
shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions
of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees
or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a
permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/DWR, dam safety section for a
dam safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment
structures as defined in section 12-14-3 of this chapter shall meet the permitting
requirements of 92 Illinois administrative code 702 (construction and maintenance
of dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or
floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
a. The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood
control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
b. The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
c. The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or
habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a presedimentation basin;
d. A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream
watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the
input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more
than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the
impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to
ensure comprehensive watershed control;
e. The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
7. Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial Structures: If
construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the
outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no farther than
ten feet (10') from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and
conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities.
8. Excavation In The Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges
and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The
following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's
engineer can prove to IDNR/DWR through engineering calculations or model tests
that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
a. When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water
should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal
for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
b. When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should
be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for
every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length; and
c. When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one
foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length shall be
used.
d. Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of
the transition sections.
9. Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding
and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
10. Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects, the permitting
requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can
demonstrate to IDNR/DWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the
proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood
heights outside the project right of way or easements for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event.
11. General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
a. The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study,
referenced in section 12-14-6 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the
base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have
changed, IDNR/DWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the
appropriate base conditions data to use.
b. If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed
construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with
a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the
requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the
designated floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at
normal water elevations.
c. If the applicant learns from IDNR/DWR, local governments, or a private owner
that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed,
reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be
built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five (5) years, the
proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements
of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile
conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built.
12. Conditional Letter Of Map Revision: If the appropriate use would result in a change
in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/DWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations
and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map
revision and receive from IDNR/DWR a conditional approval of the regulatory
floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final designated floodway
map will not be changed by IDNR/DWR until as built plans or record drawings are
submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/DWR. In the case of nongovernment
projects, the municipality in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed
conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/DWR approval can be
given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional
approval is issued. No further development activities shall take place until a final
letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA and IDNR/DWR.
13. Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall be performed by
or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer.
14. Construction Activities In Floodway: For all activities in the floodway involving
construction within twenty five feet (25') of the channel, the following criteria shall
be met:
a. A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty five
feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
b. Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an
appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion
of construction.
c. The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access
through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for stream
maintenance purposes.
d. After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and
issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as
necessary to change the designated floodway designation may proceed but no
buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may
be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway designated floodway map is
changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway
designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by
IDNR/DWR and FEMA of the "as built" plans.
F. State Review: For those projects listed in this subsection, located in a designated
floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/DWR for their review and
concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
1. IDNR/DWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed
bridge pursuant to subsection E4 of this section.
2. IDNR/DWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or
culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection E5 of this section.
3. IDNR/DWR will review alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
storage pursuant to subsections E1, E2 and E8 of this section.
4. IDNR/DWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction any
department projects, dams (as defined in section 12-14-3 of this chapter) and all
other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the
municipality or county.
G. Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a development
permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first
obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from
IDNR/DWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq. No permit
from IDNR/DWR shall be required if the division has delegated this responsibility to the
village.
H. Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a
"dam" as defined in section 12-14-3 of this chapter per 92 Illinois administrative code
702 (rules for construction of dams) shall obtain an Illinois division of water resources
dam safety permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the village engineer
finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/DWR permit, the village engineer shall
immediately notify the dam safety section of the division of water resources. If the
village engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the village
engineer shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, IDNR/DWR, dam safety section
in Springfield and the Illinois emergency services and disaster agency (ESDA).
I. Activities That Do Not Require A Registered Professional Engineer's Review: The
following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's
review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this chapter, including
the mitigation requirements.
1. Underground and overhead utilities that:
a. Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations, or
b. Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the designated
floodway, or

sewer lines and on site waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all
manholes or other aboveground openings located below the FPE are watertight.
D. Carrying Capacity And Notification: For all projects involving channel modification, fill,
or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the village shall notify adjacent
communities in writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the
alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
E. Protecting Buildings: All buildings located within a 100-year floodplain, also known as
SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation.
However, existing buildings located within a designated floodway shall also meet the
more restrictive appropriate use standards included in section 12-14-8 of this chapter.
This building protection criteria applies to the following situations:
1. Construction or placement of a new building;
2. Nonconforming structures may remain in use, but shall not be enlarged, replaced
or structurally altered. A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or
other manmade or natural disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds
fifty percent (50%) of its market value. In which case, it must, thereafter, conform
to this chapter;
3. Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an
existing site. This building protection requirement does not apply to returning a
mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid
flood damage; and
4. Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
F. Building Protection Requirements: A residential or nonresidential building, when
allowed, may be constructed on permanent landfill in accordance with the following:
1. The lowest floor (including basement) shall be so sited on fill or be otherwise
designed and constructed so as to include a freeboard of at least one foot (1')
between the lowest floor and the base flood elevation.
2. The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot (1') deep before
compaction and should extend at least ten feet (10') beyond the foundation of the
building before sloping below the flood protection elevation. The top of the fill shall
be above the flood protection elevation. However, the ten foot (10') minimum may
be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the
building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected
against erosion and scour. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface
drainage from or onto neighboring properties.
G. Elevation: A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in accordance with
the following:
1. The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space, stilts, piles, walls,
or other foundation that is permanently open to floodwaters and not subject to
damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood.
The permanent openings shall be no more than one foot (1') above grade, and
consists of a minimum of two (2) openings. The openings must have a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding below the base flood elevation.
2. The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation
to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known
hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice and floating debris.
3. All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed of materials
resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement) and all electrical,
heating, ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and utility meters
shall be located at or above the flood protection elevation. Water and sewer pipes,
electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other waterproofed service
facilities may be located below the flood protection elevation.
4. No area below the flood protection elevation shall be used for storage of items or
materials.
5. When the building wall encloses open space that is below the base flood elevation,
gravity storm and sanitary sewer connections are specifically prohibited and
overhead sewers are required for the sanitary connections and sumps for the
storm sewer connections.
6. Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days shall be elevated to or above the flood protection
elevation; and, shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement
by being tied down in accordance with the rules and regulations for the Illinois
mobile home tie down act issued pursuant to 77 Illinois administrative code 870.
H. Floodproofing: Only a nonresidential building may be structurally floodproofed (in lieu
of elevation) provided that a registered professional engineer shall certify that the
building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation,
the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design shall take
into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing
measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source
of electricity (levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered
floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection).
I. Nonconforming Structures: Nonconforming structures located in a designated floodway
may remain in use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered. A
nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or manmade
disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its market
value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this chapter. (Ord.
08-28, 8-11-2008)
12-14-10: SUBDIVISION, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT
REGULATIONS:
The plan commission and the board of trustees shall take into account flood hazards, to the
extent that they are known, in all official actions related to land management, use and
development.
A. New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements, and planned
unit developments (PUDs) within the SFHA shall be reviewed to assure that the
proposed developments are consistent with sections 12-14-7, 12-14-8, and 12-14-9 of
this chapter and the need to minimize flood damage. Plats or plans for new
subdivisions, mobile home parks and planned unit developments (PUDs) shall include a
signed statement by a registered professional engineer that the plat or plans account
for changes in the drainage of surface waters in accordance with the plat act3.
B. Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, travel trailer parks, planned
unit developments (PUDs) and additions to manufactured home parks and additions to
subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation data and
floodway delineations.
C. Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in
such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and channels. Wherever
possible, the floodplains shall be included within parks or other public grounds.
D. The plan commission and the board of trustees shall not approve any planned unit
development (PUD) or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits unless
such agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord.
08-28, 8-11-2008)
12-14-11: ADMINISTRATION:
The building commissioner and the village engineer shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the
duties listed in this section.
A. To fulfill those duties, the building commissioner first should use the criteria listed in
section 12-14-6, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter, to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site
is located within a floodplain, the village engineer must determine whether the
development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within an SFHA or
floodplain on which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe,
the village engineer shall ensure that the minimum requirements of section 12-14-7 of
this chapter are met. If the site is within the floodway, the village engineer shall ensure
that the minimum requirements of section 12-14-8 of this chapter are met.
In addition, the general requirements of section 12-14-9 of this chapter shall be met for
all developments meeting the requirements of sections 12-14-7 and 12-14-8 of this
chapter. The building commissioner shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall
meet the requirements of section 12-14-9 of this chapter.
If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the building commissioner and the village
engineer shall review the requirements of section 12-14-5 of this chapter to make sure
they are met. In addition, the building commissioner shall complete all notification
requirements.
In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this chapter, the
building commissioner may take any and all actions as outlined in section 12-14-16 of
this chapter.
B. The building commissioner shall be responsible for the general administration and
enforcement of this chapter which shall include the following:
1. Determining The Floodplain Designation: Check all new development sites to
determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA). If they are in an
SFHA, the village engineer shall determine whether they are in a floodway or in a
flood fringe.
2. Professional Engineer Review: If the development site is within a floodway the
permit shall be referred to a professional engineer (PE) under the employ or
contract of the village for review to ensure that the development meets the
requirement of section 12-14-8 of this chapter. In the case of an appropriate use,
the PE shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of
section 12-14-8 of this chapter.
3. Dam Safety Requirements: Ensure that an IDNR/DWR dam safety permit has been
issued or a letter indicating no dam safety permit is required, if the proposed
development activity includes construction of a "dam" as defined in section
12-14-3 of this chapter. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or
impoundment structures.
4. Other Permit Requirements: Ensure that any and all required federal, state and
local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit.
5. Plan Review And Permit Issuance: Ensure that all development activities within the
SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of this chapter and
issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter and other regulations of this community when the development meets the
conditions of this chapter.
6. Inspection Review: The village engineer shall inspect all development projects
before, during and after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure
and to ensure they comply with the provisions of this chapter.
7. Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain in the permit files an elevation
certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a
residential or nonresidential building or the elevation to which a nonresidential
building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings
subject to section 12-14-9 of this chapter for public inspection and provide copies
of same.
8. Records Of Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon
request base flood data, SHFA and designated floodway maps, copies of federal or
state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional letter of map
revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as built" elevation
and floodproofing or elevation and floodproofing certificates for all buildings
constructed subject to this chapter.
9. State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by the
Illinois division of water resources, for all development projects subject to section
12-14-8 of this chapter, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to
the village. Upon acceptance of this chapter by IDNR/DWR and FEMA, responsibility
is hereby delegated to the village as per 92 Illinois administrative code 708 for
construction in the regulatory floodway and floodplain when floodways have not
been defined in sections 12-14-8 and 12-14-9 of this chapter. However, the
following review approvals are not delegated to the village and shall require review
or permits from IDNR/DWR:
a. Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per the Illinois Compiled
Statutes;
b. Department of transportation projects, dams or impoundment structures as
defined in section 12-14-3 of this chapter and all other state, federal or local
unit of government projects, including projects of the village and county, except
for those projects meeting the requirements of subsection 12-14-8I of this
chapter;
c. An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a
source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile,
per subsection 12-14-8E3 of this chapter;
d. An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to subsection 12-14-8E4 of this
chapter;
e. Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent compensatory
storage as indicated in subsections 12-14-8E1, E2 and E8 of this chapter;
f. Permit issuance of structures within or over publicly navigable rivers, lakes and
streams;
g. Any changes in the base flood elevation or floodway locations; and
h. Base flood elevation determinations where none now exist.
10. Cooperation With Other Agencies: Cooperate with state and federal floodplain
management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and
designated floodway data and to improve the administration of this chapter.
Submit data to IDNR/DWR and the federal emergency management agency for
proposed revisions of a regulatory map. Submit reports as required for the national
flood insurance program. Notify the federal emergency management agency of any
proposed amendments to this chapter.
11. Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to
administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject however to the
review and approval of IDNR/DWR and FEMA for any chapter changes. (Ord. 08-28,
8-11-2008)
12-14-12: APPEALS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS:
Appeals of the decisions of any administrative body of the village in the interpretation of this
chapter may be made to the village board by any aggrieved person or governmental unit
within thirty (30) days of such decision of approval or rejection. Grounds for approval or
rejection of all such appeals shall be stated in writing. (Ord. 08-28, 8-11-2008)
12-14-13: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the
SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part
of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully hereunder. (Ord. 08-28,
8-11-2008)
12-14-14: SEPARABILITY:
The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and the invalidity of
any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the remainder. (Ord. 08-28,
8-11-2008)
12-14-15: JUDICIAL REVIEW:
All final actions of the zoning board of appeals and the village board of trustees shall be
reviewed in compliance with the administrative review act of 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes,
and the provisions of the administrative review act are hereby adopted for the purpose of
such judicial review. (Ord. 08-28, 8-11-2008)
12-14-16: PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION:
Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance resolution shall
be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the building
commissioner may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exist.
The building commissioner shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
A. If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the violation:
1. The village may make application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring
conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the court deems
necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
2. Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in
accordance with title 1, chapter 4 of this code for each offense.
3. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which
a violation occurs or continues.
4. The village may record a notice of violation on the title to the property.
B. The building commissioner shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered
a wilful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a
standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
C. Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful action to prevent
or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or
persons responsible. (Ord. 09-16, 10-12-2009)

NONCONFORMITIES
12-15-1: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the intent of this chapter to provide for the continuation and, under appropriate
circumstances, elimination of nonconformities to the requirements of this title or
nonconformities to future amendments of this title.
Nonconformity is any characteristic of a structure or lot or parcel of land, the use of which was
lawful prior to the date of enactment of this title or any subsequent amendment but that does
not currently conform to the requirements of this title.
The lawful issuance of a building permit prior to the dates of this title shall be considered to
establish the lawful nonconforming status of any building or structure provided that the work
authorized under the building permit is lawfully performed.
The provisions herein are designed to accomplish the intent of this chapter in a way that:
A. Recognizes the rights and interests of owners of individual properties that have been
rendered nonconforming by village action to upgrade zoning policies and standards;
B. Permits certain nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival;
C. Minimizes the nuisance, reduction in neighboring property values, and other adverse
effects of properties that do not conform to their environs. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-15-2: NONCONFORMING USES:
Nonconforming uses are any activities or functions carried on at premises (as either a
principal or accessory use) that are not allowed by the permitted and special uses of the
zoning district in which the premises is situated. Nonconforming use shall not be:
A. Expanded or extended into any other portion of the land or structure in which it is
located and is not occupied by the nonconforming use on the date of adoption of this
title or by any amendments to this title.
B. Changed to another nonconforming use.
C. Structurally altered, with the exception of ordinary repairs including facade treatments
and those required by law, as determined by the building commissioner.
D. Restored or reconstructed if damaged or destroyed if the cost of reconstruction or
restoration will exceed fifty percent (50%) of the then current replacement cost of the
entire structure.
E. Continued if damaged or destroyed and if reconstruction or restoration which is less
than fifty percent (50%) of the current replacement cost of the entire structure is not
initiated within one year from the date of damage or destruction and diligently pursued
to completion.
F. Continued if the use has been discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive months
other than property being restored in accordance with subsection E of this section. All
subsequent uses of the land and/or structure shall conform to the use regulations of
the zoning district in which the structure is located. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-15-3: NONCONFORMING USE DUE TO PARKING:
Structures which are nonconforming due only to insufficient off street parking in the
commercial or manufacturing zoning districts may be occupied by permitted uses in the
respective zoning district, provided the use does not require more than one parking space for
each two hundred fifty (250) square feet gross floor area. A nonconforming structure or use
due only to parking, which exceeds the one space for each two hundred fifty (250) gross
square feet of floor area, or which wishes to expand their use, may request a parking variation
in accordance with subsection 12-7-3K, "Parking Variations", of this title. (Ord. 07-07,
3-26-2007)
12-15-4: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
These provisions shall apply to structures which are occupied by permitted uses or allowable
special uses in the zoning district in which they are located, but do not conform to the
setback, height, or floor area ratio requirements of the district in which they are located.
These provisions also apply to residential structures which were constructed on lots which
became nonconforming due to lot width and size, except as noted in Section 12-15-4:A.1.,
below. These provisions refer to structural nonconformities due to zoning provisions.
Structural nonconformities due to building and fire codes must still comply with the provisions
regarding nonconformities in those codes specifically.
A. Continuation And Expansion Of Nonconforming Structures: Nonconforming structures
may continue and may be expanded and altered as follows:
1. Administrative Review: Nonconforming structures may be expanded and altered,
through an administrative review process, provided that the proposed addition to
and/or alteration of the structure meets the following criteria:
a. The existing lot area and lot width comply with the requirements established in
Unified Development Code for the specific zoning district in which the property
is located;
b. The addition to or alternation of the structure does not expand or increase the
non-conforming aspect of the structure;
c. The new addition to and/or alteration of the structure, in and of itself, complies
with all the required dimensional controls;
d. The overall structure and site, with the addition and/or alterations, complies
with all the required dimensional controls, with the exception of the existing
legal non-conformity, and does not result in the need for any waivers to the
dimensional controls or any other relevant development requirement or
standard, established within the Unified Development code, including but not
limited to parking, landscaping, signage, etc.; and
e. The existing and proposed use(s) within the structure must be permitted use(s)
within the respective zoning district in which the property and structure are
located.
2. Zoning Board of Appeals Review: Nonconforming structures, which do not meet the
criteria established in 12-15-4:A.1., may be expanded and altered, provided that
the expansion or alteration meets the criteria of an authorized variation by the
zoning board of appeals, and that the zoning board of appeals finds that an undue
hardship is imposed on the owner of the structure and does not adversely affect
the adjoining property.
B. Damage To Nonconforming Structures: If a nonconforming structure is destroyed or
damaged by a fire, flood, windstorm, or similar abnormal and identifiable event, and
the cost of restoring the structure to its condition immediately prior to the event:
1. Does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the cost of restoring the entire structure,
then the structure may be restored to its original nonconforming condition,
provided that a building permit is secured, reconstruction is initiated within one
year from the date of the damage, and such reconstruction is diligently pursued to
completion.
2. Exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the cost of restoring the entire structure. The
structure shall not be restored unless the structure, as restored, and the use, will
thereafter conform to all requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. A
nonconforming structure which is a permitted use in a residential district may be
restored provided a variation is granted by the zoning board of appeals.
C. Moving A Nonconforming Structure: A nonconforming structure may not be moved or
relocated in whole or in part, unless such move or relocation causes the structure to
conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is subsequently located.
(Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
12-15-5: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
Nonconforming lots of record which do not meet the lot width and/or lot area requirements at
the effective date of this title or any subsequent amendment shall be governed by the
following provisions:
A. Nonconforming Lots In Residential Districts: A nonconforming lot of record, recorded
prior to August 4, 1959, not meeting the requirements of this title as to lot area or lot
width, owned separately and individually from all adjoining tracts of land, may be used
for a single-family dwelling providing the zoning board of appeals finds that an undue
hardship is imposed on the owner and the use of the nonconforming lot does not
adversely affect the adjoining property.
B. Common Ownership Of Lots Or Parts Of Lots:
1. Where two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the effective date of this
title or any subsequent amendment, and where the splitting of lots or part of the
lots will not meet the requirements established for lot width and lot area, the lots

specifications contained in chapter 11, "Landscaping And Trees", and chapter 12,
"Design Standards", of this title, only when such variations are in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of the design standards, and only when the appearance
review commission finds that in certain circumstances involving the size, shape,
topography, location or surroundings affect the property referred to in the
application, when denial of said application will cause unreasonable or unnecessary
hardship, and/or when said variation will not cause substantial injury to the value
of other property within the vicinity nor be detrimental to the public safety or
welfare in the neighborhood in which it is located.
a. Variance Procedures: Applications for variances shall be made in writing on
forms provided by the village. Upon receipt of written request for a variance,
the appearance review commission shall schedule a public hearing, to be

To that end, the zoning board of appeals shall have the same authority and be
subject to the same standards and limitations as the building commissioner or
other village official with respect to the action being appealed.
5. Conditions On Rights Granted By Appeal: In a case where this title imposes

its deliberations.
4. Plan Commission Hearing: Upon receipt of an application which satisfies the
foregoing requirements and has been through procedural control, a public hearing
shall be set by the building commissioner or his designee within forty five (45) days
of the staff/applicant conference, and advertised in accordance with the
requirements set forth in subsequent section 12-16-5, "Public Hearings", the
building commissioner or his designee shall transmit all pertinent documents to the
plan commission prior to the required public hearing.
5. Plan Commission Action: Within forty five (45) days following the conclusion of the

substantial compliance with and does not change the intent of the original
ordinance, a memorandum will be sent to the board of trustees describing the
proposed modification, containing findings as to its impact and specific
recommendations, if any.
If they find that the modification is not in substantial compliance or changes the
intent of the original ordinance, then the formal plan commission procedure,
above, must be repeated.
4. Board Approval: The board of trustees shall review each request for an abbreviated
amendment. If the amendment is granted, the board of trustees shall make a
finding that the requested amendment is in substantial compliance with the
originally enacted ordinance.
C. Special Use Permits:
1. Purpose: Certain uses because of their unique characteristics cannot be properly
classified in any district without consideration of their impact upon adjacent land
use and the public need for the specific use in that particular location, and thus
require plan commission and village board evaluation. The special uses within each
zoning district are identified in chapter 4, "Zoning Districts", of this title.
2. Application Requirements: An application for a special use may be filed only by the
owner or another person having a contractual ownership interest in the subject

recommendation. Information which will be required is provided on an application
form available in the building department and shall be reviewed with the applicant

Commission Procedure", of this section.
4. Conditions Of Special Uses: The plan commission may impose conditions and
restrictions regarding the construction, location, and operation of a special use, as
requirements for approval. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions shall
constitute a violation of this title and provide grounds for revocation of the permit
for such special use.
5. Standards For Special Uses: The following standards for evaluating special uses
shall be applied in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration the restrictions
and/or limitations which exist for the site being considered for development:
a. Preservation Of Health, Safety, Morals, And Welfare: The establishment,
maintenance and operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or
endanger the public health, safety, morals or general welfare.
b. Adjacent Properties: The special use should not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the uses permitted in
the zoning district.
c. Orderly Development: The establishment of the special use will not impede
normal and orderly development or impede the utilization of surrounding
property for uses permitted in the zoning district.
d. Adequate Facilities: Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other
necessary facilities are in existence or are being provided.
e. Traffic Control: Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the public
streets. The proposed use of the subject site should not draw substantial
amounts of traffic on local residential streets.
f. Adequate Buffering: Adequate fencing and/or screening shall be provided to
ensure the right of enjoyment of surrounding properties to provide for the
public safety or to screen parking areas and other visually incompatible uses.
g. Conformance To Other Regulations: The special use shall, in all other respects,
conform to applicable provisions of this title or amendments thereto. Variation
from provisions of this title as provided for in subsection 12-16-3A, "Variations",
of this chapter, may be considered by the plan commission and the village
board of trustees as a part of the special use permit.
6. Effects Of Decisions On Special Use Permits:

not be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the decision,
except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions.
b. Effect Of Issuance Of Special Use Permit: The issuance of a permit for a special
use shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building
or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of
applications for any permits or approvals which may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the village, including, but not limited to, a building permit, a
certificate of occupancy, or subdivision approval.
c. Time Limit For Special Use Permits: A permit for a special use shall be valid for a
period no longer than one year from the date of issue unless a building permit
is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter
actively pursued to completion or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a
use commenced within that period.
d. Effects Of Withdrawal: A petitioner may withdraw a petition from consideration
at any time prior to a public hearing before the plan commission with the effect
of eliminating the matter from further consideration except by initiation of an
entirely new petition. Such a voluntary withdrawal shall not be considered a
denial by the plan commission or the board of trustees. (Ord. 07-07, 3-26-2007)
7. Revocation: In the event of an alleged violation of the provisions of any special use
granted pursuant to this chapter, notice of such violation shall be served upon the
applicant to whom the special use was granted. Following the service of a written
notice, violation of the special use shall be corrected within a reasonable amount of
time as determined based upon the circumstances of the violation. If within the
period of time contained in the written notice, the person receiving such an order
presents an executed contract or other verifiable documentation that the work
necessary to eliminate the violation is underway, and if the appropriate village staff
is satisfied that work is in progress and a diligent effort is underway to correct the
violation, extensions of time may be granted at the discretion of the building
commissioner. The building commissioner may also issue a fine pursuant to section
12-16-6, "Violation, Penalty, And Enforcement", of this chapter. Although, planned
unit developments (PUDs) are special uses, revocation of a PUD shall be in

granted to give said applicant an opportunity to appear and defend. The notice
shall set out a description of the violation and a date and place for a hearing, which
shall be at least three (3) days subsequent to the date the notice is served. The
notice may be served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested,
upon the aforesaid applicant or his/her agents or responsible employees, or if there
is a reasonable inability to effect service in the aforementioned manner, then
service may be made by posting in a conspicuous location on the premises.
The hearing on the violation shall be before a three (3) person board which shall be
comprised of the chairman of the plan commission or a member of the commission
designated by the chairman, who shall act as board chairman, the village president
or a trustee designated by the village president and the village attorney or a
