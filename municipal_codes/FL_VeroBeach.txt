PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Vero Beach, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through June 18, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Charter of the city as enacted at the election on March 9, 1982. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

(1)  Public opportunity to be heard. Members of the public shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard on a proposition before the council. The opportunity to be heard need not occur at the same meeting at which the council takes official action on the proposition if the opportunity occurs at a meeting that is during the decision-making process and is within reasonable proximity in time before the meeting at which the council takes the official action.

(2)  By all persons. No person shall make any personal, impertinent, slanderous, obscene, profane, inflammatory, untruthful, irrelevant, or immaterial remarks, or become boisterous while in the council chambers, or incite violence or fighting, or otherwise disturb the meeting, whether or not while addressing the council.

Any person so removed shall be barred from further attendance at the meeting in question, unless permission to remain is granted by a majority vote of the council. A person who violates the meeting order and decorum or otherwise disturbs the meeting may also be prosecuted pursuant to general law.

Sec. 2-57. - Ex parte communications. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to remove the presumption of prejudice from certain ex parte communications with local public officials of the city regarding quasi-judicial matters and proceedings by establishing a process to disclose ex parte communications with such local public officials pursuant to F.S. § 286.0115. 
(b)  Local public officials. As used in this section, the term "local public official" means any elected or appointed public official holding a city office who recommends or takes quasi-judicial action as a member of the city council or a city board or commission. 
(c)  Ex parte communications not precluded; procedure for disclosure. Pursuant to F.S. § 286.0115, the following ex parte communications with local public officials are not precluded and adherence to the procedures provided for below shall remove the presumption of prejudice arising from such ex parte communications: 
(1)  Any person not otherwise prohibited by statute, charter provision, or ordinance may discuss with any local public official the merits of any matter on which action may be taken by the city council or any board or commission on which the local public official is a member. The substance of any ex parte communication with a local public official which relates to quasi-judicial action pending before the official is not presumed prejudicial to the action if the subject of the communication and the identity of the person, group, or entity with whom the communication took place is disclosed and made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
(2)  A local public official may read a written communication from any person. However, a written communication that relates to quasi-judicial action pending before a local public official shall not be presumed prejudicial to the action, and such written communication shall be made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
(3)  Local public officials may conduct investigations and site visits and may receive expert opinions regarding quasi-judicial action pending before them. Such activities shall not be presumed prejudicial to the action if the existence of the investigation, site visit, or expert opinion is made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
(4)  Disclosure made pursuant to subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) must be made before or during the public meeting at which a vote is taken on such matters, so that persons who have opinions contrary to those expressed in the ex parte communication are given a reasonable opportunity to refute or respond to the communication. 
(d)  Failure to comply with disclosure requirements. The disclosure requirements set forth in subsection (c) above or a local public official's failure to comply with such requirements shall not: 
(1)  Be deemed an essential requirement of the law or this Code; 
(2)  Create any presumption of prejudice or be conclusive evidence of prejudice; 
(3)  Lessen the burden of proof for a party alleging that an ex parte communication is prejudicial; or 
(4)  Affect the validity of the public hearing or quasi-judicial action, unless the nondisclosure and ex parte communication are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prejudicial and a denial of due process.

(4)  Present and prosecute code enforcement cases before the board. 
(b)  Commencement of code enforcement action; citations. Whenever, based upon personal investigation, an officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a violation of a code provision subject to enforcement under this article has occurred or exists, the officer finding such violation may issue a code enforcement citation to the violator. When more than one violation of the same or different code provisions is found by an officer to have occurred or exist at the same property or location such multiple violations may be cited on a single citation specifying the combined civil penalties assessed for all of the violations or such multiple violations may be cited on separate citations. If the officer finds that a violation is correctable, the officer shall determine a reasonable time period within which the violator must correct the violation. This determination shall be based on considerations of fairness; practicality; ease of correction; ability to correct; severity of the violation; nature, extent and probability of danger or damage to the public; and any other relevant factors relating to the reasonableness of the time period prescribed by the officer. The officer shall specify on the citation the date by which correction must be made in order to avoid further enforcement action, however, the officer is not required to give the violator time to correct the violation and a time period for correction need not be specified if the officer determines the violation to be uncorrectable or a repeat violation. 
(c)  Warnings. A code enforcement citation or a separate document may be issued as a warning with no civil penalty as the first response to a violation in any instance in which it is reasonable for the officer to determine that the violator was unaware of the code provision violated or the violator was unclear as to how to comply with such code provision. Multiple violations found at the same location may be specified in a single warning. Issuance of a warning shall not be deemed to be a prerequisite to issuance of a citation assessing a civil penalty or any other enforcement action. 
(d)  Service of citations and warnings. Service of a code enforcement citation or warning shall be effected by: 
(1)  Delivery of a copy to the violator or the violator's authorized agent by a code enforcement officer; or 
(2)  A code enforcement officer leaving a copy of the citation at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is 15 years of age or older and informing that person of its contents; or 
(3)  A code enforcement officer leaving a copy of the citation with the manager or other person in charge in the case of commercial premises or real property; or 
(4)  Mailing a copy of the citation by certified mail, with delivery evidenced by a signed return receipt, to the violator's last known mailing address as listed in the tax records of Indian River County, the records of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the records of the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations, the records of the city, or other mailing address provided to the city or the code enforcement officer by the violator or the violator's agent; or 
(5)  Posting a copy of the citation in a conspicuous place on the premises or real property upon which the violation has been observed and mailing a copy by first class mail to or posting in a conspicuous place at the violator's last known mailing address as determined in paragraph (4). Service by such posting and first class mailing shall be evidenced by an affidavit of service and shall be deemed sufficient and complete upon such posting and mailing; or 
(6)  If the violator is a legal entity other than a natural person, serving, in any manner provided in this section, any officer, partner, member, or registered agent of such entity as listed in the records of the State of Florida or the state or country in which the entity is organized if not registered in this state; or 
(7)  If the citation or a separate document is issued as a warning, first class mailing to the violator's last known mailing address as determined in paragraph (4) or by any other method provided for service in this section. Service of a warning by first class mail shall be deemed sufficient and complete on mailing to such address. 
(e)  Contents of citation. The code enforcement citation shall include the following: 
(1)  Date of issuance. 
(2)  Name of officer and division or department issuing the citation. 
(3)  Name and address of the violator. 
(4)  Section number of the code provision that has been violated. 
(5)  Brief factual description of the nature of the violation, including location, date, and time of violation. 
(6)  Amount of the applicable civil penalty to be paid if the violator elects to pay the civil penalty and amount of the maximum civil penalty for which the violator may be liable if the violator elects to appear before the board and is found by the board, after the hearing, to have committed the violation. 
(7)  Instructions and due date for paying the civil penalty or filing for an administrative hearing to appeal the issuance of the citation. 
(8)  Time within which the violation must be corrected, if applicable. 
(9)  Notice that each day of continued violation after the time period for correction has run shall be deemed a continuing violation subject to assessment of additional penalties, without the need for issuance of additional citations, if applicable. 
(10)  Notice that the violator must notify the officer after the violation is corrected, if applicable. 
(11)  If issued as a violation warning, notice that a repeat of the same violation, even if the violation occurs at a different location, or failure to correct the violation within the time period given for correction in the warning, will result in issuance of a citation assessing a civil penalty. 
(12)  Notice that the filing of a request for an administrative hearing will toll the accrual of continuing violation penalties. 
(13)  Notice that failure to request an administrative hearing within ten days after service of the civil violation notice, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing and that such waiver shall constitute an admission of the violation. 
(14)  Notice that the violator may be liable for the reasonable costs of the administrative hearing if the violator is found to have committed the violation. 
(15)  Notice that the violator may be liable for the costs and expenses incurred by the city as a result of the enforcement action if the violator is found to have committed the violation. 
(16)  Notice that if the violator does not correct the violation, if applicable, or request a hearing within the time allowed, the city may cause correction of the violation and charge the violator for the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city for such correction plus an administrative fee, which expenses and fees shall be a lien against the property on which the violation is corrected. 
(f)  Filing of citation; recording. After serving the code enforcement citation, the officer shall deposit the original and one copy of the citation with the board clerk. A certified copy of the code enforcement citation or a notice of violation based upon the citation may be recorded in the public records of the county. Such recording under this section shall not act as or be a lien on any property and shall not act as a notice of a lien on any property, but shall merely act as public notice of the existence of the violation. Warnings shall not be filed with the board clerk or recorded in the public records, but shall be retained in the records of the city department or division issuing the warning. 
(g)  Citation amendment. A code enforcement citation may be amended by the city at any time prior to final adjudication by filing an amended citation with the board clerk and providing a copy to the violator. After amendment the case shall proceed on the amended citation, however the board may postpone any hearing based on the amended citation as justice may require. 
(h)  Citation withdrawal. A code enforcement citation may be withdrawn by the city at any time prior to final adjudication. A citation filed with the board clerk shall be withdrawn by the city filing a written notice of withdrawal with the board clerk and providing a copy to the violator or by oral announcement before the board at a hearing noticed to the violator, in which case the withdrawal shall be noted in the record. After withdrawal of the citation the board clerk shall close the case. 
(i)  Stop orders; appeal; non-compliance. Whenever, based upon personal investigation, the officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe an unsafe condition exists or may result in damage to persons or property may occur due to continuation of the work or activities comprising the violation, or if the violation concerns the failure to obtain any required administrative approval, permit, inspection, or license prior to commencing or continuing the work or activities, the officer may order the work or activity immediately stopped by service of a stop order in the same manner as a code enforcement citation. Failure to comply with the stop order and cease the work or activities shall be a separate violation of this code and shall be punished by a civil penalty of $500.00 per day for each day the stop order is violated. Appeal of the issuance of a stop order shall be to the issuing officer's department head, in writing, within ten days of service of the stop order and thereafter as provided in the general appeal provisions of this code for appeal of administrative decisions. The work or activities subject of the stop order shall be stayed pending final resolution of the appeal. Appeal of the issuance of a code enforcement citation for violation of a stop order shall be as provided for appeal of the issuance of any other code enforcement citation. A stop order may be amended, modified, cancelled, or withdrawn by the issuing officer as the circumstances require, in which case the violator shall be notified of such action. 
(j)  Refusal to sign citation; interference with officer; impersonating officer. Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept service of a code enforcement citation personally served by any code enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree as provided by F.S. §§ 162.21(6), 489.127(5)(m), 489.531(4)(m), or 828.27(5), and punishable as provided in F.S. §§ 775.082 and 775.083. Any person who otherwise willfully interferes with any code enforcement officer in the performance of the officer's official duties, or who falsely represents himself to be a code enforcement officer, shall be guilty of a violation of this Code punishable as provided in section 1-14 of this Code.

Sec. 2-297. - Violator duty to inform property transferee. 
    If the violator is the owner of the real property or commercial enterprise that is subject to an enforcement action concerning a correctable violation and such violator transfers ownership of the property or commercial enterprise after service of the code enforcement citation, such violator shall: 
(1)  Disclose to the prospective transferee, in writing, the existence and the nature of the enforcement action. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the citations and notices and other materials relating to the enforcement action received by the violator. 
(3)  Disclose to the prospective transferee, in writing, that the new owner will be responsible for correction of the violation and compliance with the applicable code provisions and orders issued in the code enforcement action. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement officer of the transfer of ownership, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
    Failure of the violator to make the disclosures described in subsections (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer of ownership creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud, and unless such presumption is rebutted and the new owner is shown to be responsible for correcting the violation and paying the accrued civil penalties and costs, such violator shall be responsible for all civil penalties and costs assessed for the violation through the date of its correction. If ownership is transferred before the enforcement action is concluded, the case shall not be dismissed and may proceed against the violator for any outstanding civil penalties and costs, however, the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation prior to enforcement action being initiated against the new owner.

Sec. 2-299. - Time computation.

Sec. 2-300. - Civil penalties. 
(a)  Generally. Each violation of a code provision enforced pursuant to the procedures specified in this article shall constitute a civil offense punishable as provided in this article. 
(b)  Maximum penalty. Except as otherwise provided for the specified code provision violated, each violation of a code provision enforced under this article shall be punishable by assessment of a civil penalty not exceeding $500.00. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense punishable by such maximum civil penalty. In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the board shall consider: (1) the gravity of the violation; (2) any actions taken by the violator to correct or mitigate the violation; and (3) any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(c)  Reduced penalty for uncontested violation. Except as otherwise provided by the code provisions applicable, a violator that does not contest the violation alleged in the citation shall be entitled to pay a reduced civil penalty in the following prescribed amounts: 
First violation ..... $50.00 
First repeat violation within five (5) years ..... $100.00 
Second repeat violation within five (5) years ..... $150.00 
Third repeat violation within five (5) years ..... $250.00 
Fourth and subsequent repeat violations within five (5) years ..... $500.00 
(d)  Waiver of right to pay reduced penalty. A violator that elects to appear before the board waives the right to pay the reduced civil penalty specified on the citation. 
(e)  Repeat uncorrectable violation. Each reoccurrence of an uncorrectable violation shall constitute a separate violation and shall subject the violator to a separate civil penalty in the same amount as prescribed for the first violation. If, however, a violator has been previously found guilty of or admitted an uncorrectable violation and causes the same uncorrectable violation to occur a second or subsequent time within five years of the prior violation, notwithstanding the violations occur at different locations, each reoccurrence of the uncorrectable violation by such violator shall constitute a repeat violation. 
(f)  Continuing violation. For each day of continued violation after the time for correction of a correctable violation has run, an additional penalty in the same amount as that prescribed for the first violation shall be added. Unless an appeal is timely filed, continuing violation penalties shall accrue commencing with the first day after the date for correction given in the code enforcement citation or board order and continue until the date the correction is made. Continuing violation penalties shall not be imposed for uncorrectable violations. 
(g)  Continuing repeat violation. A repeat correctable violation that remains uncorrected beyond the time prescribed for correction shall be treated as a continuing violation, except that the continuing violation penalties may be assessed by the board commencing with the first day after the date the repeat violation first occurred and continue until the date correction is made. 
(h)  Assessment of penalty after contested violation hearing. 
(1)  Uncorrectable violation. A violator found by the board, after the hearing, to have violated the provision of the code alleged in the citation that is an uncorrectable or repeat uncorrectable violation, may be punished by assessment of a civil penalty of not more than the maximum civil penalty for such violation. 
(2)  Correctable violation. If the board finds, after the hearing, that the alleged correctable violation exists, the board may assess for the initial violation a civil penalty of not more than the maximum civil penalty for such violation; shall order that the violation be corrected within a reasonable time period as determined by the considerations set forth in subsection 2-296(b); and shall establish the continuing civil penalty to be assessed should the violator not correct the violation within the time allowed. If correction is not made by the set time, the board may assess the continuing violation penalties for each day the violation continues past the date set for correction. Except as provided for a repeat correctable violation, continuing violation penalties shall not be assessed for the time period commencing the first day after the date the violation first occurred, as found by the board, through the date established by the board for correction. 
(3)  Repeat correctable violation. If the board finds, after the hearing, that the alleged repeat correctable violation exists, the board may assess for the initial repeat violation a civil penalty of not more than the maximum civil penalty for such violation; shall order that the violation be corrected within a reasonable time period as determined by the considerations set forth in subsection 2-296(b) and taking into consideration the repeat nature of the violation; and shall establish the continuing civil penalty to be imposed should the violator not correct the violation within the time allowed. If correction is not made by the set time, the board may assess the continuing violation penalties for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the first day after the date the repeat violation first occurred, as found by the board. 
(Ord. No. 2013-05, § 2, 1-22-2013; Ord. No. 2015-17, § 2, 7-21-2015; Ord. No. 2018-07, § 2, 6-19-2018) 
Sec. 2-301. - Rights of violators; appeal; assessment and payment of civil penalties and costs; failure to pay or correct, or to appeal. 
(a)  Code enforcement citation. A violator who has been served with a code enforcement citation shall elect either to: 
(1)  Pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the citation and correct the violation, if a correctable violation, within the time specified on the citation; or 
(2)  Appeal by administrative hearing the issuance of the citation by filing a written request for a hearing with the board clerk no later than ten days after service of the citation, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, a violator that files, within such time period, an administrative appeal to the designated administrative authority of the city regarding the interpretation or application of any code provision alleged in the citation to be violated shall have ten days from the date of the final determination of such administrative appeal to file a written request for a hearing on the citation with the board clerk, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. Failure of the violator to appeal within the prescribed time period shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing on the citation. Such a waiver of the right to an administrative hearing shall be deemed an admission of the violation and thereafter penalties and costs may be assessed and other appropriate action taken accordingly by the board. 
(b)  Warning. A violator who has been served with a code enforcement warning shall refrain from repeating the violation. If a correctable violation, the violator shall correct the violation within the time specified on the warning. The violator may be given an opportunity to enter into a compliance agreement as provided in section 2-302. The issuance of a warning is not appealable as a warning does not impose a civil penalty or other deprivation of property subject to review. 
(c)  Due date. Unless additional time is granted by the board for good cause, civil penalties and costs assessed pursuant to this article are due and payable to the city on the last day of the period allowed for the filing of a request for an administrative hearing or for the filing of an appeal from a board decision, or if proper appeal is made, when the appeal has been finally decided adversely to the violator, if applicable. 
(d)  Failure to pay penalty or appeal. If the violator, after service of the code enforcement citation for an uncorrectable violation or for a correctable violation that is corrected within the time specified in the citation, fails to pay the civil penalty by the due date and fails to timely request an administrative hearing, the board shall be informed of such failure by report from the officer or board clerk and the board may thereafter enter an order ordering the violator to pay the civil penalty specified on the citation or take such other action as the board deems appropriate under the circumstances and in the interest of justice. The city shall be entitled to also recover costs of the action from the violator upon filing of an affidavit of the costs with the board clerk, which costs shall be included in the order. At least ten days before the hearing, the board clerk shall send the violator notice of the hearing at which such report of non-compliance will be made, together with a copy of any affidavits filed. The case may be presented to the board even if the civil penalty is subsequently paid prior to the board hearing, and the notice of hearing shall so state. 
(e)  Failure to correct violation or appeal. If the violator, after service of the code enforcement citation for a correctable violation, fails to correct the violation within the time specified in the citation and fails to timely request an administrative hearing, the board shall be informed of such failure by report from the officer and filing with the board clerk an affidavit of non-compliance. The board may thereafter enter an appropriate order directing the violator to correct the violation and assessing civil penalties and costs, grant additional time for correction of the violation, or take such other action as the board deems appropriate under the circumstances and in the interest of justice. The city shall be entitled to also recover costs of the action from the violator upon filing of an affidavit of the costs with the board clerk, which costs shall be included in any order issued by the board. At least ten days before the hearing, the board clerk shall send the violator notice of the hearing at which such report of non-compliance will be made, together with a copy of any affidavits filed. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified by the code enforcement officer for correction, the case may be presented to the board even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice of hearing shall so state. 
(f)  Failure to comply with board order or appeal. If the violator, when an adverse board order is rendered after an administrative hearing on a contested violation, fails to correct the violation within the time specified in the order or fails to pay the civil penalties or costs assessed, and fails to timely appeal the board decision, the board shall be informed of such failure by report from the officer and filing with the board clerk an affidavit of non-compliance and the board may thereafter enter an appropriate order or take such other action as the board deems appropriate under the circumstances and in the interest of justice. The city shall be entitled to also recover any additional costs of the action from the violator upon request of the city and filing of an affidavit of costs with the board clerk. At least ten days before the hearing, the board clerk shall send the violator notice of the hearing at which such report of non-compliance will be made, together with a copy of any affidavits filed. The case may be presented to the board even if the violation has been corrected and the civil penalties and costs have been paid prior to the board hearing, and the notice of hearing shall so state. 
(g)  Service of orders. The board clerk shall send a copy of all board orders entered to the violator and the code enforcement officer. 
(Ord. No. 2013-05, § 2, 1-22-2013; Ord. No. 2015-03, § 2, 1-6-2015; Ord. No. 2015-17, § 2, 7-21-2015) 
Sec. 2-302. - Compliance agreements. 
(a)  Waiver of hearing to contest citation; additional time to correct. A violator that agrees with a correctable violation specified in the code enforcement citation, but requests additional time to correct the violation, may be given an opportunity to avoid further enforcement action by executing a compliance agreement in lieu of electing one of the options under section 2-301(a). Acceptance for participation in a compliance agreement shall be determined in the discretion of the code enforcement officer and such officer's supervisor in consideration of fairness; ease of correction of the violation; the severity of the violation; the violator's demonstrated cooperation; the likelihood of a successful outcome; whether the violation is a repeat violation; and any other relevant factors. If approved for participation, the violator shall execute a compliance agreement admitting to the violation and waiving the right to an administrative hearing to contest the issuance of the citation. The violator shall then have such reasonable additional time agreed to between the violator and the code enforcement officer to correct the violation before continuing penalties will begin to accrue. The code enforcement officer may extend, no more than one time and with the approval of the officer's supervisor, such agreed additional time if the violator demonstrates good faith and progress in making the correction and that a reasonable need for an extension of time exists. 
(b)  Contents of compliance agreement. The compliance agreement shall be in writing on a form provided by the city. Such form shall include but is not limited to the following: 
(1)  The violator's admission of the violation and acknowledgment that the violator has an absolute right to have an administrative hearing to contest the issuance of the code enforcement citation; the waiver of the right to an administrative hearing is solely the violator's option; and by signing the waiver the violator voluntarily waives the right to such a hearing. 
(2)  The agreed date by which the violation must be corrected or continuing civil penalties will begin to accrue. 
(3)  The amount of the daily continuing civil penalty that will be assessed if the violation is not corrected by the agreed correction date. 
(4)  The violator's agreement to correct the violation by the agreed correction date. 
(5)  The violator's agreement to pay by an agreed date the civil penalty assessed on the citation, city's costs incurred in the case, and the cost of re-inspection, except to the extent any of such civil penalty or costs are waived by the city. 
(6)  The action or inaction required of the violator to correct the violation. 
(7)  The violator's agreement that if the violation is not corrected or the costs are not paid by the agreed correction date the board may enter an order assessing the daily continuing penalties and the costs, plus any additional costs incurred by the city subsequent to the waiver. 
(8)  If applicable based on the nature of the violation, the violator's agreement that if the violation is not corrected by the agreed correction date, regardless of whether or not it is deemed a public nuisance, the city or its contractors may enter the property without liability to the violator and without further notice to the violator and make all reasonable repairs and perform all work required to correct the violation at the violator's expense and assess such costs plus an administrative fee as a special assessment against the property on which the violation was corrected. 
(c)  Hearing on non-compliance. If the violator fails to correct the violation or pay the civil penalty or costs as agreed by the violator, the board shall be informed of such failure by report from the officer and filing with the board clerk an affidavit of non-compliance. The issues for determination by the board at the hearing shall be limited to whether or not the violation was corrected and the civil penalty and costs paid as agreed by the violator. At least ten days before the hearing, the board clerk shall send the violator notice of the hearing at which such report of non-compliance will be made, together with a copy of any affidavits filed. The case may be presented to the board even if the violation has been corrected and the civil penalty and costs have been paid prior to the board hearing, and the notice of hearing shall so state. 
(d)  Board action after non-compliance. If the board finds, after the hearing, that the violation has not been corrected, the board may enter an order ordering the violator to correct the violation and assessing the continuing penalties and, if the initial civil penalty or costs are unpaid, ordering the violator to pay such civil penalty and costs. If the finding is that the violation has been corrected, but the civil penalty or costs have not been paid, the board may enter an order ordering the violator to pay such unpaid civil penalty and costs. The board shall also assess in any order entered against the violator any additional costs incurred and requested by the city subsequent to the waiver of hearing. The board may grant the violator additional time for compliance if the board finds that the violator has demonstrated good faith and progress in correction of the violation, if applicable, and shown a reasonable need for an extension of time to complete correction of the violation or pay the civil penalty and costs. The board clerk shall send a copy of the board order to the violator and the code enforcement officer. 
(e)  Correction of violation by city; assessment of costs. Whenever the board enters a final order pursuant to this section finding that the violation has not been corrected, and the nature of the violation is such that it lends itself to correction by the city, the city manager may, pursuant to the purchasing requirements of this code and the compliance agreement, immediately cause all reasonable repairs and work to be done to correct the violation, regardless of whether or not the violation is deemed a public nuisance. The city manager may employ such city or contracted labor and materials as the city manager finds reasonably necessary to correct the violation. Entry on the real property and making such repairs or corrections to correct the violation shall not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or corrections or to maintain the property and shall not create any liability against the city or any official, employee or contractor of the city for any damages to the property if entry on the property and the repairs and work are made in good faith to correct the violation. The reasonable costs incurred by the city for the repairs and work to correct the violation, plus an administrative fee of ten percent or $150.00, whichever is greater, shall be assessed as a special assessment lien by resolution of the city council as provided in subsections 2-304(b) and (c) against the real property on which the violation was corrected. 
(f)  Agreement to correct violation after warning. A violator that agrees with a correctable violation specified in the warning, but requests additional time to correct the violation, may be given an opportunity to enter into a compliance agreement to suspend code enforcement action and correct the violation pursuant to the applicable provisions of this section. Such compliance agreement may require the payment of costs. The remedy for failure of the violator to correct the violation as agreed or otherwise satisfy the terms of the compliance agreement shall be limited to issuance of a code enforcement citation as if the compliance agreement had not been entered into by the violator. In such instance, the compliance agreement and any admissions and waivers contained therein shall be of no further force and effect and shall be inadmissible in any subsequent code enforcement action. 
(Ord. No. 2013-05, § 2, 1-22-2013; Ord. No. 2015-03, § 3, 1-6-2015; Ord. No. 2015-17, § 2, 7-21-2015)

Transcription of such verbatim hearing record shall be at the expense of the requesting party. 
(k)  Prosecution of case. Each case shall be presented before the board by the initiating officer or other designee as the city manager may appoint from time to time. The city manager is authorized to retain legal counsel to serve as prosecutor in those cases deemed necessary by the city manager. 
(l)  Rules of evidence. Formal rules relating to evidence and witnesses shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings.

(p)  Costs. If the violator is found to have committed the violation, the board shall assess against the violator the reasonable costs of the administrative hearing and the reasonable costs incurred by the city in the enforcement action. The costs and expenses requested by the city for reimbursement shall be calculated and submitted to the board for assessment at the hearing. 
(q)  Board determination; time to correct violation; board order. The determination of the board for purposes of a contested code enforcement citation shall be limited to fact-finding as to whether or not the violation alleged did occur or exists and, if so, whether the person or entity named in the citation is responsible for that violation. The findings and determination of the board shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing and the interpretation and application of the code provisions alleged to be violated as such interpretation and application is determined by the designated administrative authority of the city. If the board finds the violator responsible for a correctable violation, the board shall determine a reasonable time period within which correction of the violation must be made, as determined by the considerations set forth in subsection 2-296(b) and taking into consideration whether the violation is a repeat violation, provided however, that such time period shall be no more than 30 days unless the board determines that a longer time period is reasonable and necessary based on the evidence presented. If the board finds that the violator is not responsible for the violation alleged in the code enforcement citation, the violator shall not be liable for the payment of any civil penalty or costs, absent reversal of the board's findings after an appeal. If the decision of the board is to find the violator responsible for the violation alleged, then the following elements shall be included in the board's final order, a copy of which shall be sent by the board clerk to the violator and the code enforcement officer:

(6)  Notice that failure to comply with the board's order on a continuing violation will result in the issuance of an appropriate order assessing the continuing penalties; 
(7)  If the board finds that the violation exists and constitutes a public nuisance representing a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, notice that the violation is deemed a public nuisance and should the violator fail to correct the violation and abate such public nuisance or appeal within the time allowed, the city or its contractors may enter the property and cause the repairs or work reasonably necessary to correct the violation and abate the public nuisance with the costs and expenses incurred by the city for such correction, plus an administrative fee, charged as a special assessment lien against the property on which the violation was corrected; 
(8)  Notice of the right to appeal the board action to the circuit court. 
(r)  Code interpretation; appeal; postponement of hearing; administrative interpretation binding. 
(1)  A violator that contests the interpretation or application of any code provision alleged in the citation to be violated shall appeal the determination of such interpretation or application to the designated administrative authority of the city in the manner specified in this Code or such appeal shall be deemed waived. The violator shall not be charged an administrative appeal fee when filing such an appeal arising from issuance of the citation, however the board shall assess such fees as costs against the violator upon request of the city if the board's final determination on the citation is against the violator. 
(2)  The board shall postpone the hearing and the board's determination on the citation if the violator contests at the hearing the interpretation or application of any code provision alleged in the citation to be violated or if the violator has filed with the designated administrative authority a written administrative appeal concerning the subject interpretation or application and the appeal has not been finally determined. If such written appeal has not been filed at the time of the hearing, the board shall grant the violator ten days from the date of the hearing to file the written appeal and provide a copy to the board clerk. If the violator fails to file the appeal with the designated administrative authority by the end of such period, the board clerk shall automatically schedule the hearing on the appeal of the citation for the next available board meeting. It shall be the responsibility of the violator to provide evidence to the board clerk that such administrative appeal has been timely filed. A violator waives all right to an administrative appeal concerning the interpretation or application of any code provision as it relates to the enforcement action if the violator does not timely apply for such appeal. 
(3)  Upon exhaustion of a timely filed administrative appeal to the designated administrative authority concerning the interpretation or application of any code provision alleged to be violated and final determination of such administrative appeal, the board may exercise all powers granted under this article consistent with such final determination. The board shall not, however, exercise any jurisdiction over such alleged code violation until the time allowed for appeal of such final determination of the administrative appeal has lapsed or until such further appeal has been exhausted. 
(4)  The board shall be bound by the determinations of the designated administrative authority concerning the interpretation and application of the codes, ordinances, rules, and regulations within the jurisdiction of such designated administrative authority. In the event the designated administrative authority determines that an alleged violation is not in accordance with such designated administrative authority's determination of the interpretation or application of the code provision on which the violation is based, the board shall not be empowered to proceed with the enforcement action. 
(s)  Designated administrative authority. For purposes of this article, "designated administrative authority" means the city official, department head or director, or his designee, having jurisdiction and responsibility for administration of the code, ordinance, rule, or regulation the interpretation or application of which is contested in the code enforcement action. Such term includes the city manager, city council, and designated city boards in the exercise of their jurisdiction and authority to hear and determine appeals from administrative decisions pursuant to this Code, but excludes the code enforcement board and any special magistrate. 
(Ord. No. 2013-05, § 2, 1-22-2013; Ord. No. 2015-03, § 4, 1-6-2015; Ord. No. 2015-17, § 2, 7-21-2015) 
Sec. 2-304. - Violation constituting public nuisance; correction by city; assessment of costs as lien. 
(a)  Violation constituting public nuisance; correction by city. Whenever the board enters an order finding a continuing violation exists that constitutes a public nuisance representing a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, the board clerk shall send a copy of such order to the violator, all mortgagees and other lienors having an interest in the real property as shown in the public records of the county, and to the code enforcement officer. If such violation remains unabated after the time for appeal has run and an appeal is not filed or the order is finally affirmed after appeal, the city manager may, subject to the purchasing provisions of this code, cause all reasonable repairs and work to be done to correct the violation and abate the public nuisance, and the order shall so state. The city manager may employ such city or contracted labor and materials as the city manager finds reasonably necessary to correct the violation and abate the public nuisance. Entry on the real property and making such repairs or corrections to abate the public nuisance shall not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or corrections or to maintain the property and shall not create any liability against the city or any official, employee or contractor of the city for any damages to the property if entry on the property and the repairs and work are made in good faith to abate the public nuisance. 
(b)  Costs of correction. The reasonable costs incurred by the city for the repairs and work to correct the violation and abate the public nuisance, plus an administrative fee of ten percent or $150.00, whichever is greater, shall be assessed against the real property on which the violation was corrected. Such assessment shall be levied by resolution of the city council and shall be a special assessment lien against the real property, which lien shall accrue interest at the legal rate as of the date the resolution is adopted. The city attorney shall prepare the lien resolution and record it in the public records of the county after its adoption. 
(c)  Notice of lien resolution hearing. At least ten days before the city council meeting at which the adoption of the lien resolution will be considered, the city clerk shall send notice of such meeting to the violator, all mortgagees and other lienors having an interest in the real property as shown in the public records of the county, and to the code enforcement officer. The violator, as well as such mortgagees and lienors, if any, may appear before the city council and shall be heard on the proposed lien resolution. 
(Ord. No. 2013-05, § 2, 1-22-2013; Ord. No. 2015-17, § 2, 7-21-2015) 
Sec. 2-305. - Recovery of unpaid civil penalties and costs; unpaid penalties and costs to constitute a lien; foreclosure; duration of liens; prohibition of administrative action. 
(a)  Judicial remedies. Upon approval of the city council, the city attorney may cause proceedings to be instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel correction of a violation, compel payment of civil penalties and costs assessed, or foreclose on any lien. 
(b)  Unpaid penalties and costs to constitute a lien; enforcement. A certified copy of a board order assessing a civil penalty or costs may be recorded in the public records of each jurisdiction where appropriate and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation occurred, if applicable, and a lien upon all other real and personal property owned by the violator at the time of such recording or thereafter acquired by the violator, except as otherwise provided by law. Such liens shall inure to the benefit of the city and may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the violator's personal property, but shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. The city may foreclose or otherwise execute on any lien that remains unpaid after 90 days from the recording of any such order. 
(c)  Duration of lien; foreclosure; attorneys' fees. No lien created pursuant to this article shall continue for a period longer than 20 years, unless within that time an action on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In such action, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in such action. In the event each party shall partially prevail in such action, costs and attorneys' fees shall be equitably apportioned between the parties by the court. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by commencement of an action on the lien shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded in the public records of the county. 
(d)  Discharge of liens. Any lien created pursuant to this article may be satisfied and discharged by paying to the city the amount of civil penalties and costs specified in the order or lien and accruing through the date of correction of the violation plus the cost of re-inspection, and all costs of repairs and work incurred by the city to correct the violation plus the administrative fee and interest, if applicable, together with all collection and administrative costs, recording fees, and costs and fees to prepare and record a release and satisfaction of the lien in the public records. The amount payable to satisfy any lien may be reduced only by approval of the city council, in its sole discretion. 
(e)  Release and satisfaction. When the amount payable under a lien has been received by the city, the city attorney shall cause evidence of the satisfaction and discharge of such lien to be prepared and executed and thereafter duly recorded in the public records of each appropriate jurisdiction. The city manager is authorized to execute any such release and satisfaction on behalf of the city upon collection of the full amount payable to the city. 
(f)  Use of collection agency. The city manager may, for the purpose of collecting any delinquent civil penalties or costs from a violator, whether or not reduced to a lien, contract with any debt collection agency or attorney doing business within or without this state for the collection of such delinquent civil penalties or costs and the costs of the collection. The costs of collection, including any reasonable attorney's fee, paid or owed to any collection agency or attorney retained by the city, shall be added to the balance owed and paid by the violator, in an amount not to exceed 40 percent of the amount owed at the time the matter is referred for collection. The city may share confidential information with such collection agency or attorney necessary for the collection. 
(g)  Prohibition of administrative action. Regardless of any other code provision and unless deemed necessary for correction or abatement of the violation or for compliance with section 2-308 regarding lien reductions, or in order to avoid imminent peril to life or property, no officer, official, agent, employee or board of the city shall approve, grant, or issue any operating permit, license, building permit, certificate of use or occupancy, variance, platting action, zoning action, or the like regarding or for the real property of any violator with: (1) any uncorrected violation of any code provision on such real property; (2) any unpaid civil penalty or costs arising from a code enforcement action regarding such real property; or (3) any unpaid code enforcement, correction, or abatement lien against such real property; any or all of which are outstanding or owed to the city pursuant to the provisions of this article or any other code provision. Appeal of any denial or refusal to act pursuant to this section shall be as provided in the general appeal provisions of this Code for appeal of an administrative decision and shall be a prerequisite to any judicial proceeding on the matter.

(a)  Rehearing; grounds. The board may rehear all or part of the issues in any enforcement action upon any party demonstrating sufficient grounds for a rehearing or on the board's own initiative. Sufficient grounds shall include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect of a party or the party's representative; 
(2)  Newly discovered evidence which could not have been timely discovered before the hearing resulting in entry of the board order by the exercise of due diligence, is more likely than not to change the outcome, was discovered after the conclusion of the hearing or proceeding, is material to the issues raised in the hearing or proceeding, and is not impeachment or cumulative evidence; 
(3)  Fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; or 
(4)  Lack of notice of the enforcement action or hearing. 
(b)  Written request required; time for request; hearing on request. A request for rehearing shall be in writing, specifying the specific grounds for the rehearing, and shall be filed with the board clerk no later than then ten days after rendition of the board order. A timely request may be amended to state new grounds in the discretion of the board at any time before the request is determined. The board clerk shall set and notice a hearing on an authorized and timely request for rehearing in the manner provided in this article for administrative hearings. If after the hearing the board finds sufficient grounds and grants the request, the rehearing may proceed at that time on the issues approved by the board for rehearing. In the alternative, the board may schedule the rehearing for a date and time certain as the board deems appropriate, in which case the board shall issue an order granting the rehearing, specifying the date and time for the rehearing and the issues on which the board granted rehearing. The board clerk shall serve a copy of the board order on the parties and provide a copy to the code enforcement officer. 
(c)  Time for appeal tolled; abandonment of request. An authorized and timely request for a rehearing under this section, until disposed of, tolls the time to file a notice of appeal of the final board action. A party, who files a request for rehearing and before the request is disposed of files an appeal from the same board order on which the rehearing is requested, is deemed to have abandoned the request for a rehearing. 
(d)  Amendment of orders. The board may take additional testimony and receive additional evidence, reconsider and amend its orders, or enter new orders, as the circumstances and justice requires. 
(Ord. No. 2013-05, § 2, 1-22-2013) 
Sec. 2-307. - Appeal of board order; admissibility of board action. 
(a)  Appeal of board order to circuit court. In an appeal to review final orders of the board, the appellant shall file the original notice of appeal with the board clerk within 30 days of rendition of the order to be reviewed, and file a copy of the notice, accompanied by the filing fees prescribed by law, with the clerk of the court. The board clerk shall provide a copy of the notice of appeal to the code enforcement officer and the board attorney upon filing. Such an appeal shall proceed in accordance with the procedures provided by the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure for the review of final administrative action and shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the board. The code enforcement board, individual board members, magistrates, or code enforcement officers shall not be named as parties to such an appeal. 
(b)  Findings and action of board admissible. Unless the action of the board is overturned in an appellate proceeding held pursuant to this article, all findings and action of the board shall be admissible in any proceeding to collect unpaid penalties or costs, foreclose any lien, or compel the correction of any violation. 
(Ord. No. 2013-05, § 2, 1-22-2013) 
Sec. 2-308. - Reduction or forgiveness of code enforcement liens. 
    Where a certified copy of a code enforcement order has been recorded in the public records and has become a lien against the land or property of a property owner, such property owner may request a reduction or forgiveness of all or any portion of such lien as follows: 
(a)  Requests for lien reduction or forgiveness. The property owner requesting reduction or forgiveness of all or any portion of a code enforcement lien shall complete and file with the city clerk an application in the form provided by the city. The application shall include: 
(1)  Payment of a non-refundable application fee of $100.00 for processing the application; 
(2)  A copy of the recorded code enforcement order imposing civil penalties and/or costs; 
(3)  A copy of the code enforcement order finding the violation has been corrected and the subject property brought into compliance with the code; 
(4)  The factual circumstances upon which the property owner believes the application should be granted; 
(5)  The reasons, if any, compliance was not obtained prior to the order imposing civil penalties and/or costs being recorded; 
(6)  The amount of the lien reduction being sought; 
(7)  Any other information which the property owner deems pertinent to the request, including but not limited to the circumstances that exist which would warrant a reduction or forgiveness of all or any portion of the lien; and 
(8)  The sworn and notarized signature of the property owner. 
(b)  Application processing; review and recommendation by city manager. Upon receipt of an application for lien reduction or forgiveness, the city clerk shall forward the application and any supporting records to the city manager. The city manager shall review the application and supporting records and confirm that the subject property has been brought into compliance with all code provisions and remains in compliance. If the application is complete and the subject property is in compliance with the code, the city manager shall forward his recommendation to the city clerk regarding reduction of the amount of the lien, forgiveness of the full amount of the lien, or denial of the property owner's request in its entirety after consideration of the following factors: 
(1)  The nature of the violation; 
(2)  The severity of the violation; 
(3)  Whether the violation was a repeat violation of the same or a different code provision; 
(4)  The duration of the violation; 
(5)  The extent to which the property owner cooperated with the city in causing correction of the violations and bringing the property into compliance; 
(6)  Whether and the extent to which city funds or resources were expended to bring the property into compliance, including code enforcement costs; 
(7)  Whether the property owner purchased the subject property subsequent to recording of the code enforcement order and whether such lien should have been considered by the property owner prior to purchasing the property; 
(8)  Whether the city council or the code enforcement board or magistrate has previously reduced the amount of the lien under consideration either at the request of the current or a previous property owner; 
(9)  Whether there are any other unsatisfied code enforcement penalties or costs owed to the city by the property owner or code enforcement liens on other property owned by the property owner; 
(10)  Whether there are any other properties owned by the property owner that have uncorrected violations of any code provision; 
(11)  The accrued amount of the code enforcement lien as compared to the fair value of the subject property; 
(12)  Any financial hardship of the property owner; and 
(13)  Any additional mitigating circumstances which may warrant the reduction or forgiveness of all or a portion of the code enforcement lien. 
(c)  Presentation to city council. After receipt of the city manager's recommendation, the city clerk shall schedule the property owner's request for the next available city council meeting. The city clerk shall provide the property owner notice of the date and time of the city council meeting at which the request will be considered. 
(d)  City council action. Upon consideration of the information provided by the property owner, the recommendation of the city manager, and any other relevant documentation or statements as to the factors warranting lien reduction or forgiveness, the city council may reduce the amount of the lien, forgive the full amount of the lien, or deny the request in its entirety. The city council may attach any conditions to its decision which the city council finds appropriate in its discretion. 
(e)  Compliance with conditions. Failure of the property owner to comply with all conditions established by the city council in conjunction with the approval of a lien reduction or forgiveness shall result in the automatic denial of the request regardless of the city council's decision as to such lien reduction or forgiveness. 
(f)  Effect of denial of request. If the request for lien reduction or forgiveness is denied or if the request is automatically denied due to the failure of the property owner to comply with the conditions established by the city council, the property owner shall thereafter be barred from making a subsequent request for reduction or forgiveness of the subject lien for a period of one year from the date of the denial. During the one-year period the subject lien may only be satisfied and released upon payment of the full amount due. 
(g)  Satisfaction of lien. When the amount payable under a lien reduced or forgiven by the city council has been received by the city, the city attorney shall cause evidence of the satisfaction and discharge of such lien to be prepared and executed and thereafter duly recorded in the public records of each appropriate jurisdiction. The city manager is authorized to execute any such release and satisfaction on behalf of the city upon collection of such full amount. 
(h)  Nature of decision. Code enforcement liens are an asset of the city. Any action of the city council to reduce the amount of the lien, forgive the full amount of the lien, or deny the request in its entirety is strictly a discretionary decision and not a final administrative decision or order which is appealable.

The city council after review of bids received may award the contract to the bidder who, in the view of the city council, has submitted the bid that is in the overall best interest of the city.

Sec. 2-352. - Local preference in purchasing or contracting.

    Local business shall mean a business that meets all of the following criteria: 
(1)  Has had a staffed and fixed office or distribution point, with a verifiable street address, located within Indian River, Martin, or St. Lucie Counties for at least one full calendar year immediately prior to the issuance of the request for competitive bids or request for proposals by the city. Post office boxes shall not be used or considered for the purpose of establishing a physical address; and 
(2)  Has had, for at least 12 months immediately prior to the date of the advertisement for the particular good or service being solicited, a current "local business tax receipt" issued by the City of Vero Beach, Indian River, Martin, or St. Lucie Counties, if applicable; and 
(3)  Holds any license or competency card required by Indian River County, if applicable, and; 
(4)  If the contract is awarded, will be the person or entity in direct privity of contract with the City of Vero Beach and not as subcontractor, or any lower-tier subcontractor, material man, or supplier. 
    Non-local business means a bidder that is not a local business, as defined herein. 
(b)  Certification. Any person or entity claiming to be a local business, as defined herein, and desiring to receive local preference, shall complete and submit, together with all required attachments, a "local business certification form," in the form provided by the city and contained within the bid package accompanying a public notice/advertisement. Any bidder who fails to complete and submit the "local business certification form" together with all required attachments with the bid shall not be granted local preference consideration for the purposes of that specific contract award. The purchasing division shall determine if a person or entity meets the definition of a "local business." 
(c)  Local preference in purchases by means of formal competitive bid. In connection with any solicitation to which this section applies, local preference may be given to local businesses in the following manner: 
(1)  When a qualified and responsive, non-local business submits the lowest price bid (herein, "apparent low bidder"), and the bid submitted by one or more qualified and responsive local businesses is equal to or within five percent of the price submitted by the apparent low bidder, then the local business with the apparent next-lowest qualified and responsive bid offer (herein, the "lowest local bidder") shall have the opportunity to submit an offer to match the price(s) offered by the apparent low bidder as follows: 
a.  The purchasing division shall invite, in writing, by e-mail, fax, or certified mail, the lowest local bidder to submit a written matching offer to the purchasing division (herein "invitation"); 
b.  The lowest local bidder may, but shall not be obligated to, submit a written, faxed or e-mailed matching offer to the purchasing division within five business days after receipt of the invitation; 
c.  If the lowest local bidder submits a written offer that matches the bid from the apparent low bidder, such written offer shall be accepted and the lowest local bidder shall be awarded the contract; 
d.  If the lowest local bidder submits a written offer that does not match the bid from the apparent low bidder, such written offer shall be rejected; and 
e.  Thereupon, the next successive lowest qualified and responsive local bidder, if and only if its bid is less than or within five percent of the apparent low bidder, will receive the invitation. 
f.  This cycle shall be repeated until there are no remaining local bidders less than or within five percent, then the award shall be made to the apparent low bidder. 
(2)  If the lowest local bidder and successive next lowest local bidders do not respond, decline, or are unable to match the apparent low bidder bid price(s), then the award will be made to the apparent low bidder. 
(d)  Notice. All solicitations that are subject to this section shall include the substance of this local preference ordinance and the "local business certification form." 
(e)  Exclusions and limitations. 
(1)  Waiver of local preference. The application of this section to a particular purchase or contract of the City of Vero Beach may be waived only prior to bid solicitation/advertisement and with the approval of the city council. 
(2)  The provisions of this section shall not apply where prohibited by federal law or Florida law, or under the conditions of any grant or other funding source. 
(3)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to contracts under the Consultants Competitive Negotiation Act (CCNA), F.S. § 287.055, as CCNA allows consideration of location in the evaluative process. 
(4)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any procurement where the local nature of a business has been addressed through scoring criteria. 
(5)  The purchasing division shall be responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining administrative procedures in support of this policy. 
(f)  Subsequent review and sunset provision. On or about six months after the effective date of this ordinance [Ordinance No. 2010-15], the purchasing division will provide the city council with the results to date of this local preference policy and the status of regional reciprocity for Indian River County businesses by Martin and St. Lucie Counties. Within one year after the first bid awarded under this policy, the city council shall receive a similar report from the purchasing division and shall determine whether to continue or modify this policy. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city council from taking action sooner to revise or remove this local preference policy.

(Code 1982, § 7.07; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-408. - Accounts and records.

(Code 1982, § 7.08; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-409. - Self-insurance general fund; self-insurance reserve fund. 
    There are established in the self-insurance fund two funds, a self-insurance general fund and a reserve fund. The reserve fund shall be administered as provided in section 2-410. The self-insurance general fund shall be the operating and administrative fund, from which all costs and expenses of the program shall be paid except as specifically provided in section 2-410. All moneys received from participants and as earnings on investments shall remain therein until expended for administrative costs, transferred to the reserve fund pursuant to subsection 2-410(a)(1), or returned to a participant as provided in subsection 2-411(b). 
(Code 1982, § 7.09; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-410. - Reserve fund; two separate accounts. 
(a)  Separate accounts. There shall be created in the self-insurance fund one reserve fund with two separate accounts, which shall be maintained separately on the records of the reserve fund, as follows: 
(1)  There shall be an incurred loss reserve account, composed of amounts transferred from the self-insurance general fund as specific case loss reserves. Upon notice of an incident, accident, or occurrence which may give rise to a lawful claim or cause of action against a participant for a risk covered under the program, or upon legal notice, demand, suit, or other process in furtherance of such a claim or cause of action, a reasonable and prudent estimate of the ultimate cost or settlement value of such claim or cause of action, together with any anticipated claim expenses, shall be made in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the director. Such estimate, when approved by the director or his designee, shall be deemed to be an incurred loss and the amount thereof shall be transferred from the self-insurance general fund. Such reserve may be increased from time to time as may be required by prudent judgment or as may be indicated by claim development, but it may not be decreased, reduced, or released except for cause of action; provided, however, that a reserve for worker's compensation claims may be decreased from time to time as indicated by competent medical findings. No deduction shall be made from any amounts paid into the liability reserve for operation and administration of the program. 
(2)  There shall be a catastrophe contingency reserve account, composed of an amount computed as follows: At the end of each fiscal year, the director and director of finance shall ascertain for each participant in the program the excess of its pure loss provision over its aggregate loss retention and loss sharing. Such excess shall be paid into the catastrophe contingency reserve account for each participant until such reserve is equal to an amount not less than 50 percent nor more than 75 percent, as determined by the director, of the loss provision for that participant for that fiscal year; thereafter, any remaining excess shall be returned to the participant or shall be used to reduce its loss provision for the next fiscal year, as provided in section 2-411. No deduction shall be made from any amounts paid into the catastrophe contingency reserve account for operation and administration of the program. 
(b)  Administration. 
(1)  The incurred loss reserve account shall be used only to pay liquidated claims, settlements and final judgments arising out of the coverages provided by this article or added by the city, and for no other purpose. The funds in the incurred loss reserve account are not available to pay operating or administrative expenses of the program. Whenever a claim, settlement, or final judgment is paid out of the incurred loss reserve account, an appropriate receipt, release, or satisfaction shall be obtained; thereupon, any funds held in the incurred loss reserve that were originally transferred into the reserve but were not required to be paid out as a result of the liquidation of the claim or by the settlement or final judgment shall be discharged and released and such funds shall be transferred out of the incurred loss reserve account to the self-insurance general fund of the self-insurance fund. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the investment of funds in the incurred loss reserve account as provided in section 2-407. Within the incurred loss reserve account, the director shall maintain separate records for each participant. 
(2)  The catastrophe contingency reserve account shall be used to pay catastrophic losses arising out of the coverage provided by this article or added by the city, and for no other purpose. The funds in the catastrophe contingency reserve account are not available to pay operating or administrative expenses of the program. Within the catastrophe contingency reserve account, the director and director of finance shall maintain separate records for each participant. 
(Code 1982, § 7.10; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-411. - Loss provision. 
(a)  Annually, not later than July 1, the director shall determine for each participant: 
(1)  The excess loss threshold and retained risk maximum for the ensuing fiscal year; 
(2)  The loss provision to be made available for the ensuing fiscal year; and 
(3)  Whether the loss provision is to be paid into the self-insurance fund in one payment or in installments during the fiscal year and, if the latter, the frequency and amounts of the installment payments. The director shall use sound accounting and actuarial principles in arriving at the final payment determination; shall give due consideration to each participant's operations, payrolls and loss experience; and shall require a loss provision so that a participant will retain its risks to the maximum reasonable extent of its capacity to bear its separate risks. The loss provision payment shall be due on the dates specified by the director. 
(b)  The decision as to whether and to what extent an excess loss provision may be returned to the city or any participant to be used as a credit against the required loss provision shall be made by the city manager. 
(c)  Once received by the director of finance and paid into a participant's account in the self-insurance fund, the loss provision shall be applied as follows: The administrative costs to be shared by the participants shall be first deducted from the loss provision and the pure loss provision remaining shall be available for losses. 
(Code 1982, § 7.11; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-412. - Assessments. 
(a)  At the end of each fiscal year, and otherwise when determined by the director to be necessary, the loss experience of each participant shall be ascertained and the necessity for assessments determined. An assessment shall be made in order to maintain the integrity and the risk retention and risk-sharing scheme of the program, so that each participant is required to bear the risks apportionable to its operations. If the director determines that an assessment is necessary, he shall notify the city manager and he shall make all decisions relative to the assessment. 
(b)  Assessments shall be paid as follows: An assessment made because of a loss deficit caused by actual losses shall be due and payable as soon as the notice of the assessment is received by the participant. If the director determines that a lump-sum payment of the assessment would place an unreasonable burden upon the participant, they, with the city manager's concurrence, may permit the participant to pay the assessment in equal quarterly installments over a period not to exceed three fiscal years, including the current fiscal year. The deferred assessment shall bear interest at a rate equal to the interest rate on earnings of investments of the self-insurance fund at the time the assessment is made. 
(c)  In the event of losses of such magnitude as to be totally beyond the capacity of the self-insurance fund to defer and spread such losses to succeeding fiscal years, each participant shall be assessed an amount recommended by the director of finance, and confirmed by the city manager and city council, that will maintain this fund in a financially sound condition. Such assessment shall be due and payable not more than 60 days after the notice of the assessment. Under extraordinary conditions, the finance director is empowered to research other sources of financing, such as notes and bonds, and to recommend to council an alternative method of payment that will ensure the integrity of the self-insurance fund. 
(Code 1982, § 7.12; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-413. - Claims. 
(a)  Whenever there is a reasonable doubt or dispute as to liability or amount due on any claim arising from any of the risks covered by the program, the director, upon deeming it to be in the best interest of the program to settle the claim, shall have the authority to do so when the claim does not exceed the sum of $20,000.00 (but he may not settle any claims arising out of the same occurrence exceeding in the aggregate altogether $100,000.00), and to accept or give proper releases on behalf of the participant involved. The director is authorized to delegate to investigators on behalf of the program the authority to settle claims in the field (including the authority to accept and give releases on behalf of the participant involved), without the necessity of obtaining prior approval of the settlement, for not exceeding $20,000.00 for bodily injury per occurrence and $20,000.00 for property damage per occurrence. 
(b)  Whenever there is a reasonable doubt or dispute as to liability or amount due on any claim arising from any of the risks covered by the program, the city council, upon the written recommendation of the director of finance or his designee that he deems it to be in the best interest of the program to settle the claim, shall have the authority to do so when the claim exceeds $20,000.00 but does not exceed the sum of $100,000.00 (providing the claims arising out of the same occurrence altogether in the aggregate do not exceed $200,000.00), and to accept or give proper releases on behalf of the participant involved. 
(c)  The authority granted by this section shall be applicable only to claims arising out of the risks covered by this program. 
(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the director, with the concurrence of the city manager and the concurrence of the city attorney, is authorized to employ special counsel, from time to time, to perform legal services in connection with claims asserted against the self-insurance fund. The employment of special counsel, and the compensation to be paid thereto, shall be subject to the prior written concurrence of the director of finance or his designee, city attorney, and the city manager. Special counsel employed under the provisions of this subsection shall be paid from the self-insurance fund, as provided in subsection 2-406(1). 
(Code 1982, § 7.13; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-414. - Purchases of reinsurance and services. 
    The department is authorized to purchase specific excess insurance and aggregate excess insurance as necessary to provide the insurance coverages authorized by this article, to the extent that the loss exposure exceeds the reasonable capacity of the self-insurance fund to afford adequate direct coverage. The department is further authorized to purchase such insurance consultant and risk management services as may be required, and, to the extent that such services are purchased for the use of the program, no participant shall purchase such services out of its own appropriations. 
(Code 1982, § 7.14; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988)

The self-insurance fund is hereby declared to be a nondivisional and nondepartmental budgeted reserve fund, and the city manager's transfer power shall extend to the self-insurance fund only to the extent necessary to administer this article and the risk management program established in this article. 
(Code 1982, § 7.15; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-416. - Certain appropriations and expenditures prohibited. 
    No city department or agency shall request or include in any budget proposal any amounts for premiums to purchase insurance for the risks covered by this article or added by the city, nor expend any amounts from any funds appropriated to it to purchase such insurance; provided that this prohibition shall not apply to the department for the purchase of excess insurance pursuant to section 2-414. 
(Code 1982, § 7.16; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-417. - Additional risks. 
    Not oftener than annually, the director shall review the program and the safety and loss prevention activities and histories of the participants and may determine that risks can be assumed by the self-insurance fund in addition to the risks covered by section 2-401 and previously added by the city. With the approval of the city manager, the director may declare that the self-insurance fund will assume an additional designated risk as of a designated date and participation by all participants shall be mandatory unless exempted by the city manager and the city council. 
(Code 1982, § 7.17; Ord. No. 88-33, 9-20-1988) 
Sec. 2-418. - Reports on program. 
(a)  The city manager, through the director, shall submit to the council annually a formal report on his analysis of the program, which shall include: 
(1)  Underwriting information as to the nature of the risks accepted for self-insurance and those risks that are transferred to the insurance market; 
(2)  The funds appropriated or contributed to the self-insurance fund and premiums paid for insurance through the market; 
(3)  The costs of administration and operation of the risk management program; and 
(4)  Assessments made or loss provisions returned by the director during the reporting period. 
(b)  The department shall make available to the council a complete claims history including description of loss, claims, and reserves and the cost of all claims handled by the program.

(a)  Enforcement methods; remedies cumulative. The city may enforce and collect any unpaid lien as provided by law.

(b)  Judicial remedies; attorney's fees and costs. Upon approval of the city council, proceedings may be instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction for foreclosure on any lien established by the city. The prevailing party in any such action shall be entitled to recover all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in the action. In the event each party shall partially prevail in such action, costs and attorneys' fees shall be equitably apportioned between the parties by the court. 
(c)  Duration of liens; continuation. Each lien established by the city shall continue until paid or released or as otherwise provided by law. Any lien with a duration period limited by law may be extended by filing an action on the lien in a court of competent jurisdiction within such time period. The continuation of such lien resulting from commencement of an action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded in the public record books of the county. 
(d)  Satisfaction of liens; assignment. Any lien established by the city may be satisfied and discharged by paying to the city the amount specified in the lien plus any administrative fees and interest, if applicable, together with all applicable collection, legal, and administrative costs and expenses of the city, recording fees, and costs and fees to prepare and record a release and satisfaction of the lien in the public record books of the county. The amount payable to satisfy any lien may be reduced only as provided by law and with approval of the city council. Any person, firm, corporation or other legal entity, other than the owner of the property against whom the lien is effective, that pays any unsatisfied lien of the city shall be entitled to receive an assignment of the lien held by the city and shall be entitled to the rights of the city in respect to the enforcement and collection of such lien as permitted by law. When such third party fully pays all amounts due the city under the unsatisfied lien the city attorney shall prepare and the city manager may execute on behalf of the city an assignment of such lien. All other assignments shall require approval by the city council. The lien assignee shall be responsible and pay for recording in the appropriate public record books of the county the assignment of lien and any subsequent release and satisfaction of the lien. 
(e)  Use of collection agency. The city manager may, for the purpose of collecting any unpaid lien, contract with any debt collection agency or attorney doing business within or without this state for the collection of such lien as permitted by law. The costs of such collection, including any reasonable attorney's fee, paid or owed to any collection agency or attorney retained by the city, shall be added to the balance owed on the lien, in an amount not to exceed 40 percent of the amount due on the lien at the time the matter is referred for collection. The city may share confidential information with such collection agency or attorney necessary for the collection. 
(f)  Administrative action prohibited. Regardless of any other Code provision and unless deemed necessary for correction or abatement of a violation of any provision of this Code or state law or in order to avoid imminent peril to life or property, no officer, official, agent, employee or board of the city shall approve, grant or issue any operating permit, license, building permit, certificate of use or occupancy, variance, platting action, zoning action, or the like regarding or for any parcel of land or property subject of any unpaid and delinquent lien that is owed to the city. Appeal of any denial or refusal to act pursuant to this section shall be as provided in the general appeal provisions of this Code for appeal of an administrative decision.

    The intent of this division is to establish a citations process, in accordance with the requirements of F.S. § 489.127, which will help discourage substandard contracting practice within the city. 
(Code 1982, § 44.01; Ord. No. 92-18, § 1, 6-16-1992) 
Sec. 22-47. - Citations. 
(a)  A code inspector may issue a citation for any violation of F.S. § 489.127(1) or F.S. § 489.132(1), (relating to unlicensed, uncertified, or unregistered contractors), or for any violation of county code chapter 400, Regulation of Contractors, whenever, based upon personal investigation, the code inspector has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that such a violation has occurred. 
(b)  A contracting citation issued by a code inspector shall be in a form prescribed by the city and shall contain information as follows: 
(1)  The date and time of issuance. 
(2)  The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued. 
(3)  The date and time the civil infraction was committed. 
(4)  The facts constituting reasonable cause. 
(5)  The number of the section of the code or ordinance violated. 
(6)  The name and authority of the code enforcement officer. 
(7)  The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil penalty or to contest the citation. 
(8)  The applicable civil penalty if the person elects to contest the citation. 
(9)  The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
(Code 1982, § 44.02; Ord. No. 92-18, § 1, 6-16-1992) 
Sec. 22-48. - Penalties. 
    The city council shall adopt, by resolution, a schedule of penalties to be assessed by the code inspector for each prohibited contracting activity as set forth in F.S. § 489.127(1) and F.S. § 489.132(1), and chapter 400 of the county code. The maximum civil penalty which may be levied shall not exceed $500.00. Each day a willful, known violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Code 1982, § 44.03; Ord. No. 92-18, § 1, 6-16-1992) 
Sec. 22-49. - Cessation of violations; hearing procedures. 
(a)  Cessation of violation; election to correct and pay civil penalty or request hearing. The act for which the citation is issued shall be ceased upon receipt of the citation. The person charged with the violation shall elect either to correct the violation and pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the citation or, within ten days of receipt of the citation, exclusive of weekends and legal holidays, request an administrative hearing to appeal the issuance of the citation by the code inspector. The administrative hearing shall be held before the city code enforcement board or designated special master. Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a code inspector commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided for in F.S. §§ 775.082 or 775.083. 
(b)  Failure to appeal deemed waiver of right to administrative hearing. Failure of a violator to appeal the decision of the code inspector within the time period set forth in the subsection (a) of this section shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing. A waiver of the right to an administrative hearing shall be deemed an admission of the violation and penalties may be imposed accordingly. 
(c)  Dismissal of citation; "irreparable or irreversible" violations defined. If the person receiving the citation, or his designated representative, shows that the citation is invalid or that the violation has been corrected prior to appearing before the code enforcement board or designated special master, the code enforcement board or designated special master shall dismiss the citation unless, with the regard to a corrected violation, the violation is irreparable or irreversible. For purposes of this section, the violations termed "irreparable or irreversible" shall include, but not be limited to, violations that result in apparent financial advantage for the violator in comparison with law-abiding contractors. 
(d)  Civil penalty. If the code enforcement board or designated special master finds that a violation exists, the code enforcement board or designated special master may order the violator to pay a civil penalty of not less than the amount set forth on the citation but not more than $500.00 per day for each violation. In determining the amount of the penalty, the code enforcement board or designated special master shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation. 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation. 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(e)  Order to pay civil penalty. Upon written notification by the code inspector that a violator has not contested the citation or has not paid the civil penalty within the time frame allowed on the citation, or if a violation has not been corrected within the time frame set forth on the citation (as applicable), the code enforcement board or designated special master shall enter an order ordering the violator to pay the civil penalty set forth on the citation, and a hearing shall not be necessary for the issuance of such order. 
(f)  Record of penalty; constitution of lien. A certified copy of any order imposing penalty against an uncertified contractor may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against any real or personal property owned by the violator. The lien may be foreclosed upon after three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 487.127(5)(h). 
(Code 1982, § 44.04; Ord. No. 92-18, § 1, 6-16-1992) 
Sec. 22-50. - Appeal to circuit court. 
    An aggrieved party, including the local governing body, may appeal a final administrative order of the code enforcement board or designated special master to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the code enforcement board or designated special master. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
(Code 1982, § 44.05; Ord. No. 92-18, § 1, 6-16-1992) 
Sec. 22-51. - Notices. 
    All notices required by this division shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, return receipt requested; by hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer or code enforcement officer; by leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with some person of his family above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or by including a hearing date within the citation. 
(Code 1982, § 44.07; Ord. No. 92-18, § 1, 6-16-1992) 
Sec. 22-52. - Enforcement by other means. 
    Nothing contained in this division shall prohibit the city from enforcing its codes or ordinances by any other means.

ARTICLE IV. - COASTAL CONSTRUCTION CODE[9] 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Cross reference- Code enforcement, § 2-261 et seq. 

Sec. 22-241. - Title. 
    The provisions contained in this article shall constitute the coastal construction code for construction within the coastal building zone in the city and shall be referred to in this article as the "coastal code." 
(Code 1982, § 41.29; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-242. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the coastal code is to provide minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings and structures other than coastal protective structures, to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes and other natural disasters occurring along the coastal areas of the city. The coastal code is site specific to the coastal building zone as defined in this article and is not applicable to other locations. In the event of a conflict between this article and other articles or chapters of this Code, the requirements resulting in more restrictive design shall apply. No provisions in this article shall be construed to permit any construction in any area prohibited by local city, county, or state regulation. 
(Code 1982, § 41.30; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-243. - Applicability. 
    The requirements of this coastal code shall apply to the following types of construction in the coastal building zone in the city: 
(1)  The new construction of, or improvement to, major structures, nonhabitable major structures, and minor structures as defined in this article. Coastal protective structures such as seawalls or revetments are exempt from this article. 
(2)  The coastal code does not apply to minor work in the nature of normal beach cleaning or debris removal. 
(Code 1982, § 41.31; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-244. - Existing structures. 
    The requirements of this article shall not apply to existing structures, structures under construction, or structures for which a valid and unexpired building permit was issued prior to the adoption of the coastal code. 
(Code 1982, § 41.32; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-245. - Multizone structures. 
    For structures located partially in the coastal building zone, the requirements of the coastal code shall apply to the entire structure. 
(Code 1982, § 41.33; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-246. - Construction seaward of mean high water. 
    Structures or construction extending seaward of the mean high water line which are regulated by F.S. § 161.041 (e.g., groins, jetties, moles, breakwaters, seawalls, revetments, beach nourishment, inlet dredging, etc.), are specifically exempt from the provisions of this chapter. In addition, the coastal code does not apply to piers, pipelines, or outfalls which are regulated pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 161.053. 
(Code 1982, § 41.34; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-247. - Applications for permits. 
    Applications for building permits for all construction in the coastal building zone shall be certified by an architect or professional engineer registered in the state except single-family residences and accessory structures of normal or usual design as determined by the building official. Such certification shall state that the design plans and specifications for the construction are in compliance with the criteria established by this coastal code. 
(Code 1982, § 41.35; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-248. - Definitions. 
    The following terms are defined for general use in the coastal code: 
    Beach means the zone of unconsolidated material that extends landward from the mean low water line to the place where there is marked change in material or physiographic form, or to the line of permanent vegetation, usually the effective limit of storm waves. The term "beach" is alternatively termed "shore." 
    Breakaway building wall and frangible building wall mean a partition independent of supporting structural members that will withstand design wind forces, but will fail under hydrostatic, wave, and runup forces associated with the design storm surge. Under such conditions, the wall shall fail in a manner such that it breaks up into components that will minimize the potential for damage to life or adjacent property. 
    Building support structure means any structure which supports floor, wall or column loads, and transmits them to the foundation. The term shall include beams, grade beams, or joists, and includes the lowest horizontal structural member exclusive of piles, columns, or footings. 
    Coastal building zone means all of the land in the city east of the western bank of the Indian River as defined by the mean high water line. 
    Column action means the potential elastic instability in piles or columns resulting in axial or lateral bending of the member due to compressive stress. 
    Construction means the carrying out of any building, clearing, filling, or excavation or the substantial improvement in the size or use of any structure or the appearance of any land, other than coastal protective structures and beach fill/nourishment. When appropriate to the context, the term "construction" refers to the act of construction or the result of construction. 
    Design storm means the 100-year storm event including a storm surge equivalent to the base flood elevation as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Dune means a mound or ridge of loose sediments, usually sand-sized, lying landward of the beach, and deposited by natural or artificial means. 
    Major structure includes, but is not limited to, residential buildings including mobile homes, commercial, institutional, industrial, and other construction having the potential for substantial impact on coastal zones, other than coastal protective structures. 
    Mean high water line means the intersection of the tidal plane of mean high water with the shore. Mean high water is the average height of high waters over a 19-year period (see F.S. § 177.27(15)). 
    Minor structure means, but is not limited to, pile-supported, elevated dune and beach walkover structures; beach access ramps and walkways; stairways; pile-supported elevated viewing platforms, gazebos, and boardwalks; lifeguard support stands; public and private bathhouses; sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, handball courts, racquetball courts, and other uncovered paved areas; earth retaining walls; sand fences, privacy fences, ornamental walls, ornamental garden structures, aviaries, and other ornamental construction. It shall be a characteristic of minor structures that they are considered to be expendable under design wind, wave, and storm forces. 
    NGVD means National Geodetic Vertical Datum, a geodetic datum established by the National Ocean Service and frequently referred to as the 1929 Mean Sea Level Datum. 
    Nonhabitable major structure means, but is not limited to, swimming pools; parking garages; canals, lakes, ditches; water and sewage treatment plants; electrical power plants; transmission and distribution lines, transformer pads, vaults, and substations; roads, bridges, streets, and highways; underground storage tanks; communications buildings and towers; flagpoles and signs over 15 feet in height. 
    Substantial improvements means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds a cumulative total of 50 percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places. 
(Code 1982, § 41.36; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986; Ord. No. 86-28, § 2, 9-16-1986) 
Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction, § 1-2. 
Sec. 22-249. - Coastal construction requirements. 
    Construction within the coastal building zone shall meet the requirements of this chapter. All structures shall be designed so as to minimize damage to life, property, and the natural environment. Assistance in determining the design parameters to minimize such damage may be found in reference documents listed in section 22-255. 
(Code 1982, § 41.37; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-250. - Structural requirements for major structures. 
(a)  Foundations. 
(1)  All major structures shall be anchored to their foundation in such a manner as to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral displacement. 
(2)  Foundation design and construction of a major structure shall consider all anticipated loads resulting from a 100-year storm event, including wave, hydrostatic, and hydrodynamic loads acting simultaneously with live and dead loads. Erosion computations for foundation design shall account for all vertical and lateral erosion and scour-producing forces, including localized scour due to the presence of structural components. Foundation design and construction shall provide for adequate bearing capacity taking into consideration the anticipated loss of soil above the design grade as a result of localized scour. The erosion computations required by this subsection do not apply landward of coastal construction lines. Upon request, the state department of environmental protection may provide information and guidance as to those areas within the coastal building zone where the erosion and scour of a 100-year storm event is applicable. 
(3)  Nothing in this article shall prohibit the use of slab-on-grade foundation systems for areas where the natural grade is wholly at, or above, base flood elevation (X zones) and built in conformance with applicable requirements of this Code. 
(b)  Understructures. No substantial walls or partitions shall be constructed below the level of the first finished floor. This does not preclude the construction of: 
(1)  Stairways; 
(2)  Shearwalls essentially perpendicular to breaking waves; 
(3)  Shearwalls essentially parallel to breaking waves which do not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the building length; 
(4)  Wind or sand screens constructed of fabric or wire mesh; 
(5)  Light open lattice partitions with individual wooden lattice strips no greater than three-quarter-inch thick or three inches wide; 
(6)  Elevator shafts; 
(7)  Breakaway or frangible building walls; or 
(8)  Substantial building walls constructed above the wave action and storm surge expected under design storm conditions. 
(c)  Building and floor elevations. The minimum elevation for the underside of the building support structure, excluding foundation, shall be above the elevation of the design breaking wave crests or wave uprush superimposed on the storm surge with dynamic wave setup expected under design storm conditions. The elevation of the storm surge with dynamic wave setup shall be the elevation established by the base flood elevation for the specific area as established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(d)  Erosion and design grade. The elevation of the soil surface to be used in the design of foundations, calculation of pile reactions, and bearing capacities shall not be greater than that which would result from the erosion reasonably anticipated as a result of design storm conditions. Calculation of the design grade shall take into account localized scour due to the presence of structural components. Erosion computations for foundation design shall consider all vertical and lateral erosion and scour-producing forces. 
(e)  Wave force design. 
(1)  Calculations for wave forces resulting from design storm conditions on building foundations and superstructures may be based upon the minimum criteria and methods prescribed in the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Design Manual, NAVFAC DM-26, U.S. Department of Navy; Shore Protection Manual, U.S. Department of the Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Department of the Army Coastal Engineering Research Center Technical Papers and Reports; the Technical and Design Memoranda of the Division of Beaches and Shores, Florida Department of Environmental Protection; or other professionally recognized methodologies which produce equivalent design criteria. 
(2)  Breaking, broken, and nonbreaking waves shall be considered as they may be applicable. Design wave loading analysis shall consider vertical uplift pressures and all lateral pressures to include impact as well as dynamic loading and the harmonic intensification resulting from repetitive waves. 
(f)  Hydrostatic loads. Calculations for hydrostatic loads shall consider the maximum water pressure resulting from a fully peaked, breaking wave superimposed upon the design storm surge with dynamic wave setup. Both free and hydrostatic loads shall be considered. Hydrostatic loads which are confined shall be determined using the maximum elevation to which the confined water would freely rise if unconfined. Vertical hydrostatic loads shall be considered both vertically downward and upward on horizontal or inclined surfaces of major structures (e.g. floors, slabs, roofs, walls). Lateral hydrostatic loads shall be considered as forces acting horizontally above and below grade on vertical or inclined surfaces. Hydrostatic loads on irregular or curved geometric surfaces shall be determined by considering the separate vertical and horizontal components acting simultaneously under the distribution of the hydrostatic pressures. 
(g)  Hydrodynamic loads. Hydrodynamic loads shall consider the maximum water pressures resulting from the motion of the water mass associated with the design storm. Full intensity loading shall be applied on all structural surfaces above the design grade which would affect the flow velocities. 
(h)  Design conditions generally. 
(1)  Foundations for all major structures shall be designed for the horizontal and vertical pressures generated by wave forces between the elevation of the design breaking wave crests or wave uprush superimposed upon the storm surge and the stable soil elevation of the site. 
(2)  All major structures shall be designed to withstand 110-mile-per-hour windspeeds in accordance with the Standard Building Code. 
(3)  Appropriate shape factors shall be applied for resistance against overturning and uplift as required elsewhere in this Code. Internal pressures on internal walls, ceilings, and floors resulting from damaged windows or doors shall also be considered in the design unless the specified windows and doors have been tested by an approved testing agency and have been shown to be capable of withstanding the design pressures required in this subsection. 
(Code 1982, § 41.38; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986; Ord. No. 86-28, § 3, 9-16-1986; Ord. No. 87-54, § 1, 8-18-1987; Ord. No. 93-30, § 4, 11-2-1993) 
Sec. 22-251. - Structural requirements for nonhabitable major structures. 
    Nonhabitable major structures need not meet the specific structural requirements of section 22-250, except that they shall be designed to produce the minimum adverse impact on the beach and dune system and shall comply with the applicable standards of construction found elsewhere in this code. All sewage treatment and public water supply systems shall be floodproofed to prevent infiltration of surface water anticipated under design storm conditions. Underground utilities, excluding pad transformers and vaults, shall be floodproofed to prevent infiltration of surface water expected under design storm conditions or shall otherwise be designed to function when submerged under such storm conditions. 
(Code 1982, § 41.39; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-252. - Structural requirements for minor structures. 
    Minor structures need not meet the specific structural requirements of section 22-250, except that they shall be designed to produce the minimum adverse impact on the beach and dune system and shall comply with the applicable standards of construction found elsewhere in this Code. 
(Code 1982, § 41.40; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-253. - Location of construction. 
    Construction, except for elevated walkways, lifeguard support stands, piers, beach access ramps, gazebos, etc., shall be located a sufficient distance landward of the beach to permit natural shoreline fluctuations and to preserve dune stability. Construction, including excavation, may occur to the extent that the natural storm buffering and protection capability of the dune is not diminished. 
(Code 1982, § 41.41; Ord. No. 86-05, § 1, 2-18-1986) 
Sec. 22-254. - Public access. 
    Where the public has established an accessway through private lands to lands seaward of the mean high tide or water line by prescription, prescriptive easement, or any other legal means, development or construction shall not interfere with such right of access unless a comparable alternative accessway is provided. The developer shall have a right to improve, consolidate, or relocate such public accessways so long as they are: 
(1)  Of substantially similar quality and convenience to the public; 
(2)  Approved by the local government and whenever improvements are involved seaward of the coastal construction control line the additional approval of the state department of natural resources is required; and 
(3)  Consistent with the coastal management element of the local comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to F.S. § 163.3178.

(c)  Sale by city clerk . Cemetery lots, burial spaces, and columbarium burial rights may be purchased during regular city hall office hours at the city clerk's office. In addition, provision has been made with funeral homes located in the city to provide access to and reservation of certain limited burial lots during off-duty hours. A cemetery plat shall be maintained by the city which shall delineate the burial spaces, lots, and plots, and the type of burials permitted. A diagram of each columbarium shall be maintained indicating the location of each single and family niche. 
(d)  City resident/city property owner price . A purchaser providing proof of eligibility acceptable to the city clerk for a city resident/city property owner price may purchase a cemetery lot, burial space, or columbarium burial rights at such price. Eligibility for a city resident or city property owner price shall be determined by the city clerk at the time of purchase as follows: 
(1)  The purchaser is a city resident or city property owner, as defined in this chapter, at the time of the purchase; or 
(2)  The purchase is being made for the burial or interment of a decedent that was a city resident or city property owner, as defined in this chapter, at the date of death. 
Regular prices shall otherwise apply. There shall be no partial refund or proration of any price difference when or if a purchaser that did not qualify for a city resident or city property owner price at the time of purchase subsequently becomes a city resident or city property owner.

The remainder of all such revenue shall be deposited in the Crestlawn Cemetery Trust Fund. If 50 percent of the revenue is insufficient in any fiscal year to meet operating expenses, a greater amount of the revenue may be used for operating purposes with a corresponding decrease in funding going to the trust fund. 
(2)  The Crestlawn Cemetery Trust Fund shall be used for capital expansion or improvement of the cemetery and any surplus funds shall be invested in accordance with general law governing municipal investments. Any income derived from fund investments shall be used solely for capital improvements, operation, care, or maintenance of Crestlawn Cemetery. 
(f)  Reconveyance of lots and columbarium burial rights to city . Any owner of a cemetery lot, burial space, or columbarium burial rights may reconvey such lot, burial space, or columbarium burial rights to the city, if the city, at its sole discretion, determines that the lot, burial space, or burial rights in the columbarium niche are resalable and in accordance with this chapter. If a burial has been made on the lot or space, or interment made in the columbarium niche, the body or cremains must be disinterred and all markers, coffins, urns, and other containers must be removed at the expense of the owner or other authorized person making the request before the city may accept the reconveyance. In the case of columbarium burial rights, the owner or other authorized person making the request shall also pay the expense for installation of new niche covers if they require replacement, as determined solely by the city. The original purchase price or the current purchase price at the time of reconveyance, whichever is less, less any unpaid cemetery expenses or fees due the city, shall be paid by the city from the Crestlawn Cemetery Trust Fund to the owner or other authorized person reconveying the cemetery lot, burial space, or columbarium burial rights accepted by the city.

ARTICLE V. - FLORIDA-FRIENDLY FERTILIZER USE 

Sec. 38-101. - Purpose and intent. 
    This article regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; establishes training and permitting requirements; establishes a prohibited application period; specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods, fertilizer-free zones, low maintenance zones, and exemptions. This article requires the use of best management practices which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers. These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on the city's natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, canals, estuaries, creeks, and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of the city residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality. 
(Ord. No. 2012-01, § 2, 1-3-2012)

If a permittee in good standing fails to give such notice and vacates the assigned dock or mooring space for 15 days, the assigned space shall be deemed to be abandoned and the permit revoked. If a permittee, who is in arrears of space or utility fees and whose security deposit is insufficient to cover the arrearage, fails to give notice of absence and vacates the assigned space, the assigned dock space shall be deemed to be abandoned and the permit revoked. 
(c)  Unattended vessels in the MAMF. When a vessel in the MAMF has been unoccupied for 72 hours without attention by the owner, captain, or knowledgeable local personnel as to the seaworthiness of the vessel, and/or the applicable mooring fees are more than one month overdue, the vessel shall be considered to be abandoned. The harbormaster shall place a notice on the vessel and attempt to contact, in the most expeditious manner, the local representative, and, if failing to do so, shall then attempt to contact the owner/captain by telephone, and then, if failing to do so, by registered mail.

DIVISION 3. - FIREFIGHTER RELIEF AND PENSION FUND 

Sec. 58-71. - Established. 
    The firefighter's relief and pension fund of the city is established and shall be secured by all sources provided in F.S. ch. 175, and such other monies as appropriated by the city to maintain the actuarial soundness of the fund. The firefighter's relief and pension fund is closed to any new participants and is a carry-over for those persons previously employed by the city who elected to remain in this plan rather than transfer to the state retirement system when the city fire department was transferred to the South Indian River County Fire District. The active firefighter seats on the board of trustees may be held by either an active firefighter who is a member of the plan or a retired firefighter who shall be elected by the active members of the plan. Whenever the active membership of firefighters shall fall below ten, the active firefighter seat may be held by either an active firefighter or a retired firefighter who is a member of the plan and who shall be elected by the retirees and active firefighter membership of the plan. If there are no active or retired members remaining in the plan or capable of serving, the remaining board members may select an individual to serve in the active member seat.

Sec. 58-78. - Investment of funds. 
(a)  Objective. It shall be the objective of the municipal firefighter's relief and pension fund that it be managed, administered, operated, and funded in such a manner as to maximize the protection of the fund. In pursuit of this objective, the assets of the fund will be invested primarily in publicly traded instruments of investment grade or higher, as described in F.S. § 175.071. Consistent with this objective is the mandate that the fund will be capable of providing retirement benefits to participants in accordance with the plan benefits as stated in F.S. ch. 175 and this Code. 
(b)  Investment guidelines. The board's investments shall be governed by the investment policy statement and guidelines, which may be periodically reviewed by the board. The board shall have the authority to invest in all lawful investments, as permitted by F.S. ch. 175 and § 215.47. 
(c)  Investment policy statement to be filed with city clerk by fire pension board. The fire pension board shall file a copy of its statement of investment policy relative to the firefighters' pension plan with the city clerk. In the event that the fire pension board amends its state of investment policy, the fire pension board shall file an amended copy of its statement of investment policy with the city clerk. The fire pension board's statement of investment policy shall complement the investment guidelines provided in all applicable state law and local ordinances. 
(d)  Statement of investment policy for the municipal firefighters' pension plan. 
(1)  Introduction. The Board of Trustees of the City of Vero Beach Municipal Firefighters' Pension Plan has established this statement of investment policy. This policy has been identified by the board as having the greatest expected investment return, and the resulting positive impact on asset values, funded status and benefits, without exceeding a prudent level of risk. The board determined this policy after evaluating the implications of increased investment return versus increased variability of return for a number of potential investment policies with varying commitments to stocks and bonds. 
This statement of investment policy is intended to compliment the investment guidelines provided in all applicable state statutes and local ordinances. The purpose of this statement is to: 
a.  Provide the investment manager a more accurate understanding of the trustees' investment objectives and, 
b.  Indicate the criteria by which the investment manager's performance will be evaluated. 
(2)  General objectives. The primary investment objective of the City of Vero Beach Municipal Firefighters' Pension Plan is the preservation of invested capital. The secondary objective is to achieve moderate long-term real growth of the assets while minimizing the volatility of returns. 
To achieve these objectives, the board seeks to create a conservative, well diversified and balanced portfolio of high quality equity, fixed income and money market securities. The board has determined that one or more outside investment managers shall be retained to assure that all investments are managed in both a prudent and professional manner and in compliance with the stated investment guidelines. 
(3)  Investment manager responsibilities. 
a.  Within the guidelines and restrictions set forth herein, it is the intention of the board to give the investment manager full investment discretion, with respect to assets under its management. The investment manager shall discharge its responsibilities in the same manner as it would if the fund were governed by the fiduciary responsibility provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Although the fund trustees acknowledge that ERISA does not apply to a governmental fund, it hereby imposes the fiduciary provisions of ERISA upon the investment manager whose performance shall conform to the statutory provisions, rules, regulations, interpretations and case law of ERISA. The investment manager shall acknowledge, in writing, that it is a named fiduciary of the fund. 
b.  The investment manager is expected to provide any reasonable information requested by the board of trustees. At a minimum, each manager shall provide a quarterly report detailing their investment activity, the portfolio's current value, and any changes in investment philosophy or strategy. The firm's investment manager is expected to meet with the board of trustees at least once per year. A designated representative will meet with the board of trustees, as requested. 
c.  Unless otherwise provided by the custodian, the investment manager will monitor portfolio activity to minimize unvested cash balances. 
d.  The investment manager shall be responsible only for those assets under its management. 
e.  It will be the responsibility of the investment manager to review the monthly valuations provided by the custodian and to note, in writing, any significant discrepancies from the valuations provided in their own reports. 
(4)  Investment objectives. Investment objectives are intended to provide quantifiable benchmarks to measure and evaluate portfolio return and risk. Most investment styles require a full market cycle to allow an investment manager to demonstrate his abilities. A full market cycle is generally defined as a three- to five-year time period. As a result, performance objectives will be measured over three- to five-year periods. Monitoring shorter periods may be used to determine the trend of performance premiums or deficiencies. 
The specific investment objectives of the municipal firefighters' pension plan are as follows: 
Primary objective: To earn an average rate of return over the long term (three to five years) which exceeds the return of a target index. The target index for the municipal firefighters' pension plan shall be set forth in the board's investment statement and guidelines. 
In addition, it is expected that the total rate of return earned by the fund and the returns earned by the stock and bond portions of the portfolio will each rank above average when compared to a representative universe of other, similarly managed portfolios. 
Secondary objectives: A further goal of the municipal firefighters' pension plan shall be to achieve an average annual rate of return greater than eight percent, over the longer term. This absolute return objective will be evaluated in the context of the prevailing investment market conditions. 
Volatility: The volatility of the fund's total returns is expected to be similar to that of the target index and will be evaluated accordingly. 
The above investment objectives have been established for the entire municipal firefighters' pension plan. The specific investment objectives for each investment manager will be outlined in addenda to this overall statement of investment policy. 
(5)  Investment guidelines. In accordance with F.S. ch. 175, and the policies established by the board of trustees, the assets of the municipal firefighters' pension plan shall be invested in a diversified portfolio of fully negotiable, equity, fixed income, and money market securities, as set forth in the board's investment policy statement and guidelines. 
(6)  Review of policy. It is the intention of the Board of Trustees of the City of Vero Beach Municipal Firefighters' Pension Plan to review this statement of investment policy and its addenda periodically to amend it to reflect any changes in philosophy or objectives. However, if at any time the investment manager believes that the specific objectives defined herein cannot be met or that these guidelines unnecessarily constrict performance, the board shall be so notified in writing.

Sec. 58-79. - Limitation on benefits, required distributions, and plan termination. 
(a)  Limitation on benefits: 
(1)  Basic limitation : Notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the plan shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this plan. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(2)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit: 
a.  If the form of benefit without regard to any benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the Code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date is reduced to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
b.  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
1.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
2.  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code section 415(b)(1). 
c.  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
1.  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first calendar year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
2.  Thereafter, in any subsequent calendar year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
3.  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the plan in any calendar year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
d.  Unless otherwise specified in the plan, for purposes of applying the limits under Code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
e.  Other adjustments in limitations: 
1.  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
2.  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time police officer or firefighter, the adjustments provided for in subsection (D)(1) above shall not apply. 
3.  The reductions provided for in subsection (D)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
4.  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (A) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the treasury or his/her delegate. 
(3)  Less than ten years of service: The maximum retirement benefit payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of credited service shall be the amount determined under subsection (a)(1) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator or which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
(4)  Participation in other defined benefit plans : The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code section 414(j) maintained by the employer shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all employer defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(5)  Ten thousand dollar limit : Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this plan and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the employer contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the employer has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(6)  Reduction of benefits : Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures to defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(7)  Additional limitation on pension benefits: 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
a.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a participant of the plan and who has not previously participated in such plan, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
b.  No participant shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the participant is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(b)  Required distributions. 
(1)  In no event may a participant's retirement benefit be delayed beyond the later of the April 1 following the calendar year in which he attains age 701/2 or April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which he retires. 
(2)  When the distribution of the participant's entire interest is not made in a lump sum, the distribution will be made in one or more of the following ways: over the life of the participant; over the life of the participant and designated beneficiary; over a period certain not extending beyond the life expectancy of the participant; or over a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and a designated beneficiary. 
(3)  If distribution has commenced before the participant's death, the remaining interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of the participant's death. 
(4)  The method of distribution, if the participant dies before distributions commence, must satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  Any remaining portion of the participant's interest that is not payable to a beneficiary designated by the participant will be distributed within five years after the participant's death; and 
b.  Any portion of the participant's interest that is payable to a beneficiary designated by the participant will be distributed either (i) within five years after the participant's death, or (ii) over the life of the beneficiary or over a period certain not extending beyond the life expectancy of the beneficiary, commencing not later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant died (or, if the designated beneficiary is the participant's surviving spouse, commencing not later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2). 
(5)  The plan shall operate in accordance with the requirements of the regulations under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirements of section 1.401(a)(9)-2 of the proposed regulations. 
(c)  Repeal or termination of fund. In the event of the termination or partial termination of this plan, each affected participant's accrued pension benefit shall become nonforfeitable, i.e., 100 percent vested, to the extent funded. At such time, the fund shall be appropriated and distributed in accordance with F.S. ch. 175. The plan shall remain in effect until the final benefit payment has been made to the last participant or beneficiary and shall then be terminated in accordance with F.S. § 175.361. 
(d)  Actuarial equivalence. The terms "actuarial equivalence" and "actuarially equivalent" shall mean that any benefit payable under the terms of this plan in a form other than the normal form of benefit shall have the same actuarial present value of any form of payment, all future payments shall be discounted for interest and mortality by using seven percent interest and the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table for Males, with ages set ahead five years in the case of disability retirees. 
(e)  Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provisions of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions: 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in section 4301(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. 
d.  Direct rollover A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

Sec. 58-80. - Ad-hoc thirteenth check. 
(a)  Benefit created. A benefit is hereby created to be provided in the form of an ad-hoc thirteenth check to be paid on June 1 to each beneficiary and retiree of the plan in pay status as of September 30 of the prior year. Payment shall only be made in those years in which a cumulative net actuarial gain has been determined to exist by the board of trustees, as certified in writing by the actuary to the board. 
(b)  Determination of actuarial gains. The actuary shall perform an annual calculation to determine whether or not the plan has sustained an actuarial gain or loss and whether the plan's net cumulative actuarial experience supports a distribution consistent with the requirements of F.S. § 112.61. The board shall be required to utilize five-year asset smoothing, whereby capital appreciation shall be recognized at the rate of 20 percent per year. Thirteenth check distributions shall be dependent upon the amount of cumulative net actuarial gains determined to exist in the System and shall not result in an increase in the liability of the City of Vero Beach. Ad-hoc thirteenth check distributions shall not exceed $25,000.00 in any year, for any retiree or beneficiary. The $25,000.00 cap shall be adjusted annually, up or down, based on the Consumer Price Index, as determined by the board's actuary. 
(c)  Distribution of benefits; limitations. Once certified by the actuary, the board shall notify retirees and beneficiaries, in pay status as of September 30 of the prior year, regarding the availability of an ad-hoc thirteenth check distribution for the current year. In any year in which the board of trustees, following consultation with the actuary, determines that no actuarial gain has occurred, no benefit shall be payable. In years in which the plan's net cumulative actuarial experience is sufficient to support the payment of an ad-hoc thirteenth check, the payment shall be made on June 1 on a per capita non-discriminatory basis. 
(d)  Non-guarantee of benefits. By acceptance of an ad-hoc thirteenth check distribution under this section, each retiree and beneficiary acknowledges that they have no right, title or interest in any such benefits except as may be determined by the board of trustees, as set forth in this section. The payment of an ad-hoc thirteenth check in any year shall not create any right, title or interest in any person to the payment of an ad-hoc thirteenth check in any other year. The board of trustees reserves the exclusive right to alter the manner of payment of this benefit or, to decline the payment of such benefit in any year in which the board, in the exercise of its fiduciary responsibility and its sole discretion, determines it is in the best interest of the plan to forego such payment. 
(e)  Commission approval. No benefits shall be paid under this section until approved by ordinance or resolution of the city commission, which shall be adopted as a ministerial act upon presentation of the written actuarial certification required by subsection (a) herein. 
(f)  Rule-making authority. The board of trustees shall have authority to make such uniform rules as it deems appropriate to facilitate the payment of benefits under this section.

Sec. 58-81. - Share plan. 
(a)  Share plan established. The Vero Beach Firefighter's Share Plan (hereinafter "share plan") is hereby established. The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of F.S. ch. 175, and to provide a mechanism to pay required "special benefits" pursuant to F.S. § 175.351. The share plan shall be funded exclusively with available insurance premium tax revenue received from the State of Florida pursuant to F.S. ch. 175 and shall be in addition to the monthly defined benefit payable by the City of Vero Beach Firefighter's Relief and Pension Fund. The share plan shall be administered by the board of trustees of the City of Vero Beach Firefighter's Relief and Pension Fund (hereinafter the "pension fund"). 
(b)  Annual determination. In each year, after receipt of the annual distribution of chapter money from the state, the board of trustees, in consultation with their actuary, shall determine the amount of available insurance premium tax revenue, if any, received pursuant to F.S. § 175.351. Insurance premium tax revenue is not available for payment into the share plan unless the annual insurance premium tax distribution exceeds $306,972.00 (hereinafter the "special benefit threshold"). If the annual insurance premium tax distribution exceeds the special benefit threshold, half of the sum above $306,972.00 shall be paid into the share plan for distribution pro- rata as set forth below in subsection (c). 
(c)  Pro-rata distribution. Share plan benefits shall be paid from the share plan on a pro-rata basis to all retirees or beneficiaries who are receiving a monthly benefit from the Vero Beach Firefighter's Relief and Pension Fund. Share plan benefits shall be distributed as soon as is administratively practicable, after the actuary for the Vero Beach Firefighter's Relief and Pension Fund has certified the distribution amounts for the year, if any, in consultation with the City of Vero Beach. 
(d)  Rule-making authority. The board of trustees of the Vero Beach Firefighter's Relief and Pension Fund shall be authorized to adopt any rules necessary for the administration of the share plan.

Sec. 58-99. - Administration of fund. 
(a)  The fund shall be administered and payment made therefrom as provided by F.S. ch. 185; provided, however, that the amount of monthly retirement income payable to a police officer who retires on or after his normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of his years of credited service multiplied by three percent of his average final compensation. The average final compensation shall be based on the best five years of employment and disability benefits shall be based on benefits accrued to date of disability with a minimum of 50 percent of the final average compensation; provided further, that there shall be no eligibility restrictions period for in-line-of-duty disabilities. 
(b)  There is hereby created a Board of Trustees of the City of Vero Beach Police Officers' Retirement Fund, which shall be solely responsible for administering the trust fund. The membership of the board of trustees shall consist of five members, two of whom, unless otherwise prohibited by law, shall be legal residents of the City of Vero Beach, who shall be appointed by the city council, and two of whom shall be police officer members of this fund (either or both of whom may be deferred retirement option plan ["DROP"] participants pursuant to division 5 of this article II) elected by a majority of the active police officers who are members of this fund. The fifth member shall be chosen by a majority of the previous four members, and such person's name shall be submitted to the city council and shall, as a ministerial duty, be appointed to the board of trustees. The fifth member shall have the same rights as each of the other four members appointed or elected as herein provided, shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, and may succeed himself or herself in office. Each resident member shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, unless sooner replaced by the city council at whose pleasure the member shall serve, and may succeed himself or herself as a trustee. Each police officer member shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, unless he or she sooner leaves the employment of the municipality as a police officer, whereupon a successor shall be elected in the same manner as an original appointment. Each police officer may succeed himself or herself in office. 
(c)  The board of trustees may, upon written request by a retiree of the fund, or by the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for benefits being received through the city, the certified bargaining agent, alimony, child support or medical payments to a former spouse or minor child, and to pay for accident, health, and long-term care insurance premiums for the recipient, the recipient's spouse and the recipient's dependents. The pension fund shall not incur any liability for making or failing to make such withholdings. 
(d)  Vesting of benefits upon termination of the plan. Any provision of this plan to the contrary notwithstanding, a member's accrued benefit shall become 100 percent vested upon termination of the plan.

Sec. 58-100. - Death benefit prior to retirement. 
    In the event of the death of a police officer prior to retirement, and after he has been a member of the fund for one year, if death occurred other than in line of duty, the police officer's beneficiary shall be entitled to benefits as provided in F.S. § 185.21. If such death occurred in line of duty, there shall be no probationary period, regardless of length of service. Provided further, however, that such benefit shall not be less than one-fourth (25 percent) of the police officer's final average earnings. If the deceased police officer has no dependent spouse, dependent children or other beneficiaries, his contributions shall be paid to his estate. In the case of a member who dies on or after January 1, 2007 while performing "qualified military service" under Title 38, United States Code, Chapter 43, Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act ("USERRA") within the meaning of section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code, any "additional benefits" (as defined by section 401(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code) provided under the plan that are contingent upon a member's termination of employment due to death shall be determined as though the member had resumed employment immediately prior to his death. With respect to any such "additional benefits," for vesting purposes only, credit shall be given for the period of the member's absence from covered employment during "qualified military service."

Provided, however, that should the officer continue in service beyond the date just described, he shall continue to contribute to the fund and receive credit for service up to the date he actually retires. Provided further, however, if a police officer elects an early retirement, the reduction in annuity for age will be calculated at a rate of 21/2 percent per year from the early retirement date to the date the member would have reached normal retirement had he not terminated employment. Any provision of this plan to the contrary notwithstanding, a member's accrued benefit shall become 100 percent vested upon the attainment of the normal retirement date. 
(b)  Optional forms of retirement income. In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified in (a), a police officer, upon written request to the board of trustees and subject to the approval of the board of trustees, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income payable to the police officer for his or her lifetime only.

Sec. 58-103. - Actuarial equivalence and actuarially equivalent defined. 
    The terms "actuarial equivalence" and "actuarially equivalent" shall mean that any benefit payable under the terms of this system in a form other than the normal form of benefit shall have the same actuarial present value, excluding cost of living adjustment, on the date payment commences as the normal form of benefit. For purposes of establishing the actuarial present value of any form of payment, other than a lump sum distribution, all future payments shall be discounted for interest and mortality by using seven percent interest and the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table for Males, with ages set ahead five years in the case of disability retirees. In the case of a lump sum distribution, the actuarial present value shall be determined on the basis of the same mortality rates as just described and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's interest rates for terminating single employer plans, which rates are in effect 90 days prior to the member's date of termination, or 90 days prior to the distribution date if distribution is made later than six months after the member's date of termination; provided, however, the application of this definition of actuarial equivalences shall not have the effect of altering or reducing the amount of the disability benefit described in this division, nor the method used to calculate benefits payable at early retirement which shall be the method described in F.S. § 185.16(4)(b).

Sec. 58-104. - Internal Revenue Code compliance. 
(a)  Maximum amount of retirement income: 
(1)  The limitations of this subsection (a) shall apply in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein, and are intended to comply with the requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and shall be construed in accordance with said Act and guidance issued thereunder. The provisions of this subsection (a) shall supersede any provision of the plan to the extent such provision is inconsistent with this subsection. 
The annual pension as defined in paragraph (2) below otherwise payable to a member at any time shall not exceed the dollar limitation for the member multiplied by a fraction whose value cannot exceed one, the numerator of which is the member's number of years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of service with the city and the denominator of which is 10. For this purpose, no more than one year of service may be credited for any plan year. If the benefit the member would otherwise accrue in a limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the benefit shall be limited (or the rate of accrual reduced) to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation. 
(2)  "Annual pension" means the sum of all annual benefits, payable in the form of a straight life annuity. Benefits payable in any other form shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
a.  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007: 
(I)  the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the member's form of benefit; or 
(II)  the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
b.  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007: 
(I)  the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan for the particular form of payment; or 
(II)  the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this subsection (a), and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any limitation year shall not exceed the limits of this subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to section 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
(3)  "Dollar limitation" means, effective for the first limitation year beginning after January 1, 2001, $160,000.00, automatically adjusted under Code section 415(d), effective January 1 of each year, as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. The new limitation shall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment, but a member's benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that calendar year. The dollar limitation shall be further adjusted based on the age of the member when the benefit begins as follows: 
a.  For Annuity Starting Dates in limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007: 
(I)  If the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age 65: 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement: The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in Code section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement: The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)a.(I)(i) of this subsection (a). For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the member. 
(II)  Except with respect to a member who is a "qualified member" as defined in section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code), if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is before age 62: 
(i)  If the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement: The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation with actuarial equivalence computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate assumption and the mortality basis prescribed in Code section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) for that annuity starting date (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  If the plan does have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement: The dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of (aa) the dollar limitation multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this subsection (a), and (bb) the limitation determined under subparagraph (3)a.(II)(i) of this subsection (a). 
b.  For annuity starting dates in limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007: 
Age as of Annuity Starting Date: Adjustment of Dollar Limitation: Over 65 The smaller of: (a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan; or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 65, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). Any increase in the Dollar Limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph shall not reflect a mortality decrement between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 62 to 65 No adjustment. Less than 62 The smaller of: (a) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using the interest rate and mortality basis specified by the board of trustees for determining actuarial equivalence under the plan; or (b) The actuarial equivalent of the limitation for age 62, computed using a 5.00 percent interest rate and the mortality basis prescribed in Code section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). This adjustment shall not apply to any "qualified member" as defined in section 415(b)(2)(H), nor to survivor and disability benefits as defined in section 415(b)(2)(I) of the code.  
(4)  With respect to clause (3)a.(I)(i), clause (3)a.(II)(i) and paragraph (3)b. above, no adjustment shall be made to the dollar limitation to reflect the probability of a member's death between the annuity starting date and age 62, or between age 65 and the annuity starting date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the member prior to the annuity starting date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the annuity starting date, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member's death if the plan does not charge members for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity, as defined in Code section 417(c), upon the member's death. 
(5)  The term "limitation year" is the 12-month period which is used for application of the limitations under Code section 415 and shall be the calendar year. 
(6)  The limitations set forth in this subsection (a) shall not apply if the annual pension does not exceed $10,000.00 provided the member has never participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city. 
(7)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection 415(d) of the Code. 
(8)  In the case of a member who has fewer than ten years of participation in the plan, the dollar limitation set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection (a) shall be multiplied by a fraction - (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is 10. 
(9)  Any portion of a member's benefit that is attributable to mandatory member contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under section 415 of the Code. 
(10)  Should any member participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the city, in any case in which the member's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the member's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that the member's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation. 
(11)  For a member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(12)  The determination of the annual pension under paragraph a.(1) of this subsection (a) shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under section 415 of the Code) social security supplements described in section 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(13)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of section 415 of the Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this subsection (a) and the provisions of section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this subsection (a) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions. 
(14)  For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth in sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code section 402(g)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the member and which is not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of section 125 or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this subsection (a), compensation paid or made available during such limitation years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the member by reason of section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. For limitation years on or after July 1, 2007, compensation shall include payments that otherwise qualify as compensation and that are made by the later of: (a) 21/2 months after severance from employment with the employer, and (b) the end of the limitation year that includes the date of severance. 
(b)  Required beginning date: Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of: 
-April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant attains or will attain the age of 701/2 years; or 
-April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the participant retires. 
(c)  Required minimum distributions. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date as defined in subsection (b) of this section 58-104. 
(2)  Death of participant before distributions begin. 
a.  If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(i)  If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
(ii)  If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(iii)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
b.  The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows: 
(i)  Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in subparagraph (2)(A) above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(I)  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or 
(II)  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(ii)  No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
c.  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, Subparagraphs (2)(A) and 2(B) above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the participant. 
(3)  Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's lifetime. 
a.  Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
b.  Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph (3)(B), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with subparagraphs (4)(A), (4)(B) and (4)(C) below. If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
a.  General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
(ii)  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs (2) or (3) above, whichever is applicable, of this subsection (c); 
(iii)  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
(iv)  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(I)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(II)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the Code; 
(III)  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death; or 
(IV)  To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment. 
b.  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subparagraph (2)(A)(i) or (2)(A)(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
c.  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  For purposes of this subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph (2)(A) above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9)-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
b.  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (c). 
c.  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(d)  Eligible rollover distributions: 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section: 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
(i)  any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; 
(ii)  any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; 
(iii)  the portion of any distribution which is made upon hardship of the member; and 
(iv)  the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code, an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, or, with respect to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of Code section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. 
c.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code or an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code shall be considered a distributee. 
d.  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in section 401(a)(31) of the Code, payable under the plan shall be $1,000.00. 
(f)  Compensation limitations under 401(a)(17): In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000.00, as adjusted by the commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding 12 months, over which compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. 
    Any reference in the plan to the limitation under section 401(a)(17) of the Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision. 
(g)  At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2010-21, § 5, adopted Aug. 17, 2010, repealed former § 58-105, which pertained to distribution generally, and renumbered §§ 58-106-58-110 as §§ 58-105-58-109. See the Code Comparative Table for full derivation of former § 58-105. 
Sec. 58-106. - Investment of funds-Objective. 
(a)  It shall be the objective of the municipal police officers' retirement fund that it be managed, administered, operated, and funded in such a manner as to maximize the protection of the fund while achieving the actuarial required objective return. In pursuit of this objective, the assets of the fund will be invested primarily, but not exclusively, in publicly traded instruments generally considered to be of investment grade or higher, as described in F.S. § 185.07(1). Consistent with this objective is the mandate that the fund will be capable of providing retirement benefits to participants in accordance with the plan benefits as stated in F.S. ch. 185 and this Code. 
(b)  Investment guidelines. The board's investments shall be governed by the investment policy statement and guidelines, which shall be periodically reviewed by the board. The board shall have the authority to invest in all lawful investments, as permitted by F.S. ch. 185 and § 215.47. 
(Code 1982, § 3.14.1(a); Ord. No. 86-07, § 2, 3-4-1986; Ord. No. 00-3, § 3, 3-21-2000; Ord. No. 2010-21, § 5, 8-17-2010; Ord. No. 2011-07, § 3, 7-19-2011) 
Editor's note- See editor's note to § 58-105. 
Sec. 58-107. - Same-Investment guidelines. 
(a)  A maximum of 50 percent of the plan's assets, plus or minus 20 percent, may be invested in pooled common stock funds, other equity securities or convertible securities that may be converted to common stocks. Generally, but not exclusively, the assets will only be invested in major companies of high quality, have a current rating in one of the three highest classifications by a major rating service, with at least $50,000,000.00 in market capitalization. The companies shall be in a leadership position in their market and have an established proven record for growth potential. The actual proportion of equities held at any one time will be based upon a professional determination of market conditions at the time such investment or reinvestment is made. In selected conditions, equities of foreign corporations that are actively traded in American markets may be used where permitted by applicable regulations, as long as such corporations meet the quality standards established by American corporations. Foreign securities will not at any time amount to more than 25 percent of the equity investment portfolio at market value. No more than five percent of the portfolio may be invested in any one company. 
(b)  Publicly traded bonds, in a professionally managed pool, can be used as investments providing the combined pool of bond investments has an overall quality rating that would command a rating in one of the three highest classifications by a major rating service. Investments should be made generally in United States corporate and United States government and/or agency obligations. However, issues of foreign corporations and/or government obligations can be used as a minor (twenty-five percent or less of the bond portfolio) portion of this form of investment subject to similar quality ratings as domestic bonds. Maximum exposures to risk in bonds should be limited to no more than 25 percent in one industry or five percent in any single credit. Bond investments will be diversified among industries and among companies within industries. 
(c)  Private placement bonds or securities can be used to produce a higher rate of return than is obtainable through a fund composed of publicly traded bonds. Such private placements shall be with companies that have investment quality ratings from a major rating service on their outstanding debt. The aggregate pool of investments shall warrant a combined rating in one of the three highest classifications by a major rating service. No more than 25 percent of the funds allocated to private placements will be invested in any single industry. No more than 20 percent of the entire funds assets can be used for private placements. The average maturity of new private placements should generally not exceed 15 years. 
(d)  Short-term investments can be used to provide a relatively safe investment with emphasis on generating a level of current income consistent with capital preservation. Investment grade, short-term investment instruments such as: money market instruments with a maturity of less than two years, commercial paper, bank certificates of deposits, as well as banker's acceptances, may be used. Investments in commercial paper can be used, but will be generally those bearing a rating in one of the three highest classifications by a major rating service. 
(e)  The board shall identify and publicly report any direct or indirect holdings it may have in any scrutinized company, as defined in F.S. § 215.473, and proceed to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities it may have in such company beginning January 1, 2010 and shall thereafter be prohibited from purchasing or holding such securities.

Sec. 58-108. - Credited service. 
    "Credited service" means the aggregate number of years of service and fractional parts of years of service of any police officer, including unused accrued annual and medical leave, as reported to the board of trustees by the city in accordance with the city's policies and collective bargaining agreements and applicable law, omitting intervening years and fractional parts of years when such police officer may not have been employed by the city, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  No police officer shall receive credited service for years or fractional parts of years of service if they have withdrawn their contributions to the fund for those years or fractional parts of years of service, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions they have withdrawn, plus interest as determined by the board of trustees, within 90 days after reemployment with the city. Credited service shall not be granted for service for which the member is entitled to receive a benefit from another governmental or military retirement or pension system. 
(2)  Credited service under this section shall be provided for service as a police officer, as defined in F.S. § 185.02(11), for any law enforcement agency and for voluntary or involuntary military service in the Armed Forces of the United States. 
(3)  In determining the credited service of any police officer, credit for voluntary or involuntary time spent in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States shall be added to the years of actual service with the city, in accordance with F.S. § 185.02(5) and the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 USC § 4301 et seq., as they may be amended. 
(4)  Election to purchase credited service, for prior service with the city, service with any other law enforcement agency or military service, shall be made in writing to the board of trustees within 90 days following the date on which the member attains ten years of credited service in the retirement fund. The cost of credited service purchased for prior service with the city or any other law enforcement agency shall be the full actuarial cost of all credited service purchased hereunder computed as a lump sum payment into the fund. The cost of credited service purchased for military service shall be computed as a lump sum payment into the fund at the rate of five percent of the member's current base salary for each year that is being purchased. Provided that as permitted by federal law pretax trustee-to-trustee transfer of amounts in a member's deferred compensation account (Internal Revenue Code Sec. 457) for the purchase of such credited service shall be allowed. For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a police officer, in addition to service as a police officer in this state, credit may be given for federal, other state, or county service if the prior service is recognized by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as provided under chapter 633, or the police officer provides proof to the board of trustees that his or her service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a police officer under F.S. § 185.02(5)(c). 
(5)  Unless prohibited by Florida law, a police officer may elect to count all of his or her unused accrued annual and medical leave days as credited service and count such credited service to achieve continuous service for eligibility for normal retirement and health insurance benefits but not for meeting eligibility for participation in the deferred retirement option plan.

Editor's note- See editor's note to § 58-105. 
Sec. 58-110. - Share plan. 
    Pursuant to F.S. § 185.35, a defined contribution plan component ("share plan") is hereby established as a component of this fund, but it will not be activated, funded, or otherwise utilized unless and until a portion of Chapter 185 premium tax revenues have been assigned to fund the share plan, except as required under F.S. § 185.35. The funding provisions of this share plan, when and if it is activated, shall be negotiated by the city and the police officers' collective bargaining representative. If the city and the police officers' collective bargaining representative fail to reach mutual consent with respect to the disposition of premium tax revenues, the share plan shall be funded in accordance with F.S. § 185.35(1). Notwithstanding the establishment of the share plan, nothing herein shall be construed to require funding of, or guarantee any benefit under this section. Effective October 1, 2015, a share plan shall be established within this plan as follows: 
(1)  For accounting purposes, an individual share account shall be established for each active member (including DROP participants) of the pension plan. The plan shall account for each member's share account balance as provided herein. 
(2)  Each active plan member who has at least one full year of credited service on the last day of any fiscal year in which premium tax revenues are allocated towards the share plan (available funds) shall receive an equal share of the available funds, less administrative expenses, deposited into his or her share account. 
(3)  On January 1 of each year, if there are available funds, share accounts shall be credited with interest at an annual rate equal to the market rate of return on pension fund investments for the preceding plan year. 
(4)  Available funds and share account balances shall be comingled with pension fund assets for investment purposes, and invested by the board of trustees with other pension fund assets. 
(5)  If there are available funds, the plan administrator shall provide an annual statement to the board of trustees and each share plan member on or before April 1 of each year, showing each member's individual share account balance and the interest credited to the member's account for the prior plan year. 
(6)  The expense of administering the share plan for the preceding year shall be determined by the board of trustees and charged against the available funds received for that year, before allocations are made to member share accounts. 
(7)  A member's share account shall be distributed to the member within 60 days after the end of any calendar quarter following separation of service. A member's share account distribution may be paid directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a member dies before retirement, the member's share account balance on the date of death shall be distributed to the member's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries. In the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased participant, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as described in section 402(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(8)  If a share plan member separates from employment prior to attaining vested status or separates from employment after attaining vested status but elects to receive a refund of member contributions in lieu of any benefit from the plan, the member shall forfeit his or her share account balance, and the account balance shall be added to the available funds for that year, and reallocated to other share plan member accounts as provided herein. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing establishment of a share plan, the city and the police officers' collective bargaining representative have reached the agreement and mutual consent that all premium tax revenues received on and after October 1, 2015, shall be used to fund current benefit levels and offset the city's contributions toward the retirement plan. The funding and structure of this share plan shall be modified only by the mutual consent of the collective bargaining parties or by operation of F.S. § 185.35. (Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 1-16-2018)

b.  Direct rollover. All accrued deferred retirement option plan benefits, plus interest, shall be paid from the deferred retirement option plan directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.

State Law reference- Prohibition against unconscionable price during a declared state of emergency, F.S. § 501.160. 

Sec. 62-171. - Application of article. 
    This article shall be in effect when a state of emergency, as a result of or in anticipation of an imminent natural disaster, is declared by the city council. In the event that the exigencies of the situation do not permit the convening or polling of the city council, the city manager, with the concurrence of the mayor or acting mayor, may declare this article in effect. This article shall become inoperative when the emergency is declared over by the city council. 
(Code 1982, § 39B.01; Ord. No. 89-78, § 1, 12-5-1989) 
Sec. 62-172. - Purpose. 
    If the city is subjected to a natural disaster, probably in the form of a hurricane, many will be left homeless, without water, food, and electrical power. The citizens of the city will be in dire need of household goods, materials, and services in order to be able to inhabit their homes and operate their businesses and to assist in rebuilding the city. The availability of goods, services, and materials to our citizens at normal predisaster prices is absolutely necessary and required for the health, safety, welfare, and comfort of the community. The selling or offering for sale of any goods, materials, or services at prices in excess of those in existence prior to the declared emergency is unconscionable, against public policy, and is inimical to rebuilding efforts that are necessary to preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the community.

    It is unlawful to sell or offer to sell any goods, services, or materials at an unconscionable price in excess of those prices for the same or similar goods, services, or materials that were in effect immediately prior to the declaration of emergency; provided, however, that if it can be demonstrated by the seller that the seller's cost of the particular goods, services, or materials has increased since the declaration of emergency and that the price at which these goods, services, or materials are now being sold or offered is a reasonable reflection of the increased cost to the seller, such sale or offering for sale shall not be unlawful. 
(Code 1982, § 39B.03; Ord. No. 89-78, § 1, 12-5-1989) 
Sec. 62-174. - Evidentiary standards and defenses. 
(a)  It is prima facie evidence that a price is unconscionable if: 
(1)  The amount charged represents a gross disparity between the price of the commodity or rental or lease of any dwelling unit or self-storage facility that is the subject of the offer or transaction and the average price at which that commodity or dwelling unit or self-storage facility was rented, leased, sold, or offered for rent or sale in the usual course of business during the 30 days immediately prior to a declaration of a state of emergency, and the increase in the amount charged is not attributable to additional costs incurred in connection with the rental or sale of the commodity or rental or lease of any dwelling unit or self-storage facility, or national or international market trends; or 
(2)  The amount charged grossly exceeds the average price at which the same or similar commodity was readily obtainable in the trade area during the 30 days immediately prior to a declaration of a state of emergency, and the increase in the amount charged is not attributable to additional costs incurred in connection with the rental or sale of the commodity or rental or lease of any dwelling unit or self-storage facility, or national or international market trends. 
(b)  A price increase approved by an appropriate government agency shall not be a violation of this section. 
(c)  This section shall not apply to sales by growers, producers, or processors of raw or processed food products, except for retail sales of such products to the ultimate consumer within the area of the declared state of emergency. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 501.160(1)(b), (4), (5).

(b)  Each violation of section 62-173 is a separate and distinct offense subject to a fine as provided in section 1-14.

The seller may at its option waive the 60-day notice requirement. If either the city or the seller requires an additional extension, it must give notice to the other no less than 30 days before the existing extension expires, except in cases of bona fide emergency or waiver of the notice requirement by the other party.

Sec. 78-41. - Extension of city water and sewer services for developments and projects. 
(a)  Extension of water distribution and sewage collection systems to developments and projects. It is the city's policy to extend its water distribution and sewage collection systems throughout the city's service areas in a planned, orderly and economical manner. In those instances in which a developer requests extension of the city's water distribution and/or sewage collection system to serve the developer's development or project earlier than when the city has planned for such system extension, such developer shall be required to construct or otherwise pay the cost of such complete water distribution and sewage collection system extensions and facilities associated with serving the development or project and with sufficient capacity to serve the city's future service demands. In such case the city shall negotiate an agreement with the developer setting forth the developer's responsibility for constructing and funding the off-site system facilities and the requirements for oversizing such facilities to meet future service demands. This provision recognizes instances in which a developer will be required to advance funds to construct facilities sized in accordance with the city's future needs. The city may assume a portion of the cost of such system extension projects when it deems it to be in the best interest of the city, as determined in the city's sole and absolute discretion. The developer agreement shall provide for a refund plan based upon receipt by the city of payment for the pro-rata share of those other properties connecting to oversized system facilities installed and funded by the developer. The amount of the pro-rata share of costs for each property anticipated to be served by such system extension, as well as the amount of such costs that may be refunded to the developer, shall be determined by the city and established at the time of and included in the developer agreement. In no event shall the developer be refunded for connection of other properties to such system facilities nor shall such properties be required to pay for their pro-rata share, an amount greater than the amount that they would have paid at the time of the extension if the city had performed or contracted for the work. The developer shall not be entitled to any interest upon any refund of the developer's costs or advance. In the event that more than one developer has paid a refundable advance or has directly funded construction of the required facilities, the developer having first funded the facilities shall have first right of cost recovery until his investment less the amount of his own pro-rata share is recovered. However, the city shall have first right of cost recovery in the event the city constructs or funds any part of the system facilities and improvements. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any such agreement shall be limited to a term of not more than 20 years, after which time any portion of the developer's costs or advance not refunded by the terms and conditions of the agreement shall lapse and thereafter such agreement shall be automatically canceled and without further effect. The city's right to recover its portion of the costs for the system facilities and improvements shall survive and be unaffected by such cancellation of the developer agreement. 
(b)  Extension of water distribution and sewage collection facilities within developments. Each developer of a project or development to be served by the city's water distribution and/or sewage collection systems shall be responsible for the funding, design, construction, installation, inspection and testing of the complete water distribution and sewage collection systems located in the streets or rights-of-way adjoining or within the boundaries of the developer's property necessary for providing such services to the project or development property. The developer with title to such system facilities shall transfer clear and unencumbered title to the system facilities to the city upon completion of construction, inspection, and testing, and acceptance of the facilities by the city, together with all easements required by the city. 
(c)  System components. Water distribution and sewage collection systems shall include all component parts of the water distribution system including, but not limited to, valves, fittings laterals, hydrants and all appurtenances, which shall be shown upon the city approved design of such water distribution system, and all component parts of the sewage collection system, including, but not limited to, all collection lines, manholes, force mains, lift and pumping stations, including the site for same, and all other appurtenances, which shall be shown on the city approved design of such sewage collection system. 
(d)  Design and construction standards. All design and construction pursuant to this section shall adhere to the latest revision of construction specifications and requirements approved by the city for water distribution and sewage collection system facilities and protection and restoration of rights-of-way and improvements thereon. All design, plans, specifications, and construction shall be subject to approval by the city in its sole and absolute discretion. The developer, at the developer's expense, shall supply the city with as-built plans and mylars in the quantity required by the city. Notwithstanding section 71.04 and other permit requirements, all construction pursuant to this section shall require a city right-of-way permit. 
(e)  Existing agreements. The city recognizes that certain agreements regarding the extension of the city's water distribution and sewage collection systems have been entered into by the city and developers or property owners in the past. Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter, abrogate, obviate or avoid the respective obligations of the parties in those agreements.

The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater facility that will interfere with its operation, including interferences with its use or disposal of domestic wastewater residuals; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater facility that will pass through the water reclamation facility, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the water reclamation facility; 
(3)  To protect both the general public and wastewater facility personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment; 
(4)  To implement a low pressure sewage collection system program utilizing septic tank effluent pump (STEP) systems to reduce septic tank effluent reaching the groundwater and thereby reducing nutrient loadings to the Indian River Lagoon;

Sec. 78-111. - Pretreatment facilities. 
(a)  Operation and maintenance of pretreatment facility. The director may require any industrial user to provide, operate and maintain a pretreatment facility in order to comply with this article and all federal categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and prohibitions. The following conditions apply to the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of any pretreatment facility required under this section: 
(1)  Any such facility shall be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense; and 
(2)  The industrial user shall not construct, operate, or modify any such facility prior to obtaining the director's approval. The director shall have authority to approve or reject the industrial user's plans for designing, constructing, operating, maintaining, and modifying the facility and for otherwise meeting compliance schedules. The director's exercise of such authority shall not absolve the industrial user of the user's responsibility to comply with the requirements of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and acceptable to the director prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(b)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require industrial users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate domestic wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and other conditions as may be necessary to protect the wastewater facility and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The director may require any person discharging into the wastewater facility to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(3)  Grease traps, interceptors, and/or oil/water separators (interceptors) shall be required when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil or sand. Interceptors shall be required in establishments such as, but not limited to, food service establishments, transportation/equipment cleaning establishments, service stations, repair shops, or other commercial or industrial facilities where wastes containing grease, oil, flammable material, sand or other harmful constituents can be discharged into the wastewater facility. Interceptors shall not be required for residential users. An engineer acting on behalf of the user shall determine the type, capacity and location of the interceptor. The interceptor shall be located so that it is easily accessible for cleaning, sampling, and inspection. The interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense, but in no instance shall the cleaning frequency be less than once per year. 
(c)  Accidental discharge/slug plan and procedure. Each user shall provide and maintain at their expense, protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials, slug loads or other substances regulated by this article. The director may require any user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. If such plan is required, detailed plans and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the director for review and approval. The plan shall include, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges. 
(2)  Description of all stored chemicals. 
(3)  Procedures to prevent accidental spills, including: 
a.  Maintenance of storage areas. 
b.  Handling and transfer of materials. 
c.  Loading and unloading operations. 
d.  Control of plant site stormwater runoff. 
e.  Worker training. 
f.  Building containment structures for equipment. 
g.  Measures for controlling toxic pollutants, including solvents. 
h.  Procedures and equipment for emergency response.

(4)  Procedures for immediately notifying the director of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under section 78-86 with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days. 
(Ord. No. 2012-03, § 1, 2-21-2012) 
Sec. 78-112. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  The city may require the user to provide and maintain at his own expense monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or the regulated process discharge. The monitoring facility should be situated on the user's property at a location approved by the city prior to installation. There shall be ample room in or near the sampling manhole or facility to allow flow measurements, accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the director. 
(b)  The city may require the user to install and maintain at his own expense suitable flow metering and sampling equipment to facilitate the accurate observation, sampling, and flow measurement of process wastewater. The sampling and measuring equipment shall be properly operated, cleaned, and maintained in good working order at all times. The sampling and metering equipment shall be accessible at all times. The devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated periodically based on manufacturer's recommendation to ensure their accuracy. 
(c)  The failure of an industrial user to keep his monitoring facility in good working order shall be deemed a separate violation of this article and shall not be grounds for claiming that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(Ord. No. 2012-03, § 1, 2-21-2012) 
Sec. 78-113. - Wastewater discharge permits-Procedure; contents; conditions. 
(a)  Wastewater survey. When requested by the director, any industrial user shall submit information as to the nature and characteristics of the industrial user's wastewater by completing a wastewater survey prior to commencing their discharge. The director is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require industrial users to update the survey. Failure to complete or update the wastewater survey shall be reasonable grounds for terminating service to the industrial user and shall be considered a violation of this article. 
(b)  Users required to obtain permit. Any industrial user who has, in the director's opinion, a reasonable potential for any of the following shall obtain an industrial waste discharge permit: 
(1)  Violating the provisions of section 78-86;

DIVISION 4. - PRETREATMENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 78-141. - Reports and information. 
    Industrial users shall submit to the director, at such intervals as the director may prescribe, reports accurately describing the character and quantity of the wastewater which they discharge into the wastewater facility, and any other information, including reports prescribed by federal laws, rules, or regulations, requested by the director relating to the generation of such wastewater. 
(Ord. No. 2012-03, § 1, 2-21-2012) 
Sec. 78-142. - Baseline monitoring. 
(a)  Reporting deadlines. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the wastewater facility shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsection (b) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsection (b) of this section. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(b)  Required information. Users described in subsection (a) of this section shall submit the information set forth as follows: 
(1)  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
(2)  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
(3)  Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operations carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the wastewater facility from the regulated processes. 
(4)  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the wastewater facility from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e) and F.A.C. 62-625.410(6). 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
a.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process and any new categorically regulated processes for existing sources; 
b.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with section 78-144 of this article. Where the standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the director or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard; 
c.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph; 
d.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e), or F.A.C. 62-625.410(6), to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) or F.A.C. 62-625.410(6) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the director; 
e.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section 78-144; 
f.  The director may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; and 
g.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the wastewater facility. 
(6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance shall be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 78-143. 
(8)  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 78-143(h). 
(Ord. No. 2012-03, § 1, 2-21-2012) 
Sec. 78-143. - Compliance reports. 
(a)  Compliance schedule reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection 78-142(b)(7): 
(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(2)  No increment referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall exceed nine months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
(b)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the wastewater facility, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in subsections 78-142(b)(4) through (6). For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (h) of this section. 
(c)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the director but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(2)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (h) of this section. At the discretion of the director and in consideration of such factors as high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the director may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. Falsification of self-monitoring reports shall be considered a significant violation of this article and could lead to termination of the user's wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(4)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in section 78-144, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(5)  The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
a.  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
b.  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The industrial user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See section 78-113(f)(7). 
c.  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
d.  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user as defined herein and include the certification statement at section 78-113(g). 
e.  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
f.  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the director must be included as a condition in the industrial user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the director for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
g.  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the director, the industrial user must certify on each report with the following statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user: 
"Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for Managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR [specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under Section 78-143(c)(1)." 
h.  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the industrial user's operations, the industrial user must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of section 78-143(c)(1), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the director, and notify the director. 
i.  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(d)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. 
(1)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
(2)  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(e)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load that may cause potential problems for the wastewater facility, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater facility, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (e)(1) of this section.

(Code 1982, § 35.51; Ord. No. 89-59, § 2, 8-29-1989) 
Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction, § 1-2. 
Sec. 82-193. - Call allocation system. 
(a)  To be eligible for approval for the police department's list of wrecker services, the wrecker operator's place of business must be located within the corporate limits or within two miles of the corporate limits. 
(b)  Wrecker operators shall be called for the removal of a wrecked, disabled, stolen, or abandoned vehicle by the police department according to the operator's placement on a wrecker rotation list as maintained by the police department and according to the wrecker classification for the size of the vehicle to be towed. Wrecker operators will be called in succession from the top of the list. Following each call an operator will be rotated to the bottom of the list except as provided in this article. An operator may respond to a call with a tow truck classified to meet or exceed the size of the vehicle to be towed. 
(c)  The wrecker operator may not assign, transfer, pledge, surrender, or otherwise encumber or dispose of his approval under this article or his place on the rotation list. A replacement or successor operator must be approved under this article before being placed within the police department's call system. 
(d)  Wrecker requests from the field will be transmitted to the city police officer who will contact the proper wrecker operator. Owners' requests for wrecker operators will not be rotated and such operators will maintain their position on the list. The police department may cancel a request for services of a participating wrecker operator at any time. In the event of cancellation or response without rendering service, the operator will not be rotated but will maintain his position on the list. 
(e)  Wrecker operators will be listed only once on each list and only in the name under which they are qualified under the provision of this article and conducting business in this state. It is prohibited for a wrecker operator conducting business at one location to receive multiple listings or classifications by utilizing a different or fictitious name for trucks operating out of the same location or by utilizing the same named trucks out of different locations. When two or more corporations are owned by the same individual, partnership or parent corporation, each may have a separate listing only when each has a separate location and different corporate officers. All wreckers operated in conjunction with a wrecker operator's towing and recovery business will have a number painted on both sides of the cab. The same number on two or more vehicles is prohibited. The number shall be painted in contrasting color and at least four inches in height. 
(f)  Wrecker operators shall only respond to accidents or remove vehicles involved in an accident within the police department's jurisdiction pursuant to call from the police department as set forth in this article. In the event of a call to a wrecker operator by someone other than the police department, such operator will first clear the call through the city police department before proceeding to the scene. 
(g)  Wrecker operators shall have one day and one night telephone number. Answering services or beepers will not be permitted. The wrecker operator will notify the city police department's dispatcher at the time the call is received whether or not he will respond. The wrecker operator shall notify the police department of any additional telephone numbers or change of numbers. 
(h)  Wrecker operators shall be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
(i)  The police department may call specialized recovery equipment on a nearest available basis in the event of specialized recovery requirements not otherwise met by the wrecker operators on the rotation list. 
(j)  For multiple-car accidents involving multiple disabled vehicles, the wrecker operator subject to call from the rotation list will be advised by the dispatcher of the number of tow trucks needed to separately remove each vehicle. The wrecker operator will be given the option of removing all of the disabled vehicles to be removed if the operator maintains the number of tow trucks to accomplish removal. If the wrecker operator lacks the capacity to handle multiple removals, he shall nevertheless be called and additional wrecker operators called as needed from the rotation list. The first wrecker on the list will have a choice of wrecked vehicles. If the first-listed wrecker does not arrive on the scene within a reasonable time, the investigating officer will assign vehicles to available operators. The first wrecker on the scene may be required to move vehicles from the roadway, and such movement will not affect the choice of wrecked vehicles. No fee shall be charged for such service. 
(k)  Wrecker logs will be maintained at the city police department. 
(l)  If a wrecker does not respond to a request for service made under this article or if the request is cancelled pursuant to this policy, the operator shall be rotated to the bottom of the list. 
(Code 1982, § 35.52; Ord. No. 89-59, § 2, 8-29-1989) 
Sec. 82-194. - Response to calls. 
(a)  The wrecker operator shall respond to all requests for service made through the city police department's dispatcher within a reasonable time under the existing conditions and circumstances. If response cannot be made within a reasonable time, the wrecker operator shall notify the city police department's dispatcher of the estimated time of delay and the reasons therefor, and the dispatcher, if he determines the delay is unreasonable, may cancel the request for service and use the services of another participating wrecker operator. 
(b)  Unless authorized by the city police department duty officer, flashing amber lights shall not be used while responding to a call for wrecker service. 
(c)  Flashing amber lights shall be used at the scene and when towing from the scene in accordance with F.S. § 316.2397(3). 
(d)  When a vehicle is released at the scene by the investigating officer, the wrecker operator shall tow to any location the owner requests within the limits of the city. 
(e)  Any ancillary service, such as the use of dolly, dropping, and hooking up linkage, are to be performed only if required and appropriate. 
(f)  The motor vehicle owner or operator is responsible for payment of charges imposed by the wrecker operator. 
(g)  The wrecker operator will forfeit a call if the wrecker operator or his employees or agents respond to a call in such a condition that the officer on the scene reasonably believes that he is incapable of safely removing the vehicle. Such condition shall include, but shall not be limited to, impairment due to consumption of alcohol or any chemical substance or controlled substance.

(1)  Centerlines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of dedicated streets, highways, alleys, or rights-of-way shall be construed as following such centerlines as they exist on the ground except where variation of actual location from mapped location would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, in which case the boundary shall be construed as remaining in its location except where ownership of the vacated street is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary shall be construed as moving with the ownership. 
(2)  Lot lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, public property lines, and the like shall be construed as following such lines; provided, however, that where such boundaries are adjacent to a dedicated street, alley, highway, or right-of-way, the boundaries shall be construed as running to the middle of the street, highway, alley, or right-of-way. 
(3)  City limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such city limit. 
(4)  Railroad tracks. Boundaries indicated as following railroad tracks shall be construed as being midway between the main tracks. 
(5)  Boundaries indicated as following mean high water lines and centerlines of streams, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water. These boundaries shall be construed as following such mean high water lines or centerlines. In case of a change in mean high water line, or of the course or extent of bodies of water, the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the change, except where such moving would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel; and in such a manner as to avoid changing the zoning status of any lot or parcel. 
(6)  Body of water. Boundaries indicated as entering any body of water but not continuing to intersection with other zoning boundaries or with the limits of jurisdiction of the City of Vero Beach shall be construed as extending in the direction in which they enter the body of water to intersection with other zoning boundaries or with the limits of city jurisdiction. 
(7)  Boundaries parallel. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subparagraphs (1) through (6) above shall be construed as being parallel to or extensions of such features. 
(b)  Situations requiring interpretation: In situations not covered by the preceding rules in this section or where the property or street layout existing on the ground is at variance with that shown on the official zoning map, the planning director shall interpret the official zoning map in accordance with the intent and purpose of these zoning regulations.

Conditional uses will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Findings made in consideration of a conditional use are not justification for approval of other conditional uses. Neighborhood stability and impact on abutting properties shall be of prime importance in consideration of conditional use approval. Indicators of an unacceptable conditional use include the noise, traffic, and scale of a proposed use in relation to nearby uses. In addition to all criteria in the Code of Ordinances, the following criteria shall be considered in decision making relative to approval or denial of a conditional use: 
(1)  If in the judgment of the planning and zoning board, based on evidence presented, the proposed use will create noise, traffic, odor or other nuisances to a degree that it will be disruptive to abutting or nearby properties, the conditional use shall not be approved. 
(2)  If in the judgment of the planning and zoning board, based on evidence presented, the scale of a proposed conditional use is determined to be inconsistent with existing or anticipated development in the vicinity, the conditional use shall not be approved. Indicators of scale shall be building bulk and height, open space, number of vehicle trips per day, and the number of parking spaces required in relation to a permitted use for the property. 
(3)  Sites shall be located on arterial or collector roadways as identified in the comprehensive plan or abutting an existing commercial district or a professional, office and institutional district. 
(4)  The level of service on collector or arterial roadways either abutting or connected to a roadway segment which serves as access to the site shall operate at level of service "D" peak hour/peak season or better during predevelopment conditions, and the traffic impact of the proposed development shall not lower the level of service. This shall be documented by the applicant and confirmed by the city department of engineering prior to approval. 
(5)  All on-site utility lines, including telephone, cablevision and electric, shall be under ground. 
(6)  A site plan application shall accompany all applications for conditional use. 
(7)  A 20-foot-wide landscape buffer shall be provided that includes one tree for every 40 linear feet along the common property line between the single-family use and the conditional use and a screen of plant material of a minimum of six feet in height that substantially obscures view of the site from the abutting site.

ARTICLE III. - RM-8 MEDIUM- AND RM-10 MEDIUM-HIGH-DENSITY MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT 

Sec. 61.35. - Purpose of district. 
(a)  These districts are designed to provide suitable areas for medium-density residential development where sufficient urban services and facilities are provided or where the extension of such services and facilities will be physically and economically feasible. It is also the intent of this section to permit single-family and two-family structures as well as multiple-family structures developed within a medium-density range as defined in the text and provided a sufficient open space is preserved on the same lot. Also, within the district, the density of the new development proposals shall be compatible with existing development, the policies of this chapter, and the comprehensive land use plan with a view toward preserving stability of established areas, and cultivating smooth transitions in residential densities where gradual shifts in density are in order cue to varied levels of access to public services, including transportation and utilities, unique physical features of the property, nature and intensity of abutting land uses, or other site considerations. 
(b)  These districts may include, as conditional uses, day care services, educational institutions, golf courses and country clubs, places of worship, public park and recreation areas, public and private utilities, and cultural activities which are necessary to service specifically the residents, or which are benefited by and compatible with a residential environment. Such facilities should be accessibly located and appropriately situated in order to satisfy spatial requirements of respective community facilities. 
(c)  It is the express purpose of this section to exclude from these districts all buildings or other structures and uses having commercial characteristics, whether operated for profit or otherwise.

Sec. 61.38. - Provisions regulating all conditional uses. 
    A conditional use may be permitted by the city planning and zoning board, provided the use is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated so that the public health, safety, and welfare are protected. Conditional uses will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Findings made in consideration of a conditional use are not justification for approval of other conditional uses. Neighborhood stability and impact on abutting properties shall be of prime importance in consideration of conditional use approval. Indicators of an unacceptable conditional use include the noise, traffic, and scale of a proposed use in relation to nearby uses. In addition to all criteria in the Code of Ordinances, the following criteria shall be considered in decision making relative to approval or denial of a conditional use: 
(1)  If in the judgment of the planning and zoning board, based on evidence presented, the proposed use will create noise, traffic, odor, or other nuisances to a degree that it will be disruptive to abutting or nearby properties, the conditional use shall not be approved. 
(2)  If in the judgment of the planning and zoning board, based on evidence presented, the scale of a proposed conditional use is determined to be inconsistent with existing or anticipated development in the vicinity, the conditional use shall not be approved. Indicators of scale shall be building bulk and height, open space, number of vehicle trips per day, and the number of parking spaces required in relation to a permitted use for the property. 
(3)  The use conforms to all applicable provisions of the district in which it is located. 
(4)  Sites shall be located on an arterial or collector roadway as identified in the comprehensive plan or abutting an existing commercial district or professional, office, and institutional district thereby serving as a logical transitional use between residential and commercially developed properties. Where not located on an arterial or collector roadway, as identified in the comprehensive plan, the site shall not abut a single-family residential district. 
(5)  The level of service on collector or arterial roadways either abutting or connected to a roadway segment which serves as access to the site shall operate at level of service "D" peak hour/peak season or better during predevelopment conditions, and the traffic impact of the proposed development shall not lower the level of service. This shall be documented by the applicant and confirmed by the city department of engineering prior to approval. 
(6)  All on-site utility lines, including telephone, cablevision and electric, shall be underground. 
(7)  A site plan application shall accompany all applications for conditional use. 
(8)  For sites abutting or separated by a right-of-way from a single-family zoning district or a single-family use in any residential zoning district, the following requirements shall apply: 
a.  A 20-foot-wide landscape buffer shall be provided which includes one tree for every 40 linear feet along the common property line and screen of plant material a minimum of six feet in height which substantially obscures view of the site from the abutting site. Landscape material shall meet or exceed the specifications outlined in the Landscape and Tree Protection Ordinance. The owner of the abutting property shall have the option to select a solid, six-foot-high concrete block wall in place of the six-foot-high landscape screen. Stucco and paint shall be applied to both sides of the wall. The cost of such wall shall be paid by the owner seeking the conditional use.

Sec. 61.76. - Provisions regulating all conditional uses. 
    A conditional use may be permitted by the city planning and zoning board, provided the use is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated so that the public health, safety, and welfare are protected.

Indicators of an unacceptable conditional use include the noise, traffic, and scale of a proposed use in relation to nearby uses. In addition to all criteria in the Code of Ordinances, the following criteria shall be considered in decision making relative to approval or denial of a conditional use: 
(1)  If in the judgment of the planning and zoning board, based on evidence presented, the proposed use will create noise, traffic, odor, or other nuisances to a degree that it will be disruptive to abutting or nearby properties, the conditional use shall not be approved. 
(2)  If in the judgment of the planning and zoning board, based on evidence presented, the scale of a proposed conditional use is determined to be inconsistent with existing or anticipated development in the vicinity, the conditional use shall not be approved. Indicators of scale shall be building bulk and height, open space, number of vehicle trips per day, and the number of parking spaces required in relation to a permitted use for the property. 
(3)  The use conforms to all applicable provisions of the district in which it is located. 
(4)  Sites shall be located on an arterial or collector roadway as identified in the comprehensive plan or abutting an existing commercial district or professional, office, and institutional district thereby serving as a logical transitional use between residential and commercially developed properties.

(5)  The level of service on collector or arterial roadways either abutting or connected to a roadway segment which serves as access to the site shall operate at level of service "D" peak hour/peak season or better during predevelopment conditions, and the traffic impact of the proposed development shall not lower the level of service. This shall be documented by the applicant and confirmed by the city department of engineering prior to approval. 
(6)  All on-site utility lines, including telephone cablevision and electric, shall be underground. 
(7)  A site plan application shall accompany all applications for conditional use. 
(8)  For sites abutting or separated by a right-of-way from a single-family zoning district or a single-family use in any residential zoning conditional, the following requirements shall apply: 
a.  A 20-foot-wide landscape buffer shall be provided which includes one tree for every 40 linear feet along the common property line and screen of plant material a minimum of six feet in height which substantially obscures view of the site from the abutting site. Landscape material shall meet or exceed the specifications outlined in the Landscape and Tree Protection Ordinance. The owner of the abutting property shall have the option to select a solid, six-foot-high concrete-block wall in place of the six-foot-high landscape screen. The cost of such wall shall be paid by the owner seeking the conditional use. Stucco and paint shall be applied to both sides of the wall.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-15, § 4, adopted November 20, 2017, repealed § 62.48.1. Former § 62.48.1 pertained to medical marijuana treatment center conditional use and derived from Ord. No. 2014-20, adopted November 4, 2014; Ord. No. 2015-27, adopted October 20, 2015; and Ord. No. 2016-19, adopted December 6, 2016. 
Sec. 62.49. - Performance standards. 
(A)  Purpose: The purpose of performance standards is to control commercial and industrial uses; to permit potential nuisances to be measured factually and objectively; to ensure that all industries will provide methods to protect the community from hazards and nuisances which can be prevented by processes of control and nuisance elimination; and to protect industries from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based solely on the nuisance production by any particular type of industry in the past. 
(B)  Application of Standards: 
(1)  Any use established or changed to, and any buildings, structures, or tracts of land developed, constructed, or used for any permitted or permissible principal or accessory use shall comply with all of the performance standards herein set forth for the district involved. 
(2)  If any existing use or building or other structure is extended, enlarged, moved, structurally altered or reconstructed, or any existing use of land is enlarged or moved, the performance standards for the district involved shall apply with respect to such extended, enlarged, moved or structurally altered or reconstructed building or other structure or portion thereof. 
(3)  All existing uses, buildings, or other structures shall comply with the performance standards herein set forth. 
(C)  Performance Standards: 
(1)  Purpose of procedure. The purpose of the performance standards procedure is to ensure that an objective, unbiased determination is made in those cases where there may be substantial uncertainty as to whether an individual land use or group of land uses comply with the performance standards of this chapter, and to formulate practical ways for the alleviation of such noncompliance. 
(2)  Enforcement procedures. Alleged violations of the performance standards shall be investigated by the any code enforcement officer. 
(a)  Required data: Following the initiation of an investigation, the code enforcement officer may require the owner or operator of any proposed use to submit such data and evidence as is needed to make an objective determination. The evidence may include, but is not limited to, the following items: 
1.  Plans of the existing or proposed construction and development. 
2.  A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes, and products. 
3.  Specifications for the mechanisms and techniques used or proposed to be used in restricting the possible emission of any of the dangerous and objectionable elements as set forth in this section. 
4.  Measurements or projections of the amount and rate of emission of said dangerous or objectionable elements. 
Failure to submit data required by the code enforcement officer shall constitute grounds for denial or revocation of an occupancy permit, whichever is appropriate to meet the intent of this chapter. 
(b)  Evaluation of proposed land uses: Subsequent to a review of the proposed land use development plan, the planning director may determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the proposed use may violate the performance standards cited herein. In such case where substantial uncertainty exists as to whether a proposed new land use will comply with the performance standards, the planning director may, at the applicant's expense, request a statement of a professional engineer registered in the State of Florida, which certifies that the planned land use is designed to satisfy the performance standards. 
(c)  Evaluation of existing development: When the planning director ascertains a probable noncompliance by an existing land use, he shall investigate as follows: 
1.  Where determination can be made by the planning director, using equipment normally available to the city or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be made before notice of violation is issued. 
2.  Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes an investigation utilizing city personnel and/or equipment unreasonable, the planning director may retain an expert consultant(s) to determine if a land use activity is in compliance with performance standards. Such consultant(s) shall be fully qualified to give the required information and shall be person(s) or firm(s) mutually agreeable to the planning director and to the owner or operator of the use in question. In the event of inability to select a mutually agreeable consultant(s), the city and the owner or operator may select its independent consultant, in which event each party shall bear its own costs irrespective of the final determination of compliance or noncompliance with the performance standards in question. If one consultant is mutually agreed upon, the cost of the consultant's services shall be borne by the owner or operator of said use, if the use is found to be in violation of the performance standards; but if the use is found by the final authority to be in compliance with the regulation, the city shall bear the cost of the consultant's services. 
(3)  Planning director's action. Within 30 days following the receipt of the required evidence, the planning director shall make a determination as to compliance or noncompliance with the performance standards. If the planning director determines the existing or proposed use is in compliance, he shall authorize the issuance of any permits which may have been withheld pending said determination. 
(4)  Required alterations. The planning director may require modifications or alterations in the existing or proposed construction or the operational procedures to ensure that compliance with the performance standards will be maintained. The operator shall be given a reasonable length of time to effect any changes prescribed by the planning director for the purpose of securing compliance with the performance standards. 
(5)  Appeal to planning and zoning board. The planning and development director's decision holding a person in noncompliance with the performance standards and/or the alterations required may be appealed to the planning and zoning board within ten days following said action by the planning and development director. In the absence of such appeal, the planning and development director's determination shall be final. 
(6)  Cancellation of permits. If, after the conclusion of the time granted for compliance with the performance standards, the planning director finds the violation is still in existence, any permits previously issued shall be void in whole or in part and the operator shall be required to cease operation of the noncomplying activity until the violation is remedied. 
(D)  Performance Standards Specified: 
(1)  General provisions. All uses in this zoning district shall conform to the standards of performance described within the provisions below and shall be so constructed, maintained, and operated so as not to be injurious or offensive to the occupations of adjacent premises by reason of the emission or creation of noise, vibration, smoke, dust, or other particulate matter, toxic, or noxious waste materials, odors, fire, and explosive hazard or glare: All businesses, services, or manufacturing or processing of materials, goods, or products shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings. Storage may be permitted outdoors but shall be effectively screened by a wall, fence, or planting so that the materials shall not be visible from a public way or a residential area and shall be greater than 200 feet from the nearest residential district. 
(2)  Standards regulating nuisances. 
(a)  Noise: Every use shall be so operated so as to comply with the performance standards governing noise in Chapter 38, Article III, Noise Control, of this Code. 
(b)  Vibration: Every use shall be so operated that ground vibration inherently and recurrently generated is not perceptible without instruments at any point on the property line of the property on which the use is located. 
1.  Vibration shall be measured at or beyond any adjacent lot line or residential district line as indicated in Table I below and such measurements shall not exceed the particle velocities so designated. The instrument used for these measurements shall be a three-component measuring system capable of simultaneous measurement of vibration in three mutually perpendicular directions. 
2.  The maximum vibration is given as particle velocity, which may be measured directly with suitable instrumentation or computed on the basis of displacement and frequency. When computed, the following formula shall be used: 
Where: P.V. = 6.28 F × D 
P.V. = Particle velocity, inches per second. 
F = Vibration frequency, cycles per second. 
D = Single amplitude displacement of the vibration, inches. 
3.  The maximum particle velocity shall be the vector sum of the three individual components recorded. Such particle velocity shall not exceed the values given in Table I. 
TABLE I 
Maximum Ground Transmitted Vibration Particle Velocity 
Adjacent Lot Line Inches/Second 
Residential District 0.10 0.02  
If the site is greater than 200 feet from the nearest residential district, the particle velocity at the adjacent lot line may not exceed 0.20. Where vibration is produced as discrete impulses, and such impulses do not exceed a frequency of 100 per minute, then the values in Table I may be multiplied by 2. 
(c)  Air pollutants: Including smoke, particulate matter, odor, and toxic matter. 
1.  Smoke. Every use shall be so operated as to prevent the emission of smoke as specified in "Rules of Department of Environmental Regulations: Air Pollution." 
2.  Particulate matter including dust. Every use shall be so operated as to prevent the emission into the air of dust or other solid matter as specified in "Rules of the Department of Environmental Regulation: Air Pollution." 
3.  Odor. Every use shall be so operated as to prevent the emission of objectionable or offensive odors in such concentration as to be readily perceptible at any point at or beyond the lot line of the property on which the use is located as specified in "Rules of the Department of Environmental Regulation: Air Pollution." 
4.  Toxic matter. The ambient air quality standards for guiding the release of airborne toxic materials across lot lines shall be in accordance with "Rules of the Department of Environmental Regulation: Air Pollution." 
(d)  Fire and explosive hazards: All operations, activities, and uses shall be conducted so as to comply with the performance standards governing fire and explosion hazards prescribed by Indian River County Fire Rescue, and the State of Florida, and applicable technical codes. 
(e)  Glare: Any operation or activity producing glare shall be conducted so that direct light from the source shall not cause illumination in excess of 0.5 footcandles when measured in a residential district.

ARTICLE IX. - MIXED USE DISTRICT 

Sec. 62.200. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this district is to: 
(a)  Establish flexible development standards which can be implemented in areas of the city that are in a state of decline and areas where residential redevelopment activity is needed and desirable. These development standards are designed to preserve and enhance the residential character of neighborhoods while allowing for greater density residential development and small-scale, low-intensity nonresidential uses; 
(b)  Implement policies in the Vero Beach Comprehensive Plan to reduce urban sprawl, encourage infill development in areas with adequate infrastructure, provide for moderate income housing opportunities, discourage strip commercial development, stabilize and increase property values, and reduce energy consumption; and 
(c)  Create an environment where people can live, work, and have recreation opportunities in the same area. 
    It is intended that the combination of traditional residential development patterns and nonresidential uses will make the designated areas a new focus of pedestrian-oriented, residential development activity. Reduced unit sizes, reduced setbacks, transfer development rights, public open space, and design guidelines will be a catalyst for creating moderate-income housing.

Secs. 62.510-62.600. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XIV. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. 62.601. - Purpose. 
    A planned development (PD) is a specially tailored use providing a unique approach to combining and developing parcels of land with the intention of ensuring orderly planning and quality urban design that is in harmony with the existing or potential development of the surrounding neighborhood. Specifically, a PD and the provisions of this article are intended to: 
(1)  Implement policies in the comprehensive plan and vision plan to reduce urban sprawl, encourage infill and redevelopment in areas with adequate infrastructure, discourage strip commercial development, stabilize and increase property values, and reduce energy consumption; 
(2)  Establish flexible development standards which provide incentives for innovative mixed-use development patterns and allow for the creative use of land; 
(3)  Provide incentives to support development that promotes sustainable living, allows for a more efficient use of public services and facilities, and minimizes impacts on surrounding areas through the use of flexible and innovative land development techniques; 
(4)  Allow a mixture of uses, structures, facilities, open space, buffers, and conservation areas in a manner compatible with existing, permitted, and planned uses on adjacent properties; and 
(5)  Promote a balanced transportation system by providing direct connections and accommodations for automobiles, public transit, bicycles and pedestrians. 
(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 3, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 62.602. - Minimum eligibility requirements. 
    The following are the minimum requirements for a project to be eligible for approval as a PD pursuant to this article: 
(1)  The project site shall contain a minimum of 50,000 or more square feet of land area, excluding any intervening right-of-way and contained entirely within the corporate limits of the City of Vero Beach. 
(2)  Parcels included within a PD shall be contiguous or separated by no more than 70 feet of right-of-way for a road, railroad, canal, or utility. 
(3)  The project site shall be located on or have direct access via a private access road or driveway to an arterial or collector roadway as identified in the comprehensive plan. 
(4)  All land within the PD shall be approved under one development order and all development and all uses within the PD shall be subject to the provisions of the approved development order and any subsequent amendments thereto. 
(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 3, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 62.603. - Application review and approval process. 
    The application submittal, review, and approval process for a PD project and any subsequent amendments shall follow the procedures, review standards, and requirements of this article and chapter 64, article I, development review, and, if required, chapter 77, architectural review, of this part. The applicant shall submit the following additional information with the PD site plan application package: 
(1)  Written documentation of how the proposed project complies with the eligibility requirements of section 62.602 above; and 
(2)  A project justification letter for each development waiver being requested as part of the PD approval and its compliance with the criteria of section 62.606 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 3, 10-15-2013) 
Sec. 62.604. - Conditional use provisions. 
(a)  As a conditional use, a PD project may be permitted by the planning and zoning board, provided the project is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated so that the public health, safety, and welfare are protected. Planned developments shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. Findings made in consideration of a PD are not justification for approval of other planned developments. No inherent right exists to be approved as a planned development. Mere compliance with generally applicable development standards of part III of this Code may not be sufficient, and reasonable additional measures and conditions may be necessary as determined by the planning and zoning board. 
(b)  Neighborhood compatibility, stability and impact on abutting properties shall be of prime importance in consideration of a PD approval. In addition to meeting all other requirements of the Code, the following criteria shall be considered in decision making of the planning and zoning board relative to approval or denial of a PD based on the evidence presented: 
(1)  If the proposed PD will create noise, traffic, odor or other nuisances to a degree that it will be disruptive to abutting or nearby properties, the PD shall not be approved. 
(2)  If the scale of a proposed PD is determined to be inconsistent with existing or anticipated development in the vicinity, the PD shall not be approved. Indicators of scale shall be building bulk and height, open space, and the number of new vehicle trips per day and peak hour. 
(Ord. No. 2013-21, § 3, 10-15-2013)

(h)  Location of off-street parking. 
(1)  All required parking spaces for single family, duplex, and multi-family residential uses shall be located on the same lot or parcel they are intended to serve. 
(2)  Required parking for all other uses shall be located on the same lot as the principal use they are intended to serve or upon another lot in accordance with subsection (i) below. 
(i)  Off-site parking facilities. 
(1)  Notwithstanding the definition of accessory use in chapter 60 of this title, accessory parking for an eligible principal use may be located off-site, if approved pursuant to this chapter. 
(2)  The location of the off-site parking area may be no more than 500 feet walking distance, as measured by the shortest route of effective pedestrian access of a public entrance to the structure or land area to be served, if approved by the planning director. 
(3)  The location of the off-site parking area may be more than 500 feet walking distance, as measured by the shortest route of effective pedestrian access of a public entrance to the structure or land area to be served, if approved by the planning and zoning board. 
(4)  A parking agreement may be required for off-site parking pursuant to section 63.06. 
(5)  Any off-site parking area shall not be located within a residential zoning district except for an approved conditional use located within the same residential zoning district as the off-site parking. 
(6)  Any off-site parking area located within a different zoning district than the principal use it is intended to serve shall meet at least one of the following provisions in addition to the requirements above: 
a.  The zoning district in which the off-site parking is located allows parking lots and garages as a principal use; or, 
b.  The zoning district in which the off-site parking is located allows the principal use intended to be served by the off-site parking and the proposed off-site parking is occupied by a lawfully established principal use; or 
c.  The off-site parking is off-street public parking spaces in a non-residential zoning district, subject to a parking agreement approved by city council.

(Ord. No. 2011-10, § 18, 8-16-2011; Ord. No. 2013-15, § 3, 9-3-2013) 
Sec. 63.03. - Computation of parking spaces. 
    In computing the number of required parking spaces, the following procedures and rules shall govern: 
(a)  Off-street parking space requirements shall be pursuant to the schedule for uses presented in this chapter, except as may be modified elsewhere in this title under the individual zoning districts. 
(b)  Where existing buildings and uses were approved under the parking requirements of a previous ordinance that required less parking than this title, the parking requirements of the less restrictive code shall be applied to those uses and floor area approved under the superseded parking regulations in any change in use or expansion of floor area. This parking computation is to be done on a use by use and floor area by floor area basis. For example, an existing 10,000 square foot building containing 5,000 square feet of retail use and 5,000 square feet of restaurant is to be expanded and redeveloped into a 12,000 square foot building with 3,000 square feet of retail use, a 6,000 square foot restaurant, and 3,000 square feet of office use. Parking for the 3,000 square feet of retail use would be calculated using the parking regulations under which the retail use was originally approved. Parking for 5,000 square feet of the restaurant would be calculated using the parking regulations under which the restaurant was originally approved. Parking for the added 1,000 square feet of restaurant floor area would be calculated based on the current parking regulations. Parking for the office floor space would be calculated based on the current parking regulations. 
(c)  The number of off-street required parking spaces for uses shall be calculated based on the following: 
(1)  Schedule of parking ratios for uses in section 63.04. As applied in section 63.04, floor area is as defined in chapter 60 of this title. 
(2)  Temporary or permanent covered space, such as under an arcade, awning, porch, building overhang or similar structure attached to the building, approved under a site plan for dining or retail sales and services, except that the first 200 square feet of such space is exempt from the parking requirements of this title. Any such covered space of greater than 200 square feet in area is considered floor area and shall be subject to the parking requirements in section 63.04 for restaurant or retail sales and services, as applicable. 
(3)  Outdoor dining and retail sales and services not under cover as described in (2) above, shall be exempt from parking requirements of this title. 
(d)  Where fractional spaces result, the number of spaces required shall be construed to be the next highest whole number. 
(e)  The parking requirement for any use not specified shall be the same as that required for a use of a similar nature as recognized herein. Where not recognized herein, the parking requirement, subject to approval by the planning director, shall be based on criteria in the most current edition of Parking Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or the 21st Century Land Development Code published by the American Planning Association or other appropriate reference document, or a specialized parking study prepared by an applicant for a specific use and site. The specialized parking study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer or transportation planner certified by the American Planning Association. 
(f)  In the case of two or more separate uses are on a site, the parking spaces shall be equal to the sum of the several uses computed separately, except when a shared parking calculation option is used to determine the number of parking spaces pursuant to section 63.05. 
(g)  The required number of off-street parking spaces shall be reduced by the number of on-street parking spaces abutting the property lines of the lot or parcel; however, for properties located within the Ocean Drive/Cardinal Drive Commercial Overlay District, the required number of off-street parking spaces shall be reduced only by the number of privately-built on-street parking spaces abutting the property lines of the lot or parcel.

Sec. 63.05. - Shared parking options. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of shared parking is to allow for a reduction in the total number of on-site parking spaces which would otherwise be required on-site and to provide for meeting off-street parking requirements through use of off-street parking facilities of another use or site. 
(b)  Applicability. Unless specifically limited by other provisions of this title, a shared parking option pursuant to this section may be used to meet the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces where there are two or more establishments or uses with different hours of operation or different hours of peak parking demand, or in situations where surplus parking space is available off-site. 
(c)  General provisions. 
(1)  Any shared parking using off-site parking spaces to meet parking requirements shall comply with the standards for off-site parking in section 63.02. 
(2)  Site plans utilizing any shared parking option based on stipulations in the development order regarding uses, floor area and hours of operation, shall have conditions placed on the approved site plan to ensure compliance with the parking requirements of this title and chapter. Any change in these conditions shall require an amendment to the site plan pursuant to this chapter and title. 
(d)  Shared parking options. The following shared parking options shall be available to meet parking requirements of this title and chapter: 
(1)  Shared parking for on-site uses with different hours of operation based on the shared parking calculation matrix set forth in subsection (e) below. 
(2)  Shared parking for on-site uses based on preparation of a shared parking study prepared in accordance with the methodology recommended in the Shared Parking 2nd Edition or latest edition, published by the Urban Land Institute (ULI). 
(3)  Shared parking using surplus or otherwise available parking spaces off-site. 
(4)  Shared parking using public parking facilities and spaces. 
(5)  Shared parking under a unified site plan without using the shared parking calculation matrix in Table 1 or the ULI methodology. 
(e)  Shared parking using shared parking calculation matrix. The shared parking calculation matrix shown in Table 1 may be applied to calculate the minimum parking requirements in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  Each individual use and floor per use is identified and the minimum parking requirements per use is calculated based on parking standards of this title. 
(2)  The minimum parking requirements for each individual use is then multiplied by the appropriate percentage set forth in the table below for each of the five designated time periods. 
(3)  The resulting calculations for each of the five vertical columns in the table are summed. 
(4)  The minimum parking space requirement is the highest sum among the five vertical columns resulting from the calculation in subparagraph (3) above. Time periods not covered in the matrix below are ignored for purposes of calculating shared parking.

Sec. 64.20. - Existing uses. 
    Any lawful use of land or structures existing on May 16, 1978, and which has become a nonconforming use is hereby declared not to be in violation on May 16, 1978, the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. Such a nonconforming use shall be subject to all of the provisions of this chapter, pertaining to its continuancy, change, and discontinuances. 
(Ord. No. 86-43, § 1, 12-2-1986) 
Sec. 64.21. - Nonconforming use-Extension. 
    The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout any part of a building clearly designed for such use, but not so used at the effective date of this chapter, May 16, 1978. Any nonconforming use which occupies a portion of a building not originally designed or intended for such use shall not be extended to any other part of the building. No nonconforming use may be extended to occupy any land outside the building, nor any additional building on the same plot, not used for such nonconforming use at the effective date of this chapter, May 16, 1978. The nonconforming use of land shall not be extended to any additional land not so used on the effective date of this chapter, May 16, 1978. 
(Ord. No. 86-43, § 1, 12-2-1986) 
Sec. 64.22. - Same-Repair, alteration, enlargement. 
    No structure used for a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered unless the use is changed to one which complies with the provisions of this chapter. Provided that repairs, maintenance, and improvement may be carried out each year in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the assessed value of the building for that year, and provided such work does increase the cubical content of the building nor the floor area devoted to the nonconforming use, nor increase the number of dwelling units. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent compliance with applicable laws or ordinances relative to the safety and sanitation of a building occupied by a nonconforming use. 
(Ord. No. 86-43, § 1, 12-2-1986) 
Sec. 64.23. - Nonconforming structures, alterations, additions. 
    No nonconforming structure (as opposed to a structure used for nonconforming use) shall be added to or altered in a fashion so as to increase the extent to which the structure is in violation of applicable regulations. A nonconforming structure may be added to or altered only if such alteration or addition does not, in itself, constitutes a further violation of existing regulations. 
(Ord. No. 86-43, § 1, 12-2-1986) 
Sec. 64.24. - Reconstruction and additions. 
    In [If] any conforming structure, or building in which there is a nonconforming use, is damaged by fire, flood, explosion, collapse, wind, war, or other catastrophe to such an extent that the cost of rebuilding, repair, and reconstruction will exceed 50 percent of its assessed valuation for the year in which it suffered the foregoing, it shall not be again used or reconstructed for any use except one permitted as a new use in the district in which it is located. For the purposes of this section, conditional uses which are existing or approved as of March 5, 1991, which are no longer included as conditional or permitted uses in that zoning district shall be considered permitted uses and shall be allowed to be reconstructed in the event that any or all of the structure approved for a conditional use is destroyed. Reconstruction shall conform with the current Code of Ordinances and all other development guidelines in effect at the time of reconstruction. 
    Further, small additions to buildings occupied by conditional uses that were existing or approved as of March 5, 1991, may be approved subject to the following: 
(1)  The floor area ratio of the existing building(s) shall not exceed 0.2. Further, any additions to any building(s) shall not result in a floor area ratio that exceeds 0.2. 
(2)  The total additions allowed on a site shall be a maximum of 1,000 square feet. 
(3)  The addition shall not result in the site becoming non-complying with other development guidelines, including the provisions regulating conditional uses.

Sec. 64.25. - Change of nonconforming use. 
    A nonconforming use of land or building shall not be changed to any other use except one which would be permitted as a new use in the district in which the land or building is located. Where a conditional use is made nonconforming by Code changes implemented on March 5, 1991, a change of use shall not occur except within the same use category as originally approved, or to a use that is less intensive based on parking demand, or to a permitted use. If an approved conditional use is changed to a less intensive use, there shall be no prohibition against subsequent changes of use which are of the same intensity of parking as the originally approved use; provided, that the proposed use was listed as a permitted or conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located prior to March 5, 1991.

    Nonconforming structure: A principal or primary structure that was legally permitted at the time of its construction prior to subsequent changes in the code or land development regulations which changes would no longer permit the re-establishment of such structure, including nonconformity with current density, floor area ratio, off-street parking, structure setback, open space, lot coverage, or use area requirements or restrictions. 
    Use area: An area on the premises outside of the primary structure envelope for which a use other than parking was permitted in conjunction with the use of the primary structure at the time the damage occurred that made this section applicable to the structure or premises. 
(b)  Any structure that is nonconforming, by virtue of exceeding, the height limitations of 35 feet as established on April 7, 1987, may be restored to the height previously authorized by the city should such structure be involuntarily destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, explosion, collapse, wind, war, or other sudden catastrophe. 
(c)  The following regulations shall apply and are limited to premises in the C-1A and C-1B commercial zoning districts upon which one or more nonconforming structures exist: 
(1)  Single structure. Upon proof by competent substantial evidence provided to the city that a nonconforming structure is involuntarily destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, explosion, collapse, wind, war, or other sudden catastrophe in excess of 50 percent of the just valuation of the structure, such nonconforming structure may be repaired, reconstructed, or otherwise replaced in similar or different configuration or location on its premises consistent with its pre-damage nonconforming conditions, including any or all nonconformities as to density, floor area ratio, off-street parking, structure setback, open space, lot coverage, and use area requirements or restrictions. 
(2)  Multiple structures. Upon proof by competent substantial evidence provided to the city that one or more structures, on premises with multiple structures thereon, is involuntarily destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, explosion, collapse, wind, war, or similar sudden catastrophe in excess of 50 percent of the total just valuation for all structures on the premises combined, any or all of the structures may be repaired, reconstructed, or otherwise replaced in similar or different configuration or location on the premises whether or not all structures on the premises are nonconforming. Any nonconforming structure existing on such premises may be repaired, reconstructed or replaced on the premises consistent with its nonconforming conditions existing at the time of the damage to the structures on the premises, including any or all nonconformities as to density, floor area ratio, off-street parking, structure setback, open space, lot coverage, and use area requirements or restrictions. 
(3)  Any variances, special exceptions, conditional uses, and licenses previously granted by the city for premises or structures to which this subsection (c) applies shall continue in force to the extent necessary for the redevelopment of the premises or repair, reconstruction or replacement of a structure. An existing variance, special exception, conditional use, license, or nonconformity shall not preclude an application for or approval of an additional or different variance, special exception, or license. 
(4)  Any structure or premises that included retail use on the ground floor at the time of destruction or damage shall retain on the ground floor a minimum of 80 percent of such retail use square footage of the structure or structures being repaired, reconstructed or replaced, or the premises redeveloped pursuant to this subsection (c). 
(5)  Except as provided in this section, any redevelopment of premises or reconstruction or replacement of a structure pursuant to any provision of this subsection (c) shall conform to the land development regulations, Florida Building and Life Safety Codes, flood elevation and flood proofing requirements, Coastal Construction Control Line regulations, applicable Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations, and any other applicable regulation or law in effect at the time of redevelopment of the premises or reconstruction or replacement of the structure. 
(6)  Any redevelopment of premises or reconstruction or replacement of a structure pursuant to any provision of this subsection (c) shall conform to the landscape requirements of the code and the land development regulations to the fullest extent possible. 
(d)  No redevelopment of premises, or repair, reconstruction or replacement of a nonconforming or conforming structure pursuant to any provision of this section shall be permitted that would create an additional nonconformity or increase the extent of any previously existing nonconformity. However, this subsection (d) shall not be interpreted to prohibit the granting of a new or additional variance, special exception, or license upon proper application and approval consistent with the code and the land development regulations. 
(e)  A site plan application and approval through the site plan review process provided in the land development regulations shall be required for redevelopment of premises, or reconstruction or replacement of a structure pursuant to any provision of this section. Repairs that do not alter or otherwise affect the structure location, dimensions, area, or cubical content, or configuration of the structure or premises, as existed pre-damage, shall not require site plan application and review, but may be reviewed administratively. 
(f)  The burden shall be on the applicant to establish by competent substantial evidence the location, dimensions, area and cubical content of a structure as it existed pre-damage. The city may require reasonable supporting information from the site plan applicant, including without limitation, pre-existing and new surveys, copies of pre-existing building plans and proposed building plans, certified copies from the public records of Indian River County, records of the Indian River County property appraiser, affidavits of disinterested witnesses, and any other data or documentation that will reasonably establish the extent of any nonconformity relied upon and the applicant's entitlement to reconstruct such nonconformity, as well as any previously granted variance, special exception, conditional use, or license relied upon by the applicant. 
(g)  Implementation and time limitations. The provisions of this section shall operate to grant the relief provided only if a substantially complete site plan application or a letter of intent to submit a site plan application for proposed reconstruction or redevelopment pursuant to this section is submitted to the planning and development department within one year from the date of adoption of this ordinance or the date the structure or premises damage occurs, whichever date is later. A timely submitted letter of intent shall be deemed to have been abandoned six months after the date of its submittal, unless before then a substantially complete site plan application for the proposed reconstruction or redevelopment has been submitted to the planning and development department for review. One or more extensions of time for periods of not more than six months each may be allowed by the planning and development director for submittal of the site plan application, provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable good cause is demonstrated for such extension of time. 
(h)  The provisions of this section shall govern should any other provision of the code or the land development regulations be in conflict herewith.

Sec. 69.01. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose of this chapter is to more uniformly regulate the size, number, type and location of commercial communication towers, antennas and support facilities. Advances in information technology and the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 are anticipated to generate an increase in the number of requests to site commercial communication support facilities in the City of Vero Beach. The city encourages advances in communication technology that better serve its residents and does not prohibit commercial telecommunication facilities. However, the purpose of the ordinance is to protect city character and public safety by controlling tower location, height, aesthetics, and use of rights-of-way. 
(b)  The intent of this chapter is to accomplish the following: 
1.  Minimize the impacts of wireless communication facilities on surrounding areas by establishing standards for location, structural integrity and compatibility. 
2.  Encourage the location and collocation of wireless communication equipment on existing structures thereby minimizing new visual, aesthetic and public safety impacts, effects upon the natural environment and wildlife, and to reduce the need for additional antenna-supporting structures. 
3.  Accommodate the growing need and demand for wireless communication services. 
4.  Encourage coordination between suppliers of wireless communication services in the city. 
5.  Respond to the policies embodied in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in such a manner as not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless service or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless service in the city. 
6.  Establish predictable and balanced regulations governing the construction and location of wireless communications facilities, within the confines of permissible local regulation. 
7.  Establish review procedures to ensure that applications for wireless communications facilities are reviewed and acted upon within a reasonable period of time. 
(c)  Nothing herein shall limit the rights granted to wireless service providers under Title 47, U.S. Code §151 et. seq; §6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012; F.S. §365.172(13); or any other applicable Federal or state law.

(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984) 
Sec. 71.07. - Public protection and liability.

Sec. 71.10. - Proposed improvements. 
(a)  All improvements to city public rights-of-way shall be made by the City of Vero Beach, or, with permission from the city, by a private party as long as the construction is performed to city standards; provided, however, that in subdivisions in the city such original improvements shall be the responsibility of the developer pursuant to the subdivision ordinance. 
(b)  Improvements by the City of Vero Beach shall be made pursuant to F.S. ch. 170, and as provided in this chapter. 
(c)  Except for the rights-of-way not required to be improved as set forth herein, it shall be the policy of the City of Vero Beach to improve dirt rights-of-way in the city when any of the following happens: 
(1)  When a valid petition is received signed by a requisite number of the property owners of the rights-of-way to be improved. Improvements under this subsection shall be referred to as "petition improvements." 
(2)  When any development occurs which requires site plan approval and which uses a dirt right-of-way for access or which causes increased traffic volume on an adjoining dirt right-of-way. Improvements under this subsection shall be referred to as "site plan improvements." 
(3)  When the city determines that it is in the public interest for a right-of-way to be improved. Improvements under this subsection should be referred to as "city initiated improvements." 
(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984) 
Sec. 71.10.1. - County thoroughfare plan and subdivision or site plan approval. 
    Whenever an application is filed under the subdivision ordinance or for site plan approval and said application includes land which abuts any public right-of-way that is in the "county's thoroughfare plan," the city shall immediately forward a copy of the application to the county for approval of the application as it relates to or impacts the county's thoroughfare plan. The city shall take no action on the application until it receives approval from the county or until 60 days have elapsed from the date of transmission to the county, whichever occurs first. If the application proceeds through the city application process without county approval, then if approval is otherwise in order the application shall be granted on the condition that no building permit shall be issued without county approval as it relates to or impacts the county's thoroughfare plan. 
(Ord. No. 86-21, § 1, 6-17-1986) 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 86-21, adopted June 17, 1986, amended the Code by adding provisions designated as a new § 71.10. Inasmuch as the Code already contains provisions designated § 71.10, the editor, with the consent of the city, has redesignated these new provisions as § 71.10.1. 
Sec. 71.11. - Petition improvements. 
    The land owners abutting a public right-of-way may petition the city to have a right-of-way improved. If the petition is signed by the owners of at least 51 percent of the front footage abutting the public right-of-way in an area proposed for improvement, the city manager shall initiate steps to accomplish the requested improvements pursuant to F.S. ch. 170, and this Code. Funding of such improvements shall be as set forth in section 71.16 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984) 
Sec. 71.12. - Site plan improvements.

Sec. 71.13. - City initiated improvements. 
    Notwithstanding section 71.11, the city council may, on its own motion, determine that improvements shall be made to any public rights-of-way in the city and may assess the costs pursuant to F.S. ch. 170, and section 71.16 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984) 
Sec. 71.14. - Rights-of-way required to be improved. 
    This right-of-way improvement policy shall not be interpreted to require the improving of certain rights-of-way if that paving would result in the destruction of large, well-maintained, and desirable trees, or if rights-of-way which have historical significance or aesthetic appeal which would be ruined by improvement. It shall be up to the discretion of the city council to classify rights-of-way in these categories on an individual basis and the following streets are designated to remain unimproved: 
(a)  Sandfly Lane; 
(b)  Lady Bug Lane; 
(c)  Painted Bunting Lane between Club Drive and Ocean Drive; 
(d)  Camino Del Rio (east and west); and 
(e)  Eugenia Road east of A-1-A. 
    It is the intent of this section that said roads shall remain narrow sand and shell roads, not paved or hard-surfaced, not straightened or widened, or the grade changed, and the city shall do no pruning or removal of trees or plants unless said tree or plant had been determined to be a safety hazard by the city manager or his designee; the pruning shall be guided by standards established by the International Society of Arboriculture. There shall be no installations of any utility poles and sewers along, on, or under same, except that a septic tank effluent pump ("STEP") sewer system may be installed by directional boring methods on the East and West Camino Del Rio right-of-way, and said roads shall remain in their present condition and state as much as possible, and the material used for maintenance shall be sand or shell similar to what is there now.

Sec. 71.15. - Right-of-way lengths. 
    The city shall not improve portions of rights-of-way in increments of less than one city block, or in increments less than that which is economically feasible, whichever is greater. 
(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984) 
Sec. 71.16. - Costs of improvements. 
(a)  Special assessments to cover the cost of improvements shall be levied upon the property specifically benefited by such improvements and in proportion to the benefits to be derived therefrom. Such assessments shall generally be on a front footage or a square footage basis or a combination of the 2 depending on which is the more appropriate or equitable method. Allowable density or actual number of existing units may be used to modify the above methods if appropriate or equitable. 
(b)  Inasmuch as local improvements such as streets and storm sewers generally provide some benefit to the public as a whole, the city, normally, will contribute one-third of the cost with the remainder subject to paragraph (a) of this section. Sanitary sewers do not generally benefit the public as a whole and assessments will normally be in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section only. 
(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984; Ord. No. 87-42, § 2, 6-2-1987) 
Sec. 71.17. - Sidewalk construction. 
    Construction of new sidewalks required by the city shall be made pursuant to F.S. ch. 170; provided, however, that in new subdivisions such improvements shall be the responsibility of the developer pursuant to the subdivision ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984) 
Sec. 71.18. - Sidewalk maintenance, repair, and replacement program-Generally. 
(a)  Except as provided in section 71.18.1 of this chapter, the abutting landowner is responsible for the maintenance, replacement, repair, or removal of that portion of the sidewalk that is in the public right-of-way that abuts the landowner's property. Removal instead of repair may be done only after obtaining permission from the city manager. 
(b)  The city shall give notice to the appropriate landowner if the sidewalk is in disrepair. Notice by mail to the address of the property and to the person in whose name the property is currently assessed as reflected in the records maintained by the city shall be considered sufficient notice. Failure of the city to give such notice shall not relieve the property owner of this obligation to keep the sidewalk in good repair and no cause of action shall exist against the city for any such failure to give notice or from any damages suffered as a result of accidents caused by such sidewalks. 
(c)  The notice shall contain at a minimum the following information: 
(1)  Description of condition which requires repair or replacement; 
(2)  That the owner has a choice of having either the owner or the city do the repair, replacement, or, in some instances, removal of the sidewalk. Repair, replacement, or removal shall be at no cost to the city; 
(3)  That the work is to be completed within 120 days of date of letter; 
(4)  That the owner must notify the city within 60 days of date of letter as to his decision; 
(5)  That if no notification is received within 60 days of the date of the letter, the city will repair, replace, or remove the sidewalk and bill the landowner for costs; 
(6)  That a hearing on the matter may be had before the city manager; 
(7)  That costs incurred by the city in repair, replacement, or removal of a sidewalk, if not paid within 60 days of date of billing, shall be entered in the special assessment lien book maintained by the city. This lien shall bear interest at the highest legal rate permitted by law until paid. 
(d)  Except at a driveway entrance, it shall be a violation of this section to park, stop, or drive any motor vehicle on or over any city-maintained sidewalk. If said violation is observed and the sidewalk is damaged, it shall be considered prima facie evidence that said damage was caused by the motor vehicle in violation of this section. The cost to repair the damage shall be assessed against the owner of the vehicle involved and shall constitute a lien on the real or personal property of the owner of the vehicle involved. 
(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984; Ord. No. 87-42, § 1, 6-2-1987; Ord. No. 87-52, § 1, 8-4-1987) 
Sec. 71.18.1. - Same-Residential dwelling units.

ARTICLE III. - STREET NAMES AND HOUSE NUMBERING 

Sec. 71.19. - Manner prescribed. 
    The city manager shall have the responsibility to approve all street names.

Sec. 71.20. - Official street name. 
    The official street names shall be as they appear on the current official zoning map entitled "City of Vero Beach Zoning Map, Indian River County, Florida." Any new street not included on the official map shall have as its official name the name as it appears on the approved final plat. Certain streets in the airport district have their official name designated in City Ordinance 1099.

Sec. 71.21. - House numbering. 
    The owner or occupant of every building in the City of Vero Beach shall number, or cause to be numbered, that building in accordance with the number assigned by the city manager which shall be consistent with current numbering throughout the city.

Sec. 71.22. - Size and placement of numbers. 
    Numbers shall be not less than 3 inches high and shall be of proportionate width. The numbers should be sufficiently large to be easily read from the opposite side of the street. The numbers shall be placed so as to be clearly visible from the street, generally on, above, or adjacent to the front or garage doors. 
(Ord. No. 84-15, § 1, 7-3-1984) 
ARTICLE IV. - COMMUNICATIONS RIGHTS-OF-WAY 

Sec. 71.23. - Title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Communications Rights-of-Way Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2001-03, § 1, 3-6-2001) 
Sec. 71.24. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city, adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including F.S. § 337.401, as it may be amended, the city's home-rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-way, the city shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(Ord. No. 2001-03, § 2, 3-6-2001) 
Sec. 71.25. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given. Where not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the plural number. The words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Words not otherwise defined shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary meaning. 
    Abandonment shall mean the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used. By way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in public rights-of-way. 
    City shall mean the City of Vero Beach, Florida. 
    Communications services shall mean the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this article "cable service", as defined in F.S. § 202.11(2), as it may be amended, is not included in the definition of "communications services," and cable service providers may be subject to other ordinances of the city. 
    Communications services provider shall mean any person including a municipality or county providing communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. "Communications services provider" shall also include any person including a municipality or county that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications services. 
    Communications facility or facility or system shall mean any permanent or temporary plant, equipment and property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way of the city and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, distribute, provide or offer communications services. 
    FCC shall mean the Federal Communications Commission. 
    In public rights-of-way or in the public rights-of-way shall mean in, on, over, under or across the public rights-of-way. 
    Ordinance shall mean this article. 
    Person shall include any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include the city to the extent the city acts as a communications services provider. 
    Place or maintain or placement or maintenance or placing or maintaining shall mean to erect, construct, install, maintain, place, repair, extend, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A person providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
    Public rights-of-way shall mean a public right-of-way, public utility easement, highway, street, bridge, tunnel or alley for which the city is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface and the area below the surface. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described above and shall not include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. 
    Registrant shall mean a communications services provider that has registered with the city in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
    Registration or register shall mean the process described in this article whereby a communications services provider provides certain information to the city. 
(Ord. No. 2001-03, § 3, 3-6-2001) 
Sec. 71.26. - Registration for placing or maintaining communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(1)  A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(3)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall file a single registration with the city which shall include the following information: 
(a)  Name of the applicant; 
(b)  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant's primary contact person in connection with the registration, and the person to contact in case of an emergency; 
(c)  For registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001, the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service or both; 
(d)  Evidence of the insurance coverage required under this article and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy of this article, which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement; and 
(e)  The number of the applicant's certificate of authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or other federal or state authority, if any. 
(f)  For an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida, such as the number of the certificate from or filing with the Florida Department of State. 
(4)  The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the city engineer or his or her designee. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (3) above, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (3) above, the city shall notify the applicant of the noneffectiveness of registration, and reasons for the noneffectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Noneffectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has 30 days after receipt of a notice of noneffectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 71.30. 
(5)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(6)  Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or to claim priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city, but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(7)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even-numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even-numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd-numbered year immediately preceding such even-numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even-numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (3), except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (3)(c), a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(8)  A permit shall be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(Ord. No. 2001-03, § 4, 3-6-2001) 
Sec. 71.27. - Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within 20 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to reregister. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 4 within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. 
(Ord. No. 2001-03, § 5, 3-6-2001) 
Sec. 71.28. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(1)  A registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state and federal law and city ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the city or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency, and shall or may be required to obtain an after-the-fact permit if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. The city may issue a blanket permit to cover certain activities, such as routine maintenance and repair activities, that may otherwise require individual permits. 
(3)  As part of any permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall provide the following: 
(a)  The location of the proposed facilities shall be referenced to the Florida state planning coordinates and mean sea level datum and shall include a description of the facilities to be installed, where the facilities are to be located, and the approximate size of facilities that will be located in public rights-of-way; 
(b)  A description of the manner in which the facility will be installed (i.e., anticipated construction methods or techniques) and a restoration and repair plan;

No. 2011-11, § 1, adopted August 16, 2011. 

Sec. 73.01. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 2012-27, § 2, 12-4-2012) 
Sec. 73.02. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(a)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(b)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(c)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(d)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(f)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(g)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(h)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(Ord. No. 2012-27, § 2, 12-4-2012) 
Sec. 73.03. - Coordination with the Florida Building Code. 
    This article is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(Ord. No. 2012-27, § 2, 12-4-2012) 
Sec. 73.04. - Warning. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this article.

(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
(h)  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this article or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the planning and zoning board that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and

Consistent with the criteria established by the National Register of Historic Places, the HPC shall recommend for designation places, buildings, structures, landscape features, archaeological sites and other improvements as individual sites, districts, or archaeological zones that are significant in Vero Beach's history, architecture, archaeology, or culture and possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, or association and that meet one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Significant event. Is associated with events that have made significant contributions to the pattern of history in the community, Vero Beach, Indian River County, the state or the nation; 
(2)  Significant person. Is associated with the lives of persons significant in Vero Beach's past; 
(3)  Architectural significance. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of an architectural type, period, style or method of construction; or the work of a prominent designer or builder; or contains elements of design, detail, materials, or craftsmanship of outstanding quality; or represents a significant innovation or adaptation to the South Florida environment; or represents a distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; 
(4)  Archaeological significance. Has yielded, or is likely to yield information in history or prehistory; or 
(5)  Aesthetic significance. Is a part of or related to a landscape, park, environmental feature or other distinctive area, and should be developed or preserved according to a plan based upon a historic, cultural, or architectural motif; or because of its prominent or special location, contrast of siting, age, or scale is an easily identifiable visual feature of a neighborhood or the city and contributes to the distinctive quality of such neighborhood or the city. 
(b)  Multiple properties. For a multiple property nomination, eligibility will be based on the establishment of historic contexts, or themes that describe the historical relationship of the properties. 
(c)  Criteria considerations. Ordinarily cemeteries, birth places, or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the Vero Beach Register of Historic Places. However, such properties will qualify if they fall within the following categories:

(3)  A cemetery that derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; 
(4)  A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan and no other building or structure with the same association has survived; 
(5)  A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; 
(6)  A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance based on National Register of Historic Places criteria; or 
(7)  A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance.

ARTICLE VI. - HISTORIC PRESERVATION AD VALOREM TAX EXEMPTION 

Sec. 76.61. - Authority. 
    Sections 196.1997 and 196.1998, Florida Statutes, authorize the governing authority of any municipality to adopt an ordinance allowing ad valorem tax exemptions under Section 3, Article VII of the State Constitution to historic properties that meet certain requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2010-19, § 2, 7-20-2010) 
Sec. 76.62. - Purpose. 
    The intent of this article is to provide a method by which the city council is authorized to allow ad valorem tax exemptions for the restoration, renovation, or rehabilitation of historic properties. 
(Ord. No. 2010-19, § 2, 7-20-2010) 
Sec. 76.63. - Ad valorem tax exemption for historic properties. 
    Pursuant to F.S. § 196.1997, the city council may grant to eligible properties as defined in section 76.66, a historic preservation ad valorem tax exemption of 100 percent of the assessed value of all improvements that result from the restoration, renovation, or rehabilitation of eligible historic properties, after the council's receipt of a recommendation from the division as provided elsewhere in this article. The exemption only applies to improvements to real property and only to taxes levied by the city council. The exemption does not apply to any taxes levied for the payment of bonds or to taxes authorized by a vote of the electors pursuant to Section 9(b) or Section 12, Article VII, Florida Constitution. In order for the improvements to historic property to qualify for the ad valorem tax exemption, the improvements must have been made on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives (July 20, 2010). All exemptions granted under this article shall be for a term of up to ten years. 
(Ord. No. 2010-19, § 2, 7-20-2010) 
Sec. 76.64. - Ad valorem tax exemption for historic properties open to the public. 
    Pursuant to F.S. § 196.1998, if an eligible property, as defined in section 76.66, is used for a non-profit or governmental purpose and is regularly and frequently open for the public's visitation, use and benefit, the city council may grant to that property an ad valorem tax exemption of 100 percent of the assessed value of the property (as improved) from ad valorem taxes levied by the city provided that the assessed value of the improvement is equal to at least 50 percent of the total assessed value of the property as improved. This section applies only if the improvements are made by or for the use of the existing property owner. In order for the property to qualify for the exemption provided in this section, any such improvements must be made on or after the day the ordinance granting the exemption is adopted. An eligible property is considered used for non-profit or governmental purposes if the occupant or user of at least 65 percent of the usable space of the historic building or of the upland requirement of an archaeological site is an agency of the federal, state or local government or a non-profit corporation whose articles of incorporation have been filed by the department of state in accordance with F.S. § 617.0125. Usable space means that portion of the space within a building which is available for assignment or rental to an occupant, including every type of space available for use of the occupant. For purposes of the exemption under F.S. § 196.1998, a property is considered regularly and frequently open to the public if public access to the property is provided not less than 52 days a year on an equitably spaced basis, and at other times by appointment. This exemption does not prohibit the owner from charging a reasonable non-discriminatory admission fee. If a property that qualifies for this exemption is no longer used for non-profit or governmental purposes or is no longer regularly and frequently open to the public or if ownership is transferred, then this exemption shall no longer be effective and the property shall, instead, be subject to the exemption provided for by section 76.63 above. 
(Ord. No. 2010-19, § 2, 7-20-2010) 
Sec. 76.65. - Term of exemption. 
    Any historic preservation ad valorem tax exemption granted pursuant to this article shall remain in effect for ten years from the effective date of the Historic Preservation Ad Valorem Tax Exemption Covenant entered into by the applicant and the city. The city council shall have the discretion to set a lesser term if requested by the property owner in its original application and covenant. The exemption shall continue in force if the authority of the city to grant exemptions changes or if ownership of the property changes, including any change from a tax exempt entity to a tax paying entity except as set forth in section 76.64 above. In order to retain an exemption, however, the historic character of the property, and improvements that qualified the property for an exemption, must be maintained in the historic state over the period for which the exemption was granted. 
(Ord. No. 2010-19, § 2, 7-20-2010) 
Sec. 76.66. - Properties and construction eligible for ad valorem tax exemption.

If the property is eligible for the ad valorem tax exemption pursuant to this chapter, the planning director shall promptly forward the completed application to the division and a copy to the county property appraiser. If the planning director determines that the subject property is not eligible for ad valorem tax exemption, the application shall be returned to the applicant within 15 days following receipt of the completed application with a cover letter identifying the ineligibility. Any aggrieved party may appeal any final decision of the planning director to the historic preservation commission in accordance with the appeal procedure for administrative appeals in section 64.04 of this part. 
(c)  Application review by the division. Once the division receives the preconstruction application, the division must review the application pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in Rules 1A-38.003 through 1A-38.005, F.A.C., which are hereby incorporated into this article by reference. Written copies of the division's recommendations must be sent to the planning and development department and applicant. If the division's recommendation finds that the proposed work is inconsistent with standards of Rule 1A-38.005, F.A.C., failure of the applicant to correct the planned work, as recommended by the division, may result in denial of the historic preservation ad valorem tax exemption by the city council when the work is finally completed. 
(Ord. No. 2010-19, § 2, 7-20-2010) 
Sec. 76.69. - Request for review of completed work.

For purposes of this section, no application for review of completed work shall be accepted without a certificate of occupancy or certification of completion being issued by the building official for the subject improvements. The planning director shall promptly forward the completed application for review of completed work to the division. 
(b)  Division review of completed work. When the division receives a request for review, the division must review the request pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in Rules 1A-38.003 through 1A-38.005, F.A.C. On completion of its review of a request for review of completed work, the division must recommend to the city council that it grant or deny the historic preservation ad valorem tax exemption. The recommendation and the reasons, therefore, must be provided in writing by the division to the applicant and the planning and development department. A recommendation to grant the exemption constitutes certification by the division that the property for which the exemption is sought meets the requirements of Rules 1A-38.003 through 1A-38.005, F.A.C.

The division's recommendations will advise the applicant of the applicant's right to a fair hearing pursuant to F.S. § 120.57. If the division's recommendation is to deny the ad valorem tax exemption and the applicant timely elects to pursue an administrative appeal under F.S. § 120.57, then the public hearing on the ad valorem tax exemption shall not be scheduled and the city council shall not take action on the application until the final resolution of the appeal. 
(b)  City council action on exemption application. At the scheduled quasi-judicial public hearing, the city council may grant or deny the application for an exemption from ad valorem taxes authorized by this article. The city council shall not consider a tax exemption application prior to receiving a Historic Preservation Ad Valorem Tax Exemption Covenant signed by the property owner required by subsection (d) below. If granted, such exemption shall take effect on January 1 following the substantial completion of the improvement(s). 
    If the historic preservation ad valorem tax exemption is granted by the city council, the ordinance approving the written application for ad valorem tax exemption shall contain the following: 
(1)  The name of the owner, the address of the historic property and the legal description of the property, for which the exemption is granted;
