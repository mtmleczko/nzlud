PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Enterprise, Alabama. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code (and the 1959 Code as indicated), and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of B. Meade White, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to The Honorable Jacquelyn Thompson, Mayor, Danny A. Young, City Clerk-Treasurer, and Mr. Joe Pittman, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    City officials, officers and employees: Whenever reference is made to officials, boards, commissions, departments, etc., by title only, i.e., "mayor," "city clerk," "planning commission," or any other such designation, such references shall be deemed to be to officials, etc., of the city, and powers and authority granted to them shall be deemed to be grants of such powers and authority to their respective duly designated subordinates. 
    Code of Alabama: Whenever reference is made to the "Code of Alabama," "Code of Alabama 1975" or "Alabama Code" it shall mean the Code of Alabama 1975 as amended, or to any subsequent code of this state.

    Jurisdiction: All provisions of this Code and other laws and ordinances of the city prescribing police or sanitary regulations and prescribing penalties for violations thereof, shall have force and effect in the corporate limits of the city and in the police jurisdiction thereof outside of the corporate limits and on any property or rights-of-way belonging to the city, except those provisions, laws and ordinances which specifically limit their force and effect to the corporate limits, or which, for any reason mentioned under the definition of "city" in this section, cannot legally apply in any such area outside of the corporate limits.

Sec. 1-3. - Catchlines of sections. 
    The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section, and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted. 
Sec. 1-4. - Effect of repeal of ordinances. 
(a)  The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinance in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect. 
(b)  The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed under the ordinance repealed. 
(Code 1978, § 1-4) 
Sec. 1-5. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment or decree shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code. 
Sec. 1-6. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-7. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful to change or amend by addition or deletion any part of this Code or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with this Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. 
Sec. 1-8. - General penalty; violations of Code, ordinance, or state law. 
(a)  Any person committing an offense within the corporate limits of the city, or within the police jurisdiction thereof, which is in violation of this Code or any ordinance of the city, now existing or hereafter enacted, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than one dollar ($1.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), and/or may be imprisoned or sentenced to labor for the city for a period not exceeding six (6) months, at the discretion of the court trying the case; provided, however, no penalty shall consist of a fine or sentence of imprisonment exceeding the maximum fine or sentence of imprisonment established under state law for the commission of substantially similar offenses. 
(b)  Any person found to be in violation of subsections 14-1(a), (b) or (c) shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than one dollar ($1.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and/or may be imprisoned or sentenced to hard labor for the City of Enterprise for a period not exceeding six (6) months at the discretion of the court trying the case, unless otherwise provided by subsection (c) below.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section is not intended to limit the authority of the municipal court to impose penalties as set forth in subsection 1-8(b.1) or 14-1(d). 
(b.1)  Any person found to be in violation of this ordinance, where the offense is a misdemeanor listed in Code of Ala., § 11-45-9(d), shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), except where otherwise provided by state law for the violation of municipal offenses, and/or may be imprisoned or sentenced to hard labor for the city for a period not exceeding six (6) months, at the discretion of the court trying the case. Further, the municipal court is authorized to impose the maximum penalties as authorized by Alabama law for offenses and violations which may be imposed by the municipal court.

ARTICLE VIII. - MUNICIPAL VEHICLE POLICY 

Sec. 2-131. - Assignment of vehicles to officials and employees. 
(a)  The city's operational vehicles in kind are authorized for assignment on a full-time basis as determined by IRS regulations. These regulations outline employee transportation rules and employer guidelines for provided transportation. Under these rules, the city shall assign municipal vehicles on a full-time basis for official business, to include to and from work, for use by the following officials and employees: 
(1)  Mayor; 
(2)  Police chief and other designated sworn police officers; and 
(3)  Fire chief. 
(b)  The mayor who is declared the only control official for the city and on a "stand-by status," is assigned a vehicle on a full-time basis and is authorized to use the assigned vehicle for personal use; however, any use of the assigned vehicle for personal purposes will require the mayor to reimburse the city at the rate per mile then in existence for use of private vehicles as set out in the city travel policy as adopted by the city council. Instead of using a city vehicle for use, the mayor may elect to receive a per-month expense reimbursement payment of eight hundred dollars ($800.00) per month for the use of his or her personal vehicle, which amount the city council has determined is in direct proportion to the actual expenses associated with use of said vehicle. After each four-year mayoral term, the per-month expense shall increase in proportion to the average increase of the U.S. Consumer Price Index over the preceding four-year period. The city clerk shall be responsible for calculating the correct increase, if any there be. 
Cross reference- City's travel policy, § 2-121 et seq. 
(c)  The chief public safety officials, the police chief and fire chief, are assigned vehicles on a full-time basis and are authorized to use their vehicles for personal purposes within a 30-mile radius of Enterprise, Alabama. Other sworn police officers are to be assigned vehicles on a full-time basis as designated by the police chief, and are authorized to use their vehicles for personal purposes within the police jurisdiction of Enterprise, Alabama. The vehicles assigned to these officials and employees set out above are exempt under IRS regulations by reason of design, and these officials and employees shall be authorized to use their vehicles for personal purposes for a "de minimis" amount as allowable under IRS regulations. As qualified and allowed under IRS regulations, the minimal personal and commuting use of these "qualified nonpersonal-use vehicles" is treated as a working condition fringe excludable from the employee's income. 
(d)  As a matter of policy, should any official or employee listed above who is assigned a vehicle choose not to use their assigned vehicle for travel to respond to official requirements or should the assigned vehicle or a replacement not be available, they may elect to use their private vehicle for this official purpose and may, upon filing the proper request forms, be reimbursed at the rate per mile then in existence for use of private vehicles as set out in the city travel policy adopted by the city council. 
(e)  Instead of using a city vehicle for use, the mayor may elect to receive a per-month expense reimbursement payment of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per month for the use of his or her personal vehicle, which amount the city council has determined is in direct proportion to the actual expenses associated with use of said vehicle for travel related to his official duties. This shall not preclude the mayor from the use of a city vehicle from time to time for travel related to his official duties. After each four-year mayoral term, the per-month expense shall increase in proportion to the average increase of the U.S. Consumer Price Index over the preceding four-year period. The city clerk shall be responsible for calculating the correct increase, if any there be.

When requirements mandate use of vehicles for official city use during other than normal work hours, a city vehicle will be provided. Should unusual circumstances mandate use of a personal vehicle for city business, that employee shall be reimbursed at the rate per mile as approved in the city travel policy as adopted by the city council.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 6-125. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Code of Ala. 1975 title 11, chapter 19, sections 1 through 24; chapter 45, sections 1 through 11; chapter 52, sections 1 through 84; and title 41, chapter 9, section 166 authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Enterprise, Alabama does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 09-01-09, art. 1, § A, 9-1-09) 
Sec. 6-126. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Enterprise, Alabama, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 09-01-09, art. 1, § B, 9-1-09) 
Sec. 6-127. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(Ord. No. 09-01-09, art. 1, § C, 9-1-09) 
Sec. 6-128. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 09-01-09, art. 1, § D, 9-1-09)

(Ord. No. 09-01-09, art. 4, § B, 9-1-09) 
Sec. 6-148. - Floodways. 
    Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 6-130 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point; 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
(3)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of 44 CFR 65.12, and receives the approval of the Administrator. 
(4)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(5)  Only if subsections (2) through (4) above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 09-01-09, art. 4, § C, 9-1-09)

    Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in section 6-130, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (approximate A-zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 6-130, then the applicant shall provide to the engineering department (floodplain administrator) any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions ([subsections] (2) and (4)) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of section 6-146 and subsections 6-147(1) through (4). 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of subsection 6-147(3)b.(ii) in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 6-146(4) "Elevated buildings." 
The engineering department (floodplain administrator) shall, based on information provided by the applicant, certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 09-01-09, art. 4, § D, 9-1-09) 
Sec. 6-150. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 6-130 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 6-146(4), "Elevated buildings." 
The engineering department (floodplain administrator) shall, based on information provided by the applicant, certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level or two (2) feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 6-141(1)c. and 6-141(2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the engineering department in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of adjustment may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court of Coffee County, Enterprise Division, as provided in Code of Ala. 1975, ;s 11-52-81. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The engineering department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(5)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be: 
(1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or 
(2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
    This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or; 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".

(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 7, 9-4-07) 
Sec. 7-137. - Duty to file report. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of every person subject to such license tax to render to the municipality on such forms as may be required, a sworn statement showing the total business done, amount of sales, gross receipts and gross sales, stock, value of furniture and other equipment, capital invested, number of helpers or employees, amount of space occupied, or other factor described in the schedule, one or several, as the case may require, for the ascertainment of the classification of such person for license taxation purposes and the correct amount of license tax to which he is subject. 
(b)  If the municipality determines that the amount of business license tax reported on or remitted with any business license remittance form is incorrect, if no business license remittance form is filed within the time prescribed, or if the information provided on the form is insufficient to allow the taxing jurisdiction to determine the proper amount of business license tax due, the municipality shall calculate the correct amount of the tax based on the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable and enter a preliminary assessment for the correct amount of business license tax, including any applicable penalties. 
(c)  The municipality shall promptly mail a copy of any preliminary assessment to the taxpayer's last known address by either first-class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested, or, in the sole discretion of the municipality, deliver the preliminary assessment to the taxpayer by personal delivery. 
(d)  If the amount of business license tax remitted by the taxpayer is undisputed by the municipality, or if the taxpayer consents to the amount of any deficiency or preliminary assessment in writing, the municipality shall enter a final assessment for the amount of the tax due, plus any applicable penalty. 
(e)  (1)  If a taxpayer disagrees with a preliminary assessment as entered by the taxing jurisdiction, the taxpayer shall file a petition for review with the municipal license officer within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the preliminary assessment setting out the specific objections to the preliminary assessment. If a petition for review is timely filed, the license officer of the municipality shall schedule a conference with the taxpayer for the purpose of allowing the taxpayer or its representatives and the representatives of the municipality to present their respective positions, discuss any omissions or errors, and to attempt to agree upon any changes or modifications to the assessment. The license officer shall issue findings of fact and law within 60 days following the conference, which shall promptly upon issuance be mailed or delivered to the taxpayer, consistent with the procedures set forth in subsection (d) above. 
(2)  If the taxpayer disagrees with the license officer's findings of fact and law, the taxpayer may appeal to the municipal governing body, by filing a notice of appeal with the municipal clerk within 30 days after the findings have been issued. The appeal shall be in writing and shall set forth in reasonable detail the grounds on which the taxpayer disagrees with the license officer's findings of fact and law. 
(3)  If a petition for review: a. is not timely filed, or b. is timely filed, and upon further review the license officer, or the administrative hearings officer or governing body of the municipality, as the case may be, determines that the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the taxing jurisdiction shall make the assessment final in the amount of business license tax due as computed by the taxing jurisdiction, with applicable penalty. 
(4)  A copy of the final assessment shall promptly be mailed to the taxpayer's last known address: 
(i)  By either first class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of business license tax of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or less, or 
(ii)  By certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of business license tax of more than five hundred ($500.00). 
In either case, at the option of the taxing jurisdiction a copy of the final assessment may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal delivery. 
(5)  A taxpayer may appeal from any final assessment entered hereunder by the taxing jurisdiction by filing a notice of appeal, within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the final assessment, with the license officer, who shall promptly forward a copy of the notice of appeal and related documents to the administrative hearing officer appointed by the taxing jurisdiction to hear appeals of final assessments of the municipality's sales, use, rental, and lodging taxes, as applicable, and business license taxes. The administrative hearing officer shall function in a manner similar to the Administrative Law Judge of the Department of Revenue and must be impartial and reasonably knowledgeable of the business license laws and the taxing jurisdiction's business license code or ordinances. The administrative hearing officer may be an employee of the taxing jurisdiction or otherwise, but in no event shall he or she charge or otherwise be compensated for his or her services in whole or in part based on the portion or amount of the final assessment that he or she determines should be upheld, or any similar contingency. No filing fee or supersedeas bond shall be required by the taxing jurisdiction for such appeals. 
In lieu of the appeal under subdivision to the administrative hearing officer, and at the option of the taxpayer, the taxpayer may appeal from any final assessment hereunder to the circuit court of the county having jurisdiction over the municipality which issued or on whose behalf the final assessment was issued, by filing a notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the final assessment with both the municipal clerk of the municipality and the clerk of the circuit court. If the appeal is to the circuit court, and if the taxpayer is the appealing party, the taxpayer shall also, within the thirty-day period allowed for appeal, either a. pay the business license tax and any penalty shown as due on the final assessment, or b. file a supersedeas bond with the clerk of the court in double the amount of the business license tax and any penalty shown as due on the final assessment, or in such amount as may be required by [Code of Ala. 1975,] § 40-2A-7, as amended from time to time. The supersedeas bond shall be executed by a surety company licensed and authorized to do business in Alabama and shall be conditioned to pay the final assessment and any court costs relating to the appeal. If the taxpayer is the appealing party and is able to show to the satisfaction of the clerk of the court that he or she has a net worth, on the basis of fair market value, of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) or less, including his or her homestead, and that the final assessment is equal to or less than the taxpayer's net worth, the taxpayer may file and prosecute the appeal without either paying the final assessment in full or posting a supersedeas bond. A taxpayer may appeal a final assessment to the circuit court, as provided herein, even though the taxpayer has paid the amount shown as due on the assessment prior to filing the appeal. 
(6)  The filing of the notice of appeal with both the municipal clerk of the municipality and the clerk of the circuit court in which the appeal is filed, as well as the payment of the final assessment in full or the filing of a supersedas bond when required above, are jurisdictional. If such prerequisites are not satisfied within the time provided for appeal, the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal to the circuit court, the final assessment shall be prima facie correct, and the burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to prove the assessment is incorrect. 
(7)  If a final assessment is reduced on appeal, any overpayment shall promptly be refunded to the taxpayer by the taxing jurisdiction to the extent allowed by [Code of Ala. 1975,] § 11-51-192. 
(8)  As provided by [Code of Ala. 1975, §] 11-51-191, no court shall have the power to enjoin the collection of any business license tax due on an assessment so appealed or to suspend the payment thereof. 
(f)  Either the taxpayer or the taxing jurisdiction may appeal to the circuit court from a final order issued by the administrative hearing officer by filing a notice of appeal with the administrative hearing officer and with the circuit court of the county having jurisdiction over the municipality which issued, or on whose behalf the final assessment was issued, within 30 days from the date of entry of the final order. The procedures, presumptions, and related matters and rules shall conform in all material respects to those applicable to appeals from final orders of the Department of Revenue's Administrative Law Division under [Code of Ala. 1975,] § 40-2A-9. 
(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 8, 9-4-07) 
Sec. 7-138. - Duty to permit inspection and produce records.

(b)  To furnish information during reasonable business hours, at the licensee's place of business, in the municipality or the police jurisdiction, all books of account, invoices, papers, reports and memoranda containing entries showing amount of purchases, sales receipts, inventory and other information from which the correct license tax classification of such person may be ascertained and the correct amount of license tax to which he is subject may be determined, including exhibition of bank deposit books, bank statements, copies of sales tax returns to the state, copies of Alabama income tax returns and federal income tax returns.

(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to print, publish, or divulge, without the written permission or approval of the taxpayer, the license form of any taxpayer or any part of the license form, or any information secured in arriving at the amount of tax or value reported, for any purpose other than the proper administration of any matter administered by the taxing jurisdiction, or upon order of any court, or as otherwise allowed in this article. 
(c)  Nothing herein shall prohibit the disclosure of the fact that a taxpayer has or has not purchased a business license. Statistical information pertaining to taxes may be disclosed to the municipal council upon their written request through the city manager or mayor's office. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate the provisions of this section. 
(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 11, 9-4-07) 
Sec. 7-141. - Failure to file assessment. 
(a)  In any case where a person subject to paying a license tax as provided herein fails to do so, the municipal designee shall be authorized to assess and determine the amount of license taxes due using the best information available either by return filed or by other means. 
(b)  The taxpayer shall be notified by registered or certified mail, or by personal service, of the amount of any such assessment, and of his right to appeal not less than twenty (20) days from the date of notice and to show cause why such assessment shall not be made final. 
(c)  If no appeal is made on or before the date fixed in such notice, or if such appeal is not sufficient in the judgment of the municipality, such assessment shall be made final in the amount originally fixed, or in such other amount as is determined by the municipality to be correct. If upon such hearing the municipal designee finds a different amount due than that originally assessed, he/she shall make the assessment final in the correct amount, and in all cases shall notify the taxpayer of the assessment as finally fixed. 
(d)  A notice by the United States mail, addressed to the taxpayer's last known place of business, shall be sufficient. Any assessment made by the designee of the municipality shall be prima facie correct upon any appeal. 
(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 12, 9-4-07) 
Sec. 7-142. - Lien for non-payment of license tax. 
    On all property, both real and personal, used in the business, the municipality shall have a lien for such license, which lien shall attach as of the date when the license is due, as allowed by Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-44. 
(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 13, 9-4-07) 
Sec. 7-143. - Criminal penalties. 
    Any person found guilty of violating any of the provisions of this article shall be fined in an amount not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), and may also be sentenced to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six (6) months, in the discretion of the court trying the case, and violations on separate days shall each constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 14, 9-4-07) 
Sec. 7-144. - Civil penalties. 
    In addition to the remedies provided by Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-150 et seq., the continued or recurrent performance of any act or acts within the corporate limits or within its police jurisdiction for which a license may be revoked or suspended under this article is hereby declared to be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort and convenience of the public and is a nuisance. The municipality, as an additional or alternative remedy, may institute injunctive proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to abate the same. 
(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 15, 9-4-07) 
Sec. 7-145. - Penalties. 
(a)  All licenses not paid within forty-five (45) days from the date they fall due shall be increased by fifteen (15) percent for the first forty-five (45) days they shall be delinquent, or fraction thereof, and shall be measured by an additional fifteen (15) percent for a delinquency of seventy-five (75) or more days, but this provision shall not be deemed to authorize the delay of forty-five (45) days in the payment of the license due, which may be enforced at once. 
(b)  In the case of persons who began business on or after the first day of the calendar year, the license for such "new business" shall be increased by fifteen (15) percent for the first fifteen (15) days they shall be delinquent, and shall be measured by an additional fifteen (15) percent for a delinquency of forty-five (45) days or more.

(c)  If said applicant desires to appear before the municipal governing body to show cause why said license should be issued, he shall file a written notice with the municipal clerk, said notice to be filed within two (2) weeks from the date of mailing by the municipal clerk of the notice of the denial of such license by the municipal governing body.

(e)  The applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear personally, or through his counsel, or both, and the municipal governing body shall proceed to hear any evidence which may be presented both for and against the issuance of said license. 
(f)  If the municipal governing body determines from the evidence presented that in order to either provide for the safety, preserve the health, promote the prosperity, or improve the morals, order, comfort and convenience of the inhabitants of the municipality said license should not be granted, it shall enter an order to that effect; otherwise, said license shall be ordered issued upon payment of any required license fees. 
(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 1,8 9-4-07)

(a)  Any lawful license issued to any person to conduct any business shall be subject to revocation by the municipal governing body for the violation by the licensee, his agent, servant, or employee of any provision of this article or of any ordinance of the municipality, or any statute of the state relating to the business for which such license is issued; and shall also be subject to revocation by the municipal governing body if the licensee, his agent, servant, or employee under color of such license violates or aids or abets in violating or knowingly permits or suffers to be violated any penal ordinance of the municipality or any criminal law of the state; and shall also be subject to revocation by the municipal governing body if, in connection with the issuance or renewal of any license, the licensee or his agent filed or caused to be filed any application, affidavit, statement, certificate, book, or any other data containing any false, deceptive or other misleading information or omission of material fact. 
(b)  The conditions hereinabove set forth as grounds for the revocation of a license shall also constitute grounds for refusing to renew a license.

(Ord. No. 08-21-07, § 1, 9-4-07) 
Sec. 7-149. - Refunds on overpayments. 
(a)  Any taxpayer may file a petition for refund with the municipality for any overpayment of business license tax erroneously paid to the municipality. If a final assessment for the tax has been entered by the municipality, a petition for refund of all or a portion of the tax may be filed only if the final assessment has been paid in full prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the petition for refund. 
(b)  A petition for refund shall be filed with the municipality within two years from the date of payment of the business license tax, which is the subject of the petition. 
(c)  The municipality shall either grant or deny a petition for refund within six (6) months from the date the petition is filed, unless the period is extended by written agreement of the taxpayer and the municipality. The taxpayer shall be notified of the municipality's decision concerning the petition for refund by first class U.S. mail or by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, sent to the taxpayer's last known address. It the municipality fails to grant a full refund within the time provided herein, the refund petition shall be deemed to be denied. 
(d)  If the petition is granted or the municipality or a court otherwise determines that a refund is due, the overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer by the municipality. If the municipality determines that a refund is due, the amount of overpayment due thereon may first be credited by the municipality against any outstanding tax liabilities due and owing by the taxpayer to the municipality, and the balance of any overpayment shall be promptly refunded to the taxpayer. If any refund or part thereof is credited to any other tax by the municipality, the taxpayer shall be provided with a written detailed statement showing the amount of overpayment, the amount credited for payment to other taxes, and the resulting amount of the refund. 
(e)  A taxpayer may appeal from the denial in whole or in part of a petition for refund by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the municipality denying the petition for refund is located. Said notice of appeal must be filed within two years from the date the petition was denied. The circuit court shall hear the appeal according to its own rules and procedures and shall determine the correct amount of refund due, if any. If an appeal is not filed with the appropriate circuit court within two years of the date the petition was denied, then the appeal shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

Sec. 8-15. - Deferred prosecution program established. 
    The Alabama Legislature has for many years, through bills of statewide application and local bills, provided for the possibility of rehabilitative treatment in lieu of undergoing prosecution. The theory behind such legislation is that a criminal conviction imposing a fine or jail sentence may not be as beneficial to society as a program designed to rehabilitate the accused in a manner that may avoid future offenses. It is the belief of this council that this theory is sound and supported by affirmative results. The council hereby establishes a program of deferred prosecution which does not provide a right to the accused but such program provides a privilege to those granted admission based upon the guidelines and rules herein established. 
(Ord. No. 04-07-09, § 1, 4-21-09) 
Sec. 8-16. - Administration.

The said records shall be kept and maintained separate and apart from all other municipal court records except for cross references to the applicant's original offense file.

Sec. 8-17. - Admission into program.

(1)  Deferred prosecution shall be available only one (1) time for the same or similar offense. Deferred prosecution will not be available if the applicant has any prior alcohol, drug or domestic violence conviction from any jurisdiction. Deferred prosecution will not be available if the accused was granted youthful offender status for any prior alcohol, drug or domestic violence arrest. 
(2)  In alcohol or drug cases, the deferred prosecution must include, at a minimum, the enrollment in a level II alcohol or drug rehabilitation program approved by the court referral officer. 
(3)  If there are any companion traffic cases with a DUI arrest, the accused must plead guilty and settle those cases as a prerequisite to being eligible to apply for deferred prosecution of the DUI case. 
(4)  The accused must complete a deferred prosecution application form containing such information as the prosecutor determines to be needed and appropriate. 
(5)  Deferred prosecution will not be available for any offense involving serious injury to a person. 
(Ord. No. 04-07-09, § 3, 4-21-09) 
Sec. 8-18. - Recommendation, approval required. 
    In order to participate in the program, an applicant must receive the affirmative recommendation of the prosecutor. Final approval for participation shall be at the discretion of the Enterprise Municipal Judge, hereinafter referred to as "judge".

Sec. 8-20. - Application information. 
    Prior to being admitted to the program or as part of the prosecutor's evaluation process, an applicant may be required to furnish information concerning past treatment or care received, psychological tests taken, and any other information concerning the applicant which the prosecutor believes has a bearing on the decision as to whether or not the applicant should be admitted to the program. 
(Ord. No. 04-07-09, § 6, 4-21-09)

An applicant may not be denied access into the program based solely on his or her inability to pay. Program fees as established by this Act may be waived or reduced for just cause, including indigency of the applicant, at the discretion of the judge. Any determination of indigency of the applicant for the purposes of deferred prosecution fee waiver or reduction shall be made by the judge. A schedule of payments for any of these fees may be established by the prosecutor. 
(b)  The following fees shall be applied to applicants accepted in the program:

Thereafter, once the hauling vehicle is loaded with septic waste or grease, the loaded weight of the hauling vehicle will be weighed on the scales immediately before the hauler brings the load to the new facility referenced in section 13-146. The hauler will present a certified ticket showing the empty weight and the loaded weight each time it desires to unload the waste/grease. The hauler shall be charged the difference between the loaded weight and the empty weight based on the rate of eighty dollars ($80.00) per one thousand (1,000) gallons. It will be assumed that a gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds and this will be used as a base line in the calculation for determining the charge to the hauler. The Director of public works is empowered to periodically take samples of the septic waste and grease to be disposed after this article is enacted and makes reasonable adjustments to the assumed weight per gallon based on the results of the samples. The city will accept weight certifications obtained from Sessions Company, Coffee County Co-Op, Coffee County Gin Co., Trading Depot and other persons or entities after obtaining prior approval from the director of public works. 
(b)  Haulers shall be charged eighty dollars ($80.00) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of waste/grease but costs may increase depending on future circumstances, including but not limited to, overtime labor requirements (add twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per one thousand (1,000) gallons), further ADEM mandates. The director of public works is empowered to assess such increases as are needed; 
(c)  The city will accept septic waste generated from within Coffee County but will only accept grease generated within the city limits of Enterprise; and, 
(d)  Once the new treatment facility referenced in section 13-146 is operational, it will be open for business Monday through Friday; 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. except that on Fridays it will remain open until 6:00 p.m. if the public works office is notified by the hauler prior to 4:30 p.m. These hours of operation are subject to change.

(a)  For purposes of this section, the term "vacancy" or "vacant position" applies to either an existing, nonentry level position that is permanently vacant due to the death, retirement, promotion, transfer, resignation, or the like of the incumbent or nonentry level, newly created position. The term "vacancy" as used in this policy, does not include positions only temporarily vacant; for example, positions where the incumbent is on vacation, leave of absence or suspension. In all cases, the city reserves the right to determine when a vacancy exists based on the needs of the city. Shift preferences are not considered vacancies or promotional opportunities and are not covered by this policy. The term "promotion" means the change of an employee from a position in one class to a vacant position in another class having a higher pay grade and requiring the performance of more responsible duties. 
(b)  Announcements for vacancies in the police department and fire department will be made through the director of human resources and applications will be taken in the human resources department as with any other city position opening. All vacancies occurring in the classified service for the police department and fire department shall be advertised only internally unless it is deemed by the respective heads of the police department and fire department, as the case may be, and upon consent of the mayor, that applicants should be procured outside the respective departments, in which case, the director of human resources may recruit applicants from outside the respective departments. If it is determined that applicants should be procured from outside the respective departments, then only those applicants who are employed with departments within agencies who serve at least twelve thousand (12,000) in population shall be considered. 
(c)  The criteria used in the selection of the most qualified applicant shall be based on job descriptions, written examinations, performance appraisals, length of service, education levels and, if applicable to an applicant, then oral examinations. Job descriptions shall be approved by the respective chiefs referenced herein and the mayor and maintained by the director of human resources. 
(d)  Applicants must meet the minimum qualifications as described in the job description as formulated by the respective department head and the human resources director. Nothing herein modifies, supersedes or amends the current job descriptions in existence as to the positions in the respective departments. 
(e)  The job experience of the applicant must be equivalent or higher than the requirements in the job description for the position sought. 
(f)  Applicants must have no suspensions within six (6) months of the position announcement closing date (which shall be the date of the written documentation of suspension, rather than the actual dates suspended). 
(g)  Applicants must submit a fully completed written application by the deadline posted in the vacancy announcement to the human resources department. 
(2)  Promotion criteria. After appropriate job descriptions and minimum qualifications are procured by the respective chiefs of the departments referenced herein, in consultation with the director of human resources, and with the approval of the mayor, and appropriate announcements are advertised in accordance with this section, and a review of completed applications is made by the human resources department to determine if the applicant meets minimum qualifications, the following criteria shall apply to applicants: 
(a)  Written examinations. The director of human resources, in consultation with the chief of police or the chief of the fire department, as the case may be, shall procure a written examination for applicants which tests the applicant's general knowledge and abilities related to the respective department's general purposes and work. Said written exam shall account for twenty-eight (28) percent of the score of the applicant. The written examinations shall remain under seal in the possession of the director of human resources until given. The director of human resources shall administer the exam, retain the exam after administration, and forward the same to the testing company for scoring. 
(b)  Performance appraisals. The chief of police or the chief of the fire department, as the case may be for the respective department, in consultation with the director of human resources, shall review and judge the applicant as to performance appraisals which shall be based on the applicant's prior job performance and service within the respective department, or if an applicant outside the department is accepted, that applicant's prior job performance record. The performance appraisal criteria shall consist of the average of the last four (4) performance appraisals of the applicant, unless the applicant has not been employed long enough to have four (4) performance appraisals, in which case it will be an average of existing performance appraisals. Performance appraisals shall account for thirty-five (35) percent of the score of the applicant. If a proper application is submitted by an applicant from outside the respective department, then said applicant must present a signed consent which authorizes the director of human resources to obtain their performance appraisals from the department(s) where he or she is employed or was previously employed. 
(c)  Length of service. Applicants shall be awarded points based on length of active service within the respective department(s) (if applicant is from outside the department and has worked for another or other departments, then the applicant's total length of service therein shall be credited). If the application process is only open to applicants from within the department, the length of active service will be credited based on the applicant's current, continuous, uninterrupted, and satisfactory service within the department (previous employment with the city will not count), but in the event the application process is open to applicants outside the department, then the length of active service as to all applicants will be credited based on the applicant's total length of active service as a certified peace officer or certified firefighter by departments within agencies that serve at least twelve thousand (12,000) in population. If the applicant process is opened to applicants outside the department, then all applicants shall be responsible to procure documented and properly certified proof of prior service from his or her current or past employer(s). 
Applicants shall be awarded one (1) point per year for a maximum of ten (10) points. Therefore, the length of service criteria shall account for ten (10) percent of the applicant's score. If the applications are allowed to be taken from outside the department, then such applicants shall be awarded the same number of points for a maximum of ten (10) points for active service with departments within agencies who serve at least twelve thousand (12,000) in population.

Masters degree in field related to department work-Four (4) points. 
Doctorate degree in field related to department work-Five (5) points. 
    Points shall be awarded only for the highest degree attained, not multiple degrees; for example, an applicant cannot get two (2_ points for an AS degree and three (3) points for a BS, for a total of five (5) points. The education level criteria shall account for five (5) percent of the applicant's final score. 
(e)  Oral board. The chief of the respective departments shall procure an oral board interview for the applicants whose scores rank in the top eight (8) of all applicant scores. Said oral board criteria shall account for twenty-two (22) percent of the applicant's final score. However, oral board interviews will be conducted only with the top eight (8) subtotaled applicant's scores consisting of the written exam, performance appraisals, length of service, and education criteria. If any applicant scores a tie with the applicant ranked eighth, then that applicant(s) shall be allowed to proceed to the oral board. 
(f)  [Rankings.] The respective chiefs, in consultation with the director of human resources, shall procure a final list of rankings [which] will rank the applicants' total scores consisting of the written exam, performance appraisals, length of service, education, and the oral board interviews. The final list in ranking order will remain in effect for one (1) year from the date the list is completed if sufficient internal applicants have made the final list of rankings, unless the list is exhausted in less than one (1) year. If an applicant is suspended or otherwise suffers disciplinary action while on an active list, the applicant may be removed from the list. (Applicants from outside the respective department(s) shall provide a signed consent authorizing the director of human resources to contact and obtain information and documentation from current or former employers confirming any history, or absence thereof, of suspensions or disciplinary action). 
(g)  [Selection.] Successful applicants shall be selected by the respective Chiefs from the final list according to their rank in score. If the application process has not been opened to applicants outside the department, and if applicants receive final, identical scores, then the applicant with the most total years of current, continuous, uninterrupted, satisfactory service within the department shall have priority. If the application process has been open to applicants outside the department, and an applicant inside the department and an applicant outside the department receive final, identical scores, priority shall go to the applicant within the department. If only outside applicants receive identical final scores, then the applicant with the most total years as a certified peace officer or certified fire fighter in a department within agencies that serve at least twelve thousand (12,000) in population shall be given priority. 
(h)  [Equal opportunity policies.] The respective chiefs of the departments referenced herein, in consultation with the director of human resources, shall cause, and apply, all aspects of the promotion criteria set forth above so that they will meet applicable equal opportunity policies previously adopted by the city, including, but not necessarily limited to, the policy that employment decisions shall be made without regard to sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age, or disability.

(Ord. No. 5-17-88-A, § 3.3, 6-14-88) 
Sec. 18-20. - Same-Regulations and requirements. 
    The regulations and requirements for the construction of frontage (service) roads are as follows: 
(1)  Purpose and intent: The purpose of this section is to accommodate business, commercial or residential development along Alabama 192. Generally development along this highway will be of a nature oriented to heavy accessibility to adjacent properties, minimize ingress and egress points, preserve road capacity, maintain smooth traffic flow, and to minimize safety hazards and other undesirable characteristics of highway type developments. It is intended to perform these functions during the time period that this highway is two-lane and to further provide for its expected future four-lane development. 
(2)  General requirements: The following general requirements will apply to all development and/or construction along Alabama 192. 
a.  Frontage (service) roads shall be required along the entire property frontage. All frontage roads shall be for two-way traffic, parking will not be allowed. Such frontage roads may be constructed on state highway department right-of-way, provided that prior approval has been obtained from that department. At the option of the site review committee, or planning commission as appropriate, developers may be relieved from providing frontage roads across drainage ditches, creeks and other natural features where due to the topography or terrain completion would not be feasible. 
b.  All frontage roads, whether located on state highway right-of-way or on private property, shall be constructed to state highway department specifications. The state highway department will accept maintenance of the frontage roads only if they are built to their specifications and located on public right-of-way. 
c.  All frontage roads shall meet the following minimum requirements in addition to the specifications required by the state highway department: 
1.  Permanent access from the frontage road to Alabama 192 or any intersecting road shall not be any closer to the intersection than six hundred (600) feet. 
2.  Permanent access curb cuts from the service road to Alabama 192 shall begin or end not closer than eight hundred (800) feet from the beginning or ending of another permanent curb cut. 
3.  Temporary access may be allowed from the frontage road to Alabama 192 until permanent access points can be constructed or connections made to existing access points. 
4.  Frontage roads stubouts shall be provided at adjoining property boundaries. 
d.  At the option of the site review committee, or planning commission as appropriate, the developer may be permitted to post surety bond in lieu of construction for a required frontage road fronting his development. The developer must then deliver and maintain with the city a bond executed by the developer and by some surety company authorized to do business with the city. This bond shall: 
1.  Be payable to the city in a sum determined by the director of the city engineering department as being sufficient to cover the actual cost of construction of an approved frontage road fronting the property for which the bond is issued. 
2.  Be for a term of one (1) year from date of acceptance, with the developer having the option to renew annually with the approval of the state review committee or planning commission, as appropriate. Each renewal shall be subject to the review of the director of the city engineering department so as to determine any adjustments required to ensure that the bond as renewed, will continue in a sum adequate to cover the actual construction costs of such service road. 
3.  Become payable, when in the opinion of the director of the city engineering department, construction is required so as to continue frontage roads constructed on adjoining property.

--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- In accordance with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules for rate regulation as established herein, these administrative regulations of the City of Enterprise for regulation of basic cable service and equipment rates ("administrative regulations"), attached to Ord. No. 01-20-04-A as exhibit A, establish the original local rules for rate regulation. These administrative regulations clarify steps necessary for all parties to comply with new FCC rules and applicable local rules established timeliness for administrative review and necessary action regarding the regulation rates. (For purposes of these regulations, the words "licensee" and "franchisee" shall mean the same as the franchisee who has been granted nonexclusive franchise rights in the city.) 
The administrative regulations set forth below are intended to be consistent with FCC regulations and applicable local law governing the regulation of basic cable service and equipment rates. A franchise is prohibited from engaging in any activity that is prohibited under FCC rules, as if those rules were set out here in full. If any parts of these administrative regulations are pre-empted because of changes in FCC rules, changes will be incorporated herein, and other provisions will remain in force. The city may also amend the administrative regulations as appropriate to clarify the rules for regulating rates. Furthermore, it is intended that these regulations incorporate applicable federal, state and local laws which may give city additional rights. 

Sec. 18.5-75. - General rules for rate regulations. 
(1)  Once basic rate regulation has begun, a franchise must initially justify its existing rates and thereafter justify any increases or new rates for basic service and equipment in accordance with FCC rules. 
(a)  Subject to FCC rules governing burden of proof, it is the franchisee's responsibility to show that its rates are reasonable. 
(b)  A franchisee must justify rates for basic service and equipment for all classes of customers. 
(c)  Except as FCC rules may otherwise provide, once a licensee has been notified by the city that its rates are subject to regulation, it may not increase rates for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the city except as provided by FCC rule regulations. This requirement applies in all cases, including announced increases rates that were not implemented before rate regulation began. 
(2)  Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed with the city as specified in 47 C.F.R. § 76.933. This requirement does not eliminate or alter any other local requirement for notices that may apply. 
(3)  The licensee is required to notify the city in writing of intended rate changes at least sixty (60) days prior to the date the change is proposed to become effective. This notice is separate and different for a formal rate filing, and is not limited to regulated service. 
(4)  If a licensee is required to produce information it believes is proprietary, it may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request may state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality may be granted if the city council determines that the preponderance of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, and Alabama law. 
(Ord. No. 01-20-04-A, § 1(Exh. A, § 1), 3-2-04) 
Sec. 18.5-76. - Submission of rates filings. 
(1)  A rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the date the rate filing and all required copies (including all supporting materials) are received by the city via service on the city clerk. 
(a)  Three (3) copies of the rate filing must be submitted to the city clerk. 
(b)  One (1) copy of the rate filing must be submitted to the city attorney. 
(c)  If a licensee claims that any material filing is proprietary, that material must be stamped "proprietary", and separated from other material in each of the four (4) copies of the filing. Each page of the proprietary information must contain a page number and any other description needed to show where it belongs within the public portion of the filing. The public portion of the filing must show each place where proprietary information was omitted. 
(d)  In addition, a fifth complete copy that does not omit the proprietary information must by submitted to the city clerk if the operator claims its filing contains proprietary information. This copy must be clearly marked on the first page "Contains Proprietary Information". 
(2)  Except as inconsistent with FCC rules, every filing must include the following components. 
(a)  A cover letter stating whether the filing justifies existing rates or proposes an increase in rates. The letter must identify any proposed rate that is based, in whole or in part, upon cost of service, inflation adjustment, or alleged increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain a brief narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in services. 
(b)  Copies of all applicable FCC forms, which must be correctly competed. 
(c)  The pages of each rate filing must be sequentially numbered. 
(d)  If different rates are proposed for basic service for different classes of subscribers, the filings must show that the classifications and the differences in rates changed are reasonable and consistent with federal law. Changes in bulk rates must also be reported. 
(Ord. No. 01-20-04-A, § 1(Exh. A, § 2), 3-2-04) 
Sec. 18.5-77. - Initial review and public comment. 
(1)  Public comment by interested parties is allowed and encouraged. After receiving a rate filing, the city clerk shall issue an appropriate notice stating that the filing is available for public review and written comment by interested parties and giving deadlines for the submission of those comments. The city clerk or his designee may also accept any informal letters and telephoned comments or complaints from licensee's subscribers as public comment. 
(2)  Based on written comments, subscriber comments, the licensee's filings and responses, and applicable federal rules or benchmarks, the city clerk may issues a preliminary written recommendation to the city council regarding the rate filing. 
(3)  The administrative recommendation shall describe the reasons for the same and actions as required under FCC rules, with recommendations for: 
(a)  Approval of the rate; or 
(b)  Prescribing a different rate; or 
(c)  Tolling the proposed rates in whole or in part; or 
(d)  An additional period of time for review and action on the filing; or 
(e)  Any combination thereof as appropriate under FCC rules. 
(4)  The city clerk's preliminary recommendation will be submitted in time for the city council to take formal action as specified in 47 C.F.R. § 76.922. 
(5)  The city clerk's preliminary recommendation will be submitted in time for the city council to take formal action as specified in 47 C.F.R. § 76.922. 
(Ord. No. 01-20-04-A, § 1(Exh. A, § 3), 3-2-04) 
Sec. 18.5-78. - City council review and action. 
(1)  After review of the supplementary information, public comments, and city clerk's recommendations, the city council shall render a written order, consistent with 47 C.F.R. § 76.933, which may be in any lawful form: 
(a)  Approving the proposed rates in whole or in part; 
(b)  Denying the rate in whole or in part; 
(c)  Approving a rate different from the one proposed by the licensee; 
(d)  Allowing the rates to go into effect, subject to further review; 
(e)  Any combination thereof. 
(2)  The city's written orders will be issued within time limits established by the FCC rules. 
(Ord. No. 01-20-04-A, § 1(Exh. A, § 4), 3-2-04) 
Sec. 18.5-79. - Licensee's duties. 
(1)  A licensee must implement remedial requirements within thirty (30) days of the date an order issues mandating a remedy. 
(2)  Within ninety (90) days of the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a licensee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of the cable company stating whether the licensee has complied fully with all provisions of the relevant order. 
(3)  It is each licensee's responsibility to keep the books and records of account. 
(4)  It is each licensee's duty to submit as complete a filing as possible. 
(5)  A licensee must respond to requests for information within deadlines established by the city council. 
(6)  Because federal law limits the time available for an initial response to a rate filing by a licensee, a licensee must be prepared to respond promptly and within no more than fourteen (14) days to information requests made by the city council by and through the city clerk. 
(Ord. No. 01-20-04-A, § 1(Exh. A, § 5), 3-2-04) 
Sec. 18.5-80. - Provisions generally applicable to rate orders. 
(1)  Every rate order shall be made available to the public and the licensee. To the extent required FCC rules, orders must be in writing and explain the bases for a decision. In addition to the rate order's publication in the city, the city clerk may also publish a notice (in compliance with 47 C.F.R. § 76.936(b)) stating that the order has been issued and is available for review. 
(2)  The city council may take any action permitted under applicable law, including, but not limited to, setting rates and ordering refunds. 
(3)  To the extent required by FCC rules, any order prescribing a rate (i.e. setting a rate different from the one proposed) must explain why the licensee's proposed rate was unreasonable and why the rate prescribed rate is reasonable. 
(4)  Before such a rate is prescribed or a refund to subscribers ordered, a licensee shall be given notice and opportunity to comment on the prescribed rate as described above.

The police department will be furnished a list of towing service personnel and their name, address, date of birth, driver license number and social security number. An agent of the department will conduct a criminal background and driver history check of all listed individuals. If the conviction of a felony or misdemeanor would otherwise disqualify the applicant from being placed on the towing rotation list occurred more than ten (10) years ago and the applicant has demonstrated acceptable behavior complying with legal and ethical standards of the community; then, after complete investigation by the chief of police or his designate, the applicant may be considered for placement on the rotation list. This decision is at the discretion of the chief of police. The burden of persuasion shall be on the applicant making the request. 
Force, violence and moral turpitude are defined as follows: 
Force is defined as power, violence, compulsion or constraint exerted upon or against a person or thing. Force may be deadly or non-deadly but is unlawful unless privileged by law. 
Violence is the unjust or unwarranted exercise of force, usually with vehemence, outrage or fury; the exertion of any physical force so as to injure, damage or abuse. 
Moral turpitude signifies an inherent quality of baseness, vileness or depravity in private or public duties which a man owes to his fellow man or to society in general. In its simplest form, moral turpitude is conduct contrary to justice, honesty, modesty or good morals. 
    Many states, including Alabama, have established a list of crimes which have been judicially held to exhibit moral turpitude. Conviction of one or more of these crimes would be held as prima facie evidence of moral turpitude. However, the list is not to be considered all inclusive nor should the fact an individual was convicted of a felony be automatically assumed to exhibit moral turpitude as compared to a misdemeanor conviction. It is not always necessary to be convicted of one of the listed crimes to fall within the definition of moral turpitude if it can be established by clear and convincing evidence that the individual exhibits a lack of moral character and such character defect would reasonably prohibit the individual from being placed on the rotation list. 
Crimes held to involve moral turpitude: 
a.  Adultery. 
b.  Assault with intent to murder. 
c.  Attempted theft. 
d.  Battery upon a police officer. 
e.  Bigamy. 
f.  Bribery. 
g.  Burglary. 
h.  Buying and concealing stolen property. 
i.  Carnal knowledge. 
j.  Conspiracy to commit a crime held to involve moral turpitude. 
k.  Desertion from military in time of war. 
l.  Embezzlement. 
m.  Forgery. 
n.  Fraud. 
o.  Hit and run/leaving the scene of an accident. 
p.  Tax evasion. 
q.  Larceny (grand/petit). 
r.  Mail fraud. 
s.  Making false statement of a crime. 
t.  Manslaughter. 
u.  Murder.

ARTICLE V: - SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Section 1. - (C-O) Highway Corridor Overlay District. 
    Recognizing the special nature of certain thoroughfares and the direct and indirect impacts of the appearance of these roadways and their importance to the local economy, this section sets forth regulations that will help ensure that development in these critical areas is visually pleasing and economically viable. This section applies to all land in the corridor, regardless of the underlying zoning district designation, and supersedes base district zoning district regulations in the corridor unless the zoning district requirements are more stringent. In those cases, the base district regulations apply. Henceforth, as parcels are developed or redeveloped along designated corridors, the following buffer yard, landscape and sign requirements shall apply. The Planning Commission and the City Council shall treat all developments in this District as subject to review using the procedures outlined for Conditional Uses in Article XIII, Section 5. 
    These regulations shall apply to all B-3 (Highway Business Districts) and to all lots, parcels and tracts that have frontage upon the following Highways: 27, 84, 134, 167, 192 and 248. 
a.  Building Materials. All building cladding materials on facades visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic shall incorporate natural materials such as wood or stone and/or manufactured materials such as brick and stucco. 
b.  Buffer yards and Setbacks. A fifteen (15) foot buffer yard shall be installed along the front property line. This buffer yard shall contain ten (10) understory trees and fifteen (15) shrubs per every one hundred (100) feet of frontage. In addition, five (5) canopy trees shall be planted throughout the balance of the site for every one hundred (100) feet of frontage. 
Buffer yards of a minimum width of five (5) feet shall be installed along all side and rear property lines. Each such buffer yard shall contain four (4) understory trees and six (6) shrubs per every one hundred (100) feet of property line. 
All structures shall be set back at least twenty (20) feet from the right-of-way line. All garages, car washes or other service bays shall be located at least forty (40) feet from the front property line; and all garage, car wash, or service bay openings shall be oriented at not less than ninety (90) degrees to the primary street frontage. 
Dumpsters and all other refuse collection devices shall be located behind the front plane of the principal structure and shall be fully screened from public view. 
c.  Landscaping. All developments in this District shall provide general landscaping on the site in addition to that required in the buffer yards. A minimum of three (3) canopy, three (3) understory, and fifteen (15) shrubs shall be provided for every three hundred (300) total linear feet of perimeter of buildings on the site. 
No more than twenty (20) contiguous (side-by-side) parking spaces shall be constructed without a landscaped island. At least half of such islands shall be at least nine (9) feet wide; the remainder shall be at least four and one-half (4.5) feet wide. All such islands shall contain at least one (1) understory or canopy tree. The Planning Commission may count such trees against the general landscaping requirement. 
All sites shall be developed in such a way that significant existing vegetation is preserved and incorporated into the landscaping of the site. 
d.  Signs. All signs shall be coordinated as to design and materials with the design and materials of the structures on the site. 
All freestanding signs shall have any metallic structural elements (i.e., poles) covered entirely in masonry, stone, wood, decorative metal or similar non-structural cladding material. For the purposes of this section, paint alone shall not qualify as a cladding material. 
Freestanding business signs on any individual development site shall not exceed one hundred (100) square feet in area, unless specifically allowed by this section. Freestanding signs are limited to one (1) per parcel, unless otherwise allowed by this section. Such signs shall have a minimum setback of ten (10) feet from any side lot line. Freestanding signs may be mounted on a base not exceeding four (4) feet in height. This base shall contain no lettering or advertising of any kind and may be solid or consist of a planter. The combined height of the base and sign shall not exceed sixteen (16) feet in height. Those electing to erect signs no more than twelve (12) feet in height, may increase their allowable sign area to one hundred twenty (120) square feet. 
Corner or double frontage lots shall be allowed two (2) freestanding signs. The combined area of these signs shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) square feet. 
The height measurement of signs on property lying below the finished grade of the street shall be taken from the adjacent curb elevation. 
For the purposes of this Section, a development site consisting of at least two (2) individual businesses and a minimum of 10,000 square feet of gross building area may be considered a shopping center.

(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 2. - Townhouses. 
    Townhouse developments shall be considered residential subdivisions and shall be subject to and comply with the provisions of the City of Enterprise subdivision regulations as applicable. Development plans for any proposed townhouse development must be approved by the Enterprise Planning Commission prior to submission of construction plans for issuance of a building permit. 
    It is the intent of this section that townhouses in areas where they are or may be permitted: 
a.  Should be located near major thoroughfares and collector streets where good access can be provided. 
b.  May be located primarily in areas near or adjacent to single-family residential areas. 
c.  May be used as a "buffer" use between single-family residences and other high density or incompatible land uses. 
d.  Shall constitute groupings making efficient, economical, comfortable and convenient use of land and open space and serving the public purposes of zoning by providing alternative means to conventional arrangements of yards and building areas. 
e.  Shall be high quality living units offering the maximum residential environmental amenities, including preservation of natural landform and foliage and the grouping of usable open space. 
    The following general requirements will apply to all townhouse dwelling units:

In any case, parking arrangements will be made so as to discourage on-street parking on public streets. No off-street parking space shall be more than 100 feet by the most direct pedestrian route from a door of the dwelling unit it is intended to serve. 
h.  All lots shall abut their full frontage on a publicly dedicated street on at least one end of the platted lot. An exception can be made to this requirement for condominium type development where commonly owned land lies between the dedicated street and where the intent of the requirement is upheld. 
i.  Attached townhouse dwellings shall be separated from each other by a fire and noise reduction partition wall which complies with building, fire and other applicable codes adopted by the City of Enterprise. 
j.  If a townhouse development contains any common area, common building, common off-street parking area, or common recreational facility, provisions satisfactory to the Enterprise City Council and approved by the city attorney shall be made to assure that common areas, common buildings, common off-street parking areas and common recreational facilities for the use and enjoyment of occupants of townhouses shall be maintained in a satisfactory manner without expense to the city or the general public. In addition, the developer of a townhouse development or homeowners association created by the developer, by recorded covenants and restrictions, shall preserve for the owners and occupants of the development such common area, common buildings, common off-street parking areas, and common recreational facilities established for the developer. 
    The following specific requirements apply to detached townhouses only. 
a.  Each detached townhouse shall have: one side yard of at least ten feet, the other side yard may be as little as zero feet, with each lot containing at least 2,400 square feet with a minimum of 24 feet at the building line. Additionally each lot shall have one yard containing at least 600 square feet, reasonably secluded from view of streets or neighboring property. 
b.  When a detached townhouse with a zero lot line is included in a townhouse complex, the lot adjacent to the zero setback side must be under the same ownership at the time of initial construction (ensuring that there will be no infringement on the property rights of owners of adjacent property). Additionally a five-foot easement for water drainage and wall maintenance must be established on the yard adjacent to the zero setback. This easement shall be shown on the plat and included in the restrictions and covenants for the development. Fences and walls may be located on or along this easement provided gates and other openings are provided so as not to block local lot drainage or wall access. 
c.  Each detached townhouse constructed on a zero lot line shall not: 
(1)  On the zero side, project over the lot line, except that roof overhang may penetrate the drainage and maintenance easement on the adjacent property a maximum of 30 inches, provided the roof shall be so designed so that water runoff shall be restricted to the drainage easement area. 
(2)  Have windows, doors or other openings on the zero side.

a.  A fifteen feet buffer yard shall be installed along the front property line and any property line abutting a public street. Each such buffer yard shall contain two (2) understory trees and three (3) shrubs per every one hundred (100) feet of propertyline abutting a public street; however this shall not be construed as requiring the planting of trees and shrubs on 100 foot centers. 
b.  All building sites abutting a residential zone or property used as residential on the rear or side yards shall be screened by a buffer planting strip not less than twenty (20) feet in width. Any required yard shall be counted as part of such buffer planting strip. Buffer planting strips shall comply with the following: 
1.  Landscaping: Screen planting shall be provided in sufficient density and of sufficient height (but in no case less than eight feet high) to afford protection to the residential area from the glare of lights, from blowing paper, dust and debris, and from visual encroachment, and to reduce the transmission of noise. Screen planting shall be maintained in a clean and neat condition. An eight (8) foot blind fence may be used at the discretion of the Planning Commission in exception to the dense vegetation. 
2.  Use of Land: No part of the buffer planting strip shall be used for any purpose other than screen planting. 
3.  Screen Walls: In the case of a lot of record on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, such lot being so unusually small that provisions of the 20-foot buffer planting strip precluded the reasonable use of the property for the uses permitted in the district in which the lot is located, upon approval of the planning commission, and subject to such conditions as it may prescribe as necessary to achieve the purpose of the screen planting, a screen wall of permanent material eight feet high may be substituted for the screen planting. In such case, the width of the buffer planting strip may be reduced to no less than 15 feet. 
c.  Dumpsters and all other refuse collection devices shall be located behind the front plane of the principal structure and shall be fully screened from the public view. 
    Tree Protection during Construction. Every attempt shall be made to protect and save existing trees on a development site, except for those trees removed to allow for the erection of the building and/or improvements. Whenever possible, a tree or group of trees that are being preserved must have a barrier constructed to the drip line of the tree or group of trees, given to specific considerations.

(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
ARTICLE X: - NONCONFORMITIES 

Section 1. - General Provisions. 
    It is the purpose of this Section to provide for the regulation of legally nonconforming lots, structures, and uses; and to specify the circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities can be continued, expanded, or modified; and under which they shall be terminated. 
    The zoning regulations established by this Ordinance are designed to promote and protect the public health, welfare, and safety by implementing the City's developmental policies. These policies encourage the grouping of compatible and related land uses. It is consistent with the regulations prescribed by this Ordinance that those nonconformities that adversely affect orderly development and the value of nearby property be controlled. Such controls also take into account the vested interests of the owners of nonconforming properties, and the extent to which such properties have any actual or potential adverse impacts upon the surrounding area. 
    To achieve these purposes, this Section distinguishes among nonconforming lots, nonconforming structures, nonconforming uses, and between major and minor nonconformities. Different regulations are applied to these categories on the basis of their actual or potential adverse impact due to incompatibility with the City's developmental policies and the regulations contained in this Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 2. - Definition of Nonconformities. 
    For the purposes of this Article the following definitions shall apply: 
    Nonconforming Lot of Record. Any vacant lot legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto, which does not fully comply with the dimensional regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
    Nonconforming Developed Lot. Any lot containing a building, structure, and/or activity legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto, but which does not fully comply with the lot width or area or other dimensional regulations of the zoning district in which it is located as specified in this Ordinance. 
    Nonconforming Structure. Any building or structure, other than a sign, legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto, but which does not fully comply with the yard, height or other dimensional regulations of the zoning district in which it is located as specified in this Ordinance. 
    Nonconforming Use. An activity using land, buildings, and/or structures for purposes, which were legal prior to the effective, date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto, but which does not fully comply with the use regulations for the zoning district in which it is located as specified in this Ordinance. 
    Nonconformity, Minor. Any property comprising a nonconforming developed lot and/or nonconforming structure, but which is used for an activity which is fully in compliance with the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located as specified in this Ordinance. 
    Nonconformity, Major. Any property comprising a nonconforming developed lot and/or a nonconforming structure, or a conforming developed lot and/or conforming structure which is used for an activity that is not fully in compliance with the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located as specified in this Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 3. - Nonconforming Lots of Record. 
    Nonconforming lots of record may be developed for any use permitted in the zoning district in which they are located provided such development conforms to all other regulations in this Ordinance or a variance from such regulations is granted by the Board of Adjustment to permit such development. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 4. - Minor Nonconformities. 
    Minor nonconformities may be modified, enlarged, and/or expanded provided that such modification, enlargement, or expansion conforms to all other regulations in this Ordinance, unless the Board of Adjustment grants a variance from such regulations. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 5. - Major Nonconformities. 
    A major nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided the new use is in the same or a lesser intensity of use classification as the original use. 
    A major nonconforming use shall not be enlarged within a structure, nor occupy a greater area of land, than it did at the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto. 
    A structure containing a major nonconforming use shall not be moved to any portion of the lot other than that occupied at the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment thereto. 
    A major nonconforming use shall not be altered, enlarged, or intensified in any way that increases its nonconformity, but may be altered or reduced to decrease its nonconformity. 
    A major nonconforming use which changes to a permitted use within the district in which it is located, shall not thereafter revert to a nonconforming use. 
    If a major nonconforming use is damaged in any manner to the extent that the restoration costs would exceed sixty (60) percent of the value of that use immediately before such damage occurred, or is discontinued and remains vacant for one year or more, any subsequent use of that lot and/or structure shall be in full compliance with the regulations governing the district in which it is located as specified in this Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 6. - General Provisions. 
    The following provisions shall apply to all nonconformities: 
    Except as otherwise provided in this Article, any nonconforming lot, structure or use lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance, or subsequent amendment thereto, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. 
    Nonconforming status runs with the land. 
    Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted to prohibit routine maintenance, restoration of a structure to a safe condition, internal renovations and modifications, and external improvements, which do not increase in scope or scale the nonconformity of the structure. 
    Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition; provided that such restoration of such structure is not otherwise in violation of the provisions of this Ordinance. 
    No nonconformity shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved. 
    Any other provision of this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, no use or structure which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have ceased or terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of this Ordinance. 
    The burden of establishing the nonconforming status of any structure or use under the terms of this Article in all cases shall be upon the owner of such nonconformity and not upon the City. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12)

    Variances. To hear and decide appeals for a variance from the provisions of this Ordinance where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of such provisions would result in unnecessary hardship as defined in Section 5 of this Article, but where the spirit of the Ordinance can be observed and substantial justice done. 
    Special Exceptions. To hear and decide special exceptions upon which the Board is required to act for uses as shown in Table 4-1 in Article IV and special exceptions regarding manufactured home as provided in Article VIII. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 4. - Administrative Appeals. 
    Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any person aggrieved or affected by any provision of the Ordinance or by any decision of the Building Official relating the provisions of this Ordinance. Any such appeal shall be filed with the Building Official within fifteen (15) days of the date of the action being appealed. The Building Official shall forthwith transmit to the Board papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken. 
    An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Building Official certifies to the Board after the notice of the appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts cited in such certification a stay would, in the Building Official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record. 
    All appeals shall be filed in writing on forms prescribed by the Board and made available by the Building Official. 
    The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for hearing the appeal.

Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, first class postage prepared, addressed to such property owners at their addresses submitted with the appeal. The notice shall state the name of the appellant, the location of the property, the decision of the Building Official, which is being appealed, and the time, date, and location of the Board hearing. 
    The Board may affirm, reverse wholly or in part, or modify the Building Official's decision, order, or determination as in its opinion ought to be done, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Building Official. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 5. - Variances. 
    Any property owner may file an application for a variance from the requirements of this Ordinance where it is claimed that, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions of such piece of property existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, the strict application and literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in peculiar, exceptional, undue, and unnecessary hardship upon such owner. 
    It is the intent of this Ordinance that variances be used only to overcome some physical condition of a parcel of land, which poses a practical difficulty to its development and prevents its owner form using the property in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance. Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the land. 
    An application for a variance shall be filed with the Building Official or Secretary of the Board at least thirty (30) days before the scheduled hearing date before the Board. The property owner or the authorized agent of the owner on a form made available by the Building Official shall file the application. At least five (5) days prior to the scheduled hearing of the Board, the Building Official shall give written notice of the application to all adjacent property owners. Such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, first class postage prepared, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as submitted with the application. Such notice shall state the name of the applicant, the location of the property, the nature of the variance requested and the applicable sections of this Ordinance, and the time, date, and location of the hearing. 
    The applicant must prove that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. In particular, the applicant shall establish and substantiate that the variance, if granted, will conform to all the requirements and standards listed below: 
a.  The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of a use that is not otherwise permitted in the district in which the property is located. 
b.  There must be proof of unique and special circumstances and conditions, fully described in the application, applicable to the land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the vicinity, and which circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of reasonable use of such land or buildings. 
c.  There must be proof of unnecessary hardship. It must result from the application of this Ordinance. It must be suffered directly by the property in question, and evidence of other variances granted under similar circumstances shall not be considered. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater value or profit would result if the variance were granted. Furthermore, the hardship claimed cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on this basis by one who purchases the property with or without knowledge of the restrictions. 
d.  The granting of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the adjacent neighborhood. 
e.  The granting of the variance will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance to other land, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district. 
f.  The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and the variance as requested is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose. 
g.  The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Ordinance on the district in which the property is located, and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
    The Board may prescribe any safeguards or conditions that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions of this Ordinance to which the variance applies. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 6. - Special Exceptions. 
    All uses permitted by special exception as listed in Article IV shall require the submission of an application to the Board of Adjustment. Such application shall be filed with the Building Official at least thirty (30) days before the scheduled hearing date before the Board of Adjustment. The application shall be filed by the property owner or the authorized agent of the owner on a form made available by the Building Official. 
    At least five (5) days prior to the scheduled hearing of the Board of Adjustment, the Building Official shall give written notice of the proposed special exception to all adjacent property owners. Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, first class postage prepared, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as submitted with the application. Such notice shall state the name of the applicant, the location of the property, the proposed use, and the time, date and location of the Board's hearing. 
    The Board of Adjustment shall review the application for compliance with this Ordinance and all other applicable codes and Ordinances of the City. In particular the Board shall determine that satisfactory provisions have been made concerning the following, among other considerations of this Ordinance: 
a.  Access to and from the property and the proposed structure and/or uses, with particular attention to vehicular and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and emergency access. 
b.  The location and accessibility of off-street parking and loading areas. 
c.  The location and accessibility of refuse and service areas and their potentially adverse affects upon surrounding properties. 
d.  The screening and buffering of potentially adverse views and activities from surrounding properties. 
e.  Control of noise, glare, odor, surface water runoff, and other potentially disturbing impacts upon surrounding properties. 
f.  The availability, location, and capacity of utilities. 
g.  The location and scale of signs and lighting with particular reference to traffic safety, glare, and visual compatibility with surrounding properties. 
h.  The bulk, density, and lot coverage of structures, and yards and open areas, with reference to their compatibility with the character of the surrounding area. 
    The Board may impose such conditions for approval that it deems necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance in relation to the items listed above and as may otherwise be reasonably necessary. Such conditions shall apply to the land, structure, and use for which the special exception is granted and not to a particular person. Violations of conditions lawfully attached to any special exception shall be deemed to be violations of this Ordinance. 
    The board of adjustment may also grant special exceptions to allow the location and usage of a manufactured home for human habitation in any zoning district of the city permitting residences. Applicants for such special exception shall apply in writing showing justification and shall provide a list of all adjacent property owners showing mailing addresses as well as a scale drawing of the proposed site with the desired manufactured home location shown. 
    Such special exception may be granted only if all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  Such manufactured homes must be for the use of the property owner or the property owner's family, to include in-laws, and are not to be rented or leased to any other person or persons. 
b.  The property owner must first demonstrate extenuating circumstances such as family hardship, practical difficulty, economic reasons deemed to be acceptable by the board of adjustment. 
c.  Special exceptions may be granted for any period of one to five years. At the termination of the granted period, the property owner must either remove the manufactured home from this location, or apply for another special exception. 
d.  Such special exceptions are not transferable. If there is a change of land ownership, the new property owner must apply for a new special exception if desired. 
e.  Before granting or denying any such request the board of adjustment, after conducting a public hearing, shall consider the justifications or circumstances involved as well as the objections or lack of objections of adjacent property owners, and the possible negative effects on neighborhood property values or qualities of life. 
    The Board of Adjustment may also grant special exceptions for business use of a manufactured home in a business zone upon showing of catastrophic circumstances created by Act of God or casualty damage. Such special exceptions will be valid for a period not exceeding one year and are not transferable. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 7. - Abatement of Nuisance. 
    The board of adjustment may require the conduct of any use, conforming or nonconforming, which results in unreasonable noise, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, fire, radio interference, or explosion hazard or nuisance to surrounding property to be modified or changed to abate such hazard to health, comfort, and convenience. The board of adjustment may direct the Building Official to issue an abatement order, but such order may be directed only after a public hearing by the board, notice of which shall be sent by registered mail to the owners and/or operator of the property on which the use is conducted in addition to due notice or advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation. A hearing to consider issuance of an abatement order shall be held by the board of adjustment either upon petition signed by any person affected by the hazard or nuisance or upon the initiative of the board. An abatement order shall be directed by the board of adjustment only upon reasonable evidence of hazard or nuisance and such order shall specify the date by which the hazard or nuisance shall be abated. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 8. - Re-hearings. 
    All decisions rendered by the Board shall be final and binding upon all parties.

(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 6. - Conditional Use Procedures. 
    Conditional uses are those that have some special effect, which differs from the potential impacts of permitted uses or exceeds them in intensity, or have uniqueness such that their effect upon the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of a use being proposed in a particular location. As such, conditional uses must be reviewed in terms of existing zoning and land use in the vicinity of the proposed use: whether, and to what extent the use at the proposed location is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the intent of this Zoning Ordinance, and another development policies and/or regulations of the City of Enterprise; and whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by the developer to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use on the immediate vicinity and on the public health, welfare and safety in general. 
    All conditional uses where listed in Table 4-1 of Article IV shall require the submission of an application to the Board of Adjustment. Such application shall be filed with the Building Official by the property owner or the authorized agent of the property owner at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the application is scheduled to be heard by the Board of Adjustment, and shall include a site plan in accordance Section 4. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled hearing before the Board of Adjustment, the Building Official shall give written notice to all adjoining property owners. Such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, first class postage prepared, addressed to such property owners at their addresses submitted with the appeal. Such addresses shall be obtained by the applicant from the most recent records of the County Tax Assessor and submitted as part of the application. 
    The Board of Adjustment shall review the proposed conditional use for compliance with this Ordinance and other applicable codes and Ordinances, and for compatibility with the purposes of the zoning district within which it is proposed to be located. In particular the Board of Adjustment shall determine that satisfactory provisions have been made concerning the following: 
a.  Access to and from the property and the proposed structure and/or uses, with particular attention to vehicular and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and emergency access. 
b.  The location and accessibility of off-street parking and loading areas. 
c.  The location and accessibility of refuse and service areas and their potentially adverse affects upon surrounding properties. 
d.  The screening and buffering of potentially adverse views and activities from surrounding properties. 
e.  Control of noise, glare, odor, surface water runoff, and other potentially disturbing impacts upon surrounding properties. 
f.  The availability, location, and capacity of utilities. 
g.  The location and scale of signs and lighting with particular reference to traffic safety, glare, and visual compatibility with surrounding properties. 
h.  The bulk, density, and lot coverage of structures, and yards and open areas, with reference to their compatibility with the character of the surrounding area. 
    The Board of Adjustment may impose such conditions for approval as it deems necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and further the purposes of this Ordinance, in relation both to the items listed above and to any other factor it deems relevant. Such approval and conditions shall be granted to the property, structure, and/or use for which conditional use is approved and not to a particular person. Violations of conditions attached to any conditional use shall be deemed to be violations of this Ordinance. 
    The decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be final subject to those appeal rights referenced in Article XI, Section 9 of the Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 7. - Statutory Review. 
    The Planning Commission shall review the character, location and extent of any public street, square, park or other public way, ground, open space or building or structure, or any major utility project, whether publicly or privately owned, in accordance with Section 11-52-11 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, as amended. The purpose of such review shall be to determine whether or not such projects are consistent with the goals and policies of the City's Comprehensive Plan. The Planning Commission's findings and recommendations shall be transmitted to the City Council. Failure of the Planning Commission to act on an official submission within sixty (60) days from the date of such submission shall be deemed to be approval of the project. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 8. - Certificate of Occupancy Required. 
    The owner or owner's agent prior to use or occupancy of any building or structure, whose construction or substantial rehabilitation is undertaken following adoption of this Ordinance, shall secure a Certificate of Occupancy. Within three (3) days after the owner or owner's agent has notified the Building Official that a building or premises or part thereof is ready for occupancy or use, the Building Official shall make a final inspection thereof, and issue a Certificate of Occupancy if the building or premises or part thereof is found to conform with the provisions of this Ordinance, or, if such certificate is refused, state such refusal in writing with the cause. The Board of Adjustment shall hear appeals from the decision of the Building Official. One copy of the signed statement by the owner or his or her agent regarding the intended use of the premises, and a signed refusal (if any) shall be kept on file with the records of the Building Official. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 9. - Expiration of Building Permit. 
    Any permit under which no construction work has been done above the foundation wall or other foundation support within six (6) months from the date of issuance shall expire by limitation, but shall upon reapplication, be renewable, subject, however, to the provisions of any Ordinances in force at the time of said application for renewal. In no event shall any permit be renewed more than one time. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 10. - Unlawful Structure. 
    Any uses of land or dwellings or construction or alteration of buildings or structures erected, altered, razed or converted in violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance are hereby declared to be a nuisance per se. The Building Official is hereby authorized to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to abate the nuisance created by such unlawful use of a structure, land or building. Whenever the Building Official has declared a structure to be in violation of any applicable provisions of this Ordinance, the owner or occupant shall, within seventy-two (72) hours from receipt of notification from the Building Official to vacate such premises, accomplish such vacation of said structure or premises until such structure or premises has been adapted to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. Such notification shall be: 
a.  By delivery to the owner personally, or by leaving the notice at the usual place of abode of the owner with a person of suitable age and discretion; or 
b.  By depositing the notice in the United States as first class certified mail; or 
c.  By posting and keeping posted for seventy-two (72) hours, a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises to be repaired. 
(Ord. No. 06-05-12, 7-17-12) 
Section 11. - Penalties and Remedies. 
    Any person, firm, corporation, or other organization which violates any provisions of this Ordinance shall be fined, upon conviction, not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus court costs for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. The conviction of a violation and imposition of any fine shall not constitute an exemption from compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance. In case any building or other structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained; or any building, structure or land is used in violation of this Ordinance, the Building Official of the City may seek an injunction or writ of mandamus or take other appropriate action or proceedings to stay or prevent occupancy of such building, structure or land.
