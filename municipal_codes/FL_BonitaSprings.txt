PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Bonita Springs, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE INDEX LDCi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Dianne Lynn, City Clerk/Director of Administrative Services, Audrey Vance; City Attorney; and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a City Code which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

    Section 4. General penalty; continuing violations. 
A.  The phrase "violation of this Land Development Code" means any of the following: 
1.  Doing an act that is prohibited or made or declared unlawful, an offense or a misdemeanor by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance.

With respect to violations of this Land Development Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues constitutes a separate offense in the absence of provisions to the contrary. 
D.  Any violation of this Land Development Code that arose from provisions that are subsequently repealed and reenacted will continue to be a violation of this Code and any penalties imposed for those violations will continue to exist unless the subsequent amendment or repeal of the violated provisions clearly intends to make previous violations legal and expressly voids any penalties imposed for those violations.

Amendments to the original enactment have been worked into their proper places, and history notes indicating the origin of the amendatory section and the date of the referendum, where applicable, have been added.

Footnotes: 
--- (6) ---

Sec. 2-124. - Creation of position of hearing examiner. 
(a)  For the purpose of enforcing the city's codes and ordinances the city creates an alternate code enforcement system, pursuant to F.S. ch. 162, that gives hearing examiners the authority to hold hearings and impose fines, liens and other noncriminal penalties against violators of the city's codes and ordinances. 
(b)  Upon prior recommendation of the city manager, the city council by a majority vote may appoint hearing examiners, for a term of one-year. A hearing examiner shall be an individual who shall have been determined by the city council to have the knowledge, skill and abilities to perform as hearing examiner. 
(c)  Hearing examiners shall receive an hourly rate of compensation to be determined by the city council, with the recommendation of the city manager, based upon the prevailing rates for hearing examiners in the area with similar background and experience. 
(d)  Hearing examiners shall have the duties, powers and responsibilities and shall carry out the functions and procedures as set forth in this chapter. 
(e)  The city manager shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required for the proper performance of the hearing examiner's duties. 
(Ord. No. 03-10, § 1(2-421), 6-18-2003; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-471), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-125. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  Initiation of proceedings. It will be the duty of the code enforcement officer to initiate code enforcement proceedings. No hearing examiner shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Initial violation. Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a code enforcement officer finds a city code or ordinance violation, notice shall be given to the violator indicating the type of violation found and the manner in which it may be corrected. The notice must also provide a reasonable time in which to correct the violation. If the violation continues beyond the time provided, the code enforcement officer shall request a hearing before the hearing examiner. The clerical staff of the hearing examiner will schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing to the violator pursuant to section 2-130. A case may be presented to the hearing examiner even if the violation has been corrected, prior to the hearing, provided the violation was not corrected within the specified time period or the violation was corrected and reoccurred, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  Repeat violation. If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator of the type of violation and the manner in which it can be abated, but the violator is not entitled to a reasonable time to correct the violation. Once the violator has been notified of the repeat violation, the code enforcement officer shall request a hearing before the hearing examiner. The clerical staff of the hearing examiner shall schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing to the violator, pursuant to section 2-130. The case may be presented to the hearing examiner even if the repeat violation is corrected prior to the hearing and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the hearing examiner retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine the costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his rights to this hearing and pay the costs as determined by the hearing examiner. 
(d)  Immediate hearing. If the code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator, and may request an immediate hearing before the hearing examiner. 
(e)  Transfer of property. If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before a hearing examiner or a court, transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing examiner hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and the materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a written notice with the code enforcement official disclosing the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(f)  Notification of parties. In addition to notifying the violator as provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the code enforcement officer, clerical staff or other persons designated by the city manager may also provide notice by mail or other means to the mortgage holders and/or other persons or entities having an interest in the subject property.

Upon request of the code enforcement officer or at such other times as may be necessary, the hearing examiner may call hearings to take place on a day or at a time not regularly set aside for code enforcement hearings. The clerical staff of the hearing examiner is responsible for scheduling cases to be heard by the hearing examiner. All code enforcement proceedings and hearings shall be open to the public, and minutes shall be kept of all hearings. 
(b)  Prosecution of the case. Each case on the code enforcement docket will be presented to the hearing examiner by a city attorney or code enforcement officer familiar with the case. If the city is successful in prosecuting a case before the hearing examiner, it will be entitled to recover a civil penalty of up to $250.00 for initial proceeding and up to $500.00 for proceedings that are repeat violation. 
(c)  Hearing testimony. The hearing examiner will proceed to hear the cases and shall take testimony from members of the code enforcement staff and alleged violators. All testimony will be under oath and recorded. Formal rules of evidence will not apply, but fundamental due process is to be observed and will govern the proceedings. 
(d)  Hearing examiner order. At the conclusion of the hearing, and based upon the evidence presented, the hearing examiner shall issue findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order affording appropriate relief consistent with the powers granted herein. An order finding a violation may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that failure to comply by that date may result in a fine being imposed in the amount stated in the order and, if the violation is abated by the city, the cost of repairs may be included with the fine. 
(e)  Recording the order. A certified copy of the order finding violation may be recorded in the public records of Lee County and will be binding on the violator. If the recorded order concerns real property it will constitute notice to, and be binding upon, any subsequent purchasers, successor in interest, or assigns. If an order finding violation is recorded in the public records and subsequently complied with by the date specified in the order, the hearing examiner must issue an order acknowledging compliance that is also recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue an order acknowledging compliance.

Upon notification by the code enforcement officer that the violator has failed to comply with the hearing examiner's order within the time specified or, upon finding a repeat violation has occurred, the hearing examiner may order the violator to pay a fine. The fine may be imposed for each day the violation continues past the date specified for compliance. In the case of a repeat violation, a fine may be imposed for each day the repeat violation continues beginning with the date the code enforcement officer first documents a violation exists. The hearing examiner may impose additional fines to include any enforcement costs incurred by the city. The city may make all reasonable repairs required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed under this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. A hearing will not be necessary for the issuance of an order imposing the fine if a finding of a violation or repeat violation has been made as provided herein. If after due notice and hearing a hearing examiner finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Penalties. 
(1)  A fine imposed under this section cannot exceed $250.00 per day for the first violation or $500.00 per day for a repeat violation. However, if the hearing examiner finds a violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, a fine of up to $5,000.00 per violation can be imposed. Further, the fine may include the cost of all repairs incurred in accordance with subsection (a) of this section as well as the cost of prosecuting the case before the hearing examiner. 
(2)  The following factors will be considered by the hearing examiner in determining the fine to be imposed: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
The hearing examiner may mitigate the fine imposed under this section. 
(3)  If the violation is of the type described in section 2-130, all such sums shall become immediately due and payable upon expenditure by the city and shall become delinquent if not paid within 30 days after notice to the violator of either the city's bill or hearing examiner's order itemizing the costs incurred. All such delinquent sums shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum. 
(c)  Creation of a lien. A certified copy of an order imposing fines or imposing fines plus costs of repair or imposing fines plus cost of repair plus any delinquency charges may be recorded in the public records and thereafter will constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order will not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed under this article will continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is tendered in a suit to foreclose the lien, whichever occurs first. Proof of compliance must be submitted to the code enforcement officer. 
(d)  Release or satisfaction of lien. A lien arising from a fine imposed under this section runs in favor of the city council and the city council may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered in accordance with this section. A release or satisfaction of lien may be executed by the mayor on behalf of the entire city council. The mayor on behalf of the city council upon full payment may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section; in the event of settlement for less than the full amount of said lien, satisfaction or release shall require a mitigation hearing before the hearing examiner. Mitigation will be processed as follows: 
(1)  The person requesting mitigation must be a property owner, authorized agent, or be in the position to be acquiring the property. If the person does not have title, the director can negotiate a proposed plan for mitigation and hold the hearing before the hearing examiner, but any release of the lien will not take place until such time the person has taken title. 
(2)  The director will consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in determining their recommendation for reduction of the lien arising from the fine imposed. 
(3)  In no circumstance will the fine be greater than the assessed value of the property, as based on the most recent appraisal by the Lee County Property Appraiser. 
(4)  The city council may, from time to time upon adoption of a resolution, create an amnesty program allowing abatement at a reduced rate as set forth in a formula during a specific time period. 
(5)  The director may upon his own initiative send letters to outstanding property owners to create an internal mitigation program for the purpose of reducing liens running over five years for the purpose of seeking abatement. 
(4)  Mitigation may not be used for purposes of rehearing or appeal of the original order imposing the fine. 
(e)  Lien foreclosure. The hearing examiner may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on a lien which remains unpaid for a period of three or more months after filing. In no circumstance will the lien be greater than the assessed value of the property, as based on the most recent appraisal by the Lee County Property Appraiser. No lien created under this article may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the state constitution. 
(f)  Duration of lien. A lien established in accordance with the provisions of this article may not continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on the lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city is entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of an action will not be enforceable against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a lis pendens is recorded.

If the landowner fails to remove the TSU unit within the 24-hour period, the city, at its option, may enter into the residential property and remove the TSU unit. Landowners shall be liable for all costs incurred by the city for the removal of the TSU unit under these circumstances.

Sec. 12-29. - Responsibilities of certified craftsman. 
(a)  Disallow use of name to obtain permit for unlawful work. It is unlawful for any contractor or master craftsman to allow his name to be used to obtain permits for work: 
(1)  Which is to be done by anyone who is not a bona fide employee of the contractor or master craftsman or of the entity for which the contractor or master craftsman works full time; or 
(2)  Which is not done under the supervision of the contractor or master craftsman. 
(b)  Lawful work by lawful craftsman. It is the responsibility of the contractor or master craftsman obtaining a permit under his name to ensure that: 
(1)  Work done under the permit complies with the law and regulations related to the work. 
(2)  The work is done by craftsmen holding valid certificates where required; for this purpose, a certified craftsman is deemed to do the work if he is in direct charge of the work, is continuously present on the site where the work is being done, and is assisted by no more than four helpers. 
(c)  Performance of work under improper or no permit declared unlawful. It is unlawful for any contractor, master or journeyman craftsman to do work for which no permit has been issued where required or the permit does not cover the full extent of the work. 
(d)  Registration of employer. Each contractor and master craftsman serving as a qualifying agent shall register with the building official the name and place of business of his full-time employer. No contractor or master craftsman serving as a qualifying agent shall serve in that capacity more than one employer at a time. No master craftsman shall serve as qualifying agent for more than two contractors in any 12-month period. 
(e)  Notification of change in employment. Each contractor or master craftsman serving as a qualifying agent shall promptly notify the building official of a change in employment. If a contractor has obtained a permit for work to be done under the supervision of a master craftsman who later leaves the contractor's employ, work authorized by the permit may be done by qualified journeyman craftsmen, notwithstanding the lack of supervision by a master craftsman, but only as provided in section 12-31(b). 
(f)  Qualifying agent generally. Where a master craftsman has notified the building official, by endorsement of an application for a contractor's certificate or otherwise, that he is serving a contractor as qualifying agent, the master craftsman shall be held responsible under this Code for ensuring that all work done by the contractor is in compliance with all provisions of this Code applicable thereto. A qualifying agent is required to keep himself informed of the status of work being performed by his employing contractor and to carry out the responsibilities delineated by this section. It is the express intent of these regulations that a master craftsman serving as a qualifying agent will be physically capable of carrying out his responsibilities at all times while employed in that capacity.

Failure to return a revoked permit or to deliver a permit for correction to the building official upon demand is an offense against the city. 
(b)  Error resulting in denial. The building official may correct an error of law or of fact, or an administrative error, which resulted in the denial of an application for a building permit.

Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, whenever the holder of a contractor registration fails to maintain one or more of the qualifications required for the issuance of a registration, he shall within five days report his lack of qualifications to the building official. The registration is automatically suspended from the date on which the holder first failed to maintain all of the required qualifications until he reestablishes his qualifications. In lieu of suspension and on request of the holder, the building official may declare the certificate inactive for a stated period of time. Suspended registrations under this section become invalid after one year and shall not thereafter be renewed. 
(b)  Failure to have a qualifying agent. If a contractor fails to have a required qualifying agent for a period of 30 consecutive days, his contractor registration is automatically suspended. During the 30-day period, the contractor may complete any work for which all permits have been issued prior to the loss of the agent, but he may not obtain any new permits or contract for new work. Upon suspension, the contractor shall cease all work. Until a suspended registration becomes invalid under subsection (a) of this section, but not thereafter, suspension automatically terminates when the contractor again acquires a qualifying agent.

(c)  The city may institute in any court of competent jurisdiction action to prevent, restrain, correct or abate any violation of this article or any order or ruling made in connection with its administration or enforcement by way of mandatory injunction or otherwise, as deemed proper by the court. In certain cases restitution may be sought in lieu of fine and/or imprisonment. The code enforcement officers may, in addition, or alternatively, to pursuing criminal penalties or seeking injunctive relief, bring violations before the code enforcement hearing examiner, in accordance with all of the provisions of, and pursuant to, the enforcement procedures established under chapter 2. Each separate occurrence of a violation of this article shall constitute a separate violation, and shall be punishable as such. 
(d)  If a violation is brought to the hearing examiner in accordance with F.S. § 489.127 the fine schedule, which is on file in the city clerk's office, will be used by the code enforcement officer when the person does not contest the violation. If contested, the hearing examiner may deviate from the fine schedule (increase or decrease, depending on the circumstances) and impose any additional fines to cover all costs incurred by the city in enforcing its codes and any cost of repairs to city property. 
(e)  Judicial review. Judicial review shall be as provided by law.

(4)  The applicant provided the correct street address for all parcels or property covered by this article. 
(b)  If the city manager or designee has reasonable cause to believe that a dwelling unit is being leased, subleased, rented or occupied without a permit in violation of this article, the owner of the property shall be given notice that a permit is required and that an application must be filed with the city within 30 days of the notice.

The owner shall notify the city in writing of the name, address, and telephone number of the agent. Failure to provide the city with a local agent shall subject the owner to citation for violation of this article and proceedings before the hearing examiner. If no local agent is provided in the application and the owner resides outside the Twentieth Judicial District, it is presumed that the owner has agreed to constructive notice of a violation of this article by publication as posted at city hall. 
(b)  No permit shall be issued or renewed until the applicant or permit holder has provided the name and phone number of a natural person 18 years of age or older who can be contacted 24 hours a day, seven days a week, regarding the rental unit.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 16-14 , § 1, adopted Aug. 17, 2016, amended § 12-110 in its entirety. Former § 12-110 pertained to inspections, reinspections and complaints and derived from Ord. No. 05-14, § 5, adopted July 20, 2005; and Ord. No. 07-22, § 5, adopted Dec. 5, 2007. 
Sec. 12-111. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  After the first occurrence of a violation of this article, the city manager or designee shall send a written warning to the permittee or agent. The warning will specify the ordinance or code provision upon which the public nuisance or violation is based and will state that any further public nuisances or violations of the above-enumerated ordinances or codes may result in revocation of the permit for that unit. 
(b)  A second occurrence of a public nuisance or one of the above violations within one year of sending of the written warning provided in subsection (a) of this section shall constitute a violation of this section, and may subject the owner to revocation of the permit for that unit. 
(c)  Failure to respond to code enforcement citations or failure to attend code enforcement proceedings may subject the owner to the revocation of the permit for that unit. 
(d)  The hearing examiner is qualified to act as hearing officer to conduct hearings pursuant to this section. 
(e)  Prior to the issuance of an order by the hearing examiner, the city shall give written notice of violation, and opportunity for a hearing, to the permittee or agent of the unit and to any tenant of the particular unit. 
(f)  Service of the written notice of violation shall be deemed complete if personally delivered upon the permittee or agent, and if the same cannot be delivered personally within the city, then service shall be deemed complete upon sending same by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the owner or agent. 
(g)  Any officer authorized by law to serve process or a duly appointed law enforcement officer of the county (or applicable sheriff's office within the Twentieth Judicial Circuit) sheriff's office may make service of process. The person serving process shall promptly make proof of service by affidavit or, in any event, within the time period during which the person served must respond to the process. Failure to make proof of service shall not affect the validity of the service. 
(h)  The hearing examiner shall conduct a hearing within 30 days after service is deemed complete. 
(i)  Lack of knowledge of, acquiescence to, participation in, or responsibility for, a public nuisance or other violation on the part of the permittee or agent shall not be a defense by such permittee or agent. However, proof that the permittee or agent has commenced the process of terminating the lease and recovering possession of the rental unit under state law and is diligently pursuing completion or has completed the process shall be a defense to public nuisance as described by state or local law. However, the vacation of the premises or rental unit shall not be deemed to constitute abatement of a violation when the unit can be rented again, therefore, a finding of violation may be imposed upon a permittee and/or agent for purposes of being treated as a repeat violator. 
(j)  If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the hearing examiner finds no public nuisance or violation to exist, the hearing examiner will dismiss the revocation action with leave to the city to refile should the city have additional or new evidence giving reasonable cause to believe that a violation exists. 
(k)  If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the hearing examiner finds the existence of a public nuisance or other violation, the hearing examiner shall issue a final order. 
(l)  The hearing examiner shall have all the powers to this end, including power to subpoena and the authority to revoke a permit for the rental unit for a period not to exceed six months, including costs awarded to the city in an amount not to exceed $500.00 for costs of prosecution. 
(m)  Orders of the hearing examiner issued pursuant to this section shall be posted at the rental unit, and shall be mailed to the permittee, agent and the rental unit within seven business days of the hearing examiner's decision. 
(n)  If the permit is revoked under these procedures, the permittee shall have ten days from the day the order is mailed to commence proceedings to terminate the lease and recover possession of the rental unit under state law. The permittee shall diligently pursue the process to completion. The permittee shall provide copies of all documents provided to the tenants or filed with the court concerning the process. 
(o)  In addition to other procedures, the city may file for injunction to abate the public nuisance or other violation, or utilize other remedies as permitted by law.

Sec. 12-112. - Denial or revocation of permit. 
(a)  The city manager or designee may deny issuance of, or revoke, any permits applied for under this section if it is determined either that the applicant or holder has made material misrepresentations about the condition of his property, or that the occupancy of the property is, or at any time subsequent to the issuance of the permit becomes, in excess of occupancy by a single-family as defined in the land development code, or that the owner has otherwise violated a provision of this article. 
(b)  If the city manager or designee determines there is reasonable cause to believe that there are grounds to revoke or deny a permit applied for or held a written notice shall be sent by registered mail to the owner or agent whose address was provided in the application for such permit. If the dwelling unit in question is occupied, a copy of the notice shall be mailed to at least one tenant. Such written notice shall state the alleged grounds for revocation or denial. For revocation of a permit, such written notice shall also state that the revocation will become effective 30 days from the date of the notice unless, within the 30 days, the alleged grounds for revocation are remedied (or legal action to do so is begun) to the satisfaction of the city manager or designee. 
(c)  Within 30 days of the date the notice of revocation or denial is mailed, a holder of or applicant for a permit or the appointed agent may request in writing to the city manager a hearing before the hearing examiner on the revocation or denial. The city manager or designee shall schedule the hearing to occur within 30 days after receiving the request for hearing and shall notify the permit holder or applicant at least five days in advance. The hearing may be postponed if mutually agreed to by all parties. 
(d)  The hearing shall be conducted informally and adherence to the rules of evidence normally followed by the courts shall not be required. Any person may present testimony, documents or other evidence as deemed relevant by the hearing examiner. Any person may be represented by counsel. 
(e)  The hearing examiner shall consider all evidence presented, and if the preponderance of the evidence supports the allegation of violation the permit shall be denied or revoked. If the preponderance of the evidence does not support the allegation of violation, the permit shall be issued or allowed to continue. The decision of the hearing examiner may be appealed to the county court. 
(f)  The city manager or designee may waive the revocation requirement as to any permit if it is determined that the owner has attempted in good faith to comply with this article. In determining asserted good faith as required for a waiver, the city manager or designee may consider, but not be limited to, the owner's having remedied the violation, and the owner's past history of violations of the conditions of the landlord permit.

d.  Mileage is measured as the shortest distance (as the crow flies), between the location or scene of the tow's origination and the storage facility. 
(3)  Storage charges must be based upon a 24-hour calendar day, beginning at 12:01 a.m. and ending at 12:00 midnight. A vehicle/vessel in storage for six hours or longer, in any 24-hour calendar day, will accrue storage charges for that 24-hour calendar day.

Example: Vehicle arrives in storage a 6:30 p.m., Monday, and is picked up 6:30 a.m., Tuesday. No charges accrue for storage on Monday because storage on Monday was only 5.5 hours; storage charges do accrue for Tuesday, as storage on Tuesday was for 6.5 hours. These storage rates are applicable when: 
a.  Law enforcement has authorized the vehicle to be impounded; or 
b.  The appropriate law enforcement agency has been notified by the tow operator, within 30 minutes after the completion of the tow/removal, that the towing company is in possession of a vehicle resulting from a private property impound tow in accord with F.S. § 715.07.

(5)  Administrative fees, including any lien fees, may be charged only after the vehicle has been in storage for at least three full calendars days; and: 
a.  The law enforcement agency has prepared an incident report authorizing the vehicle impoundment; 
b.  The appropriate law enforcement agency has been notified by the tow operator, within 30 minutes after completion of the tow/removal, that the towing company is in possession of a vehicle resulting from a private property impound tow in accord with F.S. § 715.07; and 
c.  The towing company provides proof that the lien notices have been prepared and sent in accordance with F.S. § 713.78, including the appropriate names and addresses of the owner and lienholder, and the certified mail information and has otherwise complied with the provisions of F.S. §§ 713.58 and 713.78. 
(6)  Underwater recovery fees may be charged if the recovery activity is performed by a certified or professional diver, upon the written authorization and approval of the investigating law enforcement agency or officer on the scene. 
(7)  A late hour gate period may be established by the tow operator between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. daily. Late hour gate fees may be charged when: 
a.  An impounded vehicle is recovered by the owner or authorized representative during the late hour gate period. 
b.  The owner or authorized representative seeks to recover property from an impounded vehicle during the late hour gate period. However, no charges are permitted for removal/recovery of prescription medication or prescription eyeglasses from an impounded vehicle by the owner or authorized representative. If the towing company/storage entity determines that the owner or authorized representative made a false request to recover prescription medications or eyeglasses in order to recover other items, the towing operator may impose a late hour gate fee that is double the rate adopted by the county under this article. The towing company/storage entity may request that a law enforcement officer be present at a time agreed for the recovery of prescription items under this section.

For purposes of this article, a floor planner who meets the criteria below is exempt from this definition of a title loan lender.

Upon sale of any vehicle where the loan is given by the floor planner, the registered car dealer must pay the loan given by the floor planner in full with any interest owed, in accordance with the general laws of this state. A floor planner may not charge an interest rate in excess of four percent for the first 30-day period, and three percent for the next two 30-day periods following that the title loan agreement remains outstanding and unsatisfied. The maximum period of time for a loan qualifying under this exemption on any one vehicle shall be 90 days.

Sec. 18-38. - Enhanced telephone verification of burglar alarm signals. 
(a)  Extended time. The time permitted for enhanced verification of non-certified systems may be extended beyond the time constraints imposed for certified systems defined in UL Standard 827 as appropriate under the facts known by monitoring center personnel. 
(b)  Procedure. For alarm signals received from non-certified commercial burglar alarm systems or any residential alarm system signal such as a burglar, duress or panic, the following procedures shall be followed: 
(1)  Call one. The monitoring facility shall attempt telephone verification to the protected premises after receipt of the alarm signal. 
(2)  Call two. If a monitoring facility operator gets a busy signal or no answer on the first call to the protected premises, a second call or calls shall be made to an alternate phone number such as a cellular, work or second number at the protected premises. 
(3)  Answering machines. If the first or second call reaches an answering machine, a message should be left clearly stating that it is the alarm company calling and leaving necessary information for the alarm user to promptly contact the monitoring facility. 
(4)  Person on premises without proper code. If the operator reaches the protected premises on the first or second call and the person answering the phone does not have the proper pass code, then the operator shall attempt to make a three-way call with the premises person retained as a party to the call. The three-way call shall attempt to reach others on the call list to verify the authenticity of the person on the protected premises. If this process fails to resolve the issue, then the operator should proceed to notify the dispatch authority. 
(5)  Scheduled events. If an alarm signal is received in connection with a scheduled opening or closing event, additional numbers shall be called on the call list in order to determine whether an opening or closing error caused the alarm signal. 
(6)  Verified false. If the alarm is verified as being false during the first, second or succeeding call as a result of getting a valid pass code, the operator shall suspend activities relating to the specific signal being worked. 
(7)  Notification call. Call to the law enforcement authority such as 911. 
(8)  Call lists and priority. Following notification of law enforcement authorities, attention shall be placed on completing the entire emergency call list with priority to achieve a cancellation of the dispatch if it is verified that no emergency exists. Subsequent to dispatch of a sworn officer, the priority of notification calls to phone numbers in the customer's database shall be first to numbers where there is a high probability of reaching an alarm user. The succeeding calls shall be made next to neighbors, then to non-premises people such as relatives or secondary key holders. 
(9)  Verification phone accessibility guideline. Care shall be taken to verify that the emergency call list phone numbers are to phones without call waiting, or alternately that *70 is programmed in front of the monitoring center phone number in the electronic digital communicator. The verification phones at the monitored premises shall be accessible after normal business hours (not locked up in an office), such as in the vicinity of commonly used entrances. The verification phones shall not direct callers to voice mail so that employees and cleaning people who are working after normal business hours may hear and answer the phone. 
(c)  Additional methods. Audio verification, video verification, or cross zoning shall be permitted in place of, or in addition to, the second verification call and shall be considered in compliance with this enhanced verification standard.

Upon your failure to abate this nuisance, the City Manager shall order abatement thereof and at that time City employees, servants, agents or contractors will enter upon your property and abate the nuisance. The cost of such abatement will be levied as an assessment against your property. Thereafter, the City Manager shall prepare an assessment bill for the entire cost of abatement. 
If you wish to contest this Notice of Violation, you may appeal to the City Manager. Requests for appeal must be made in writing and should be directed to the Code Enforcement Office within five (5) days of receipt of this Notice. All decisions of the City Manager shall be final. 
A second notice will contain an invoice detailing the costs incurred by the City to abate the nuisance on your property along with a request for payment of these costs within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice. In the event this invoice is not paid in full within thirty (30) days, an assessment lien will be placed against your property. 
The assessment is created by a lien signed by the Code Enforcement Hearing Examiner and includes the cost to abate the nuisance and associated administrative costs. Under the lien, the City will be entitled to collect interest on the unpaid balance of the assessment at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year for the life of the lien. Upon execution of the lien, the City Manager will cause a certified copy of the lien to be recorded in the official public records of Lee County, Florida. You should understand that once this lien is recorded it constitutes a special assessment lien against your property that will remain until it is paid. This means that any subsequent transfer, sale or other disposition of the property will be affected or otherwise be encumbered by this lien. Further, you should also be aware that the City has the power to enforce any assessment, together with this accumulated interest thereon, by civil action, including but not limited to, foreclosure of the lien. 
All questions and requests for appeals shall be directed to the City Manager c/o Code Enforcement, 9101 Bonita Beach Road, Bonita Springs, FL 34135. 
(c)  Within five days of receipt of the first notice of violation by mail on posting, the owners of the property may make a written request to the city manager for a hearing to demonstrate that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such a condition does not constitute a nuisance. All decisions of the city manager shall be final. 
(d)  At the expiration of the ten-day period, the city manager shall reinspect the described premises to ascertain whether the nuisance has been abated. Should the city manager determine that the condition of the subject lot or acreage remains a nuisance as defined in this article, the city manager is authorized to enter upon the property and take such steps as are reasonably necessary to effect abatement. The city manager is also authorized to abate the nuisance if reasonable attempts to notify the owners have failed with the ability to place a lien on the property upon a finding by the code enforcement hearing examiner that exigent circumstances existed or that service was purposely obstructed by the property owner or agent. 
(e)  After abatement by the city manager, the city manager shall prepare an assessment invoice which includes the name of the owners, a description of the affected parcel, and a brief description of services rendered, including administrative and operating expenses incurred in abating the nuisance. The city manager shall send this information by regular mail to the owners. The notice shall demand payment of the assessment within 30 days of mailing; and shall provide that, if the assessment invoice is not paid as directed, the city will place a lien against the property. Interest on said lien shall accrue at a rate of 12 percent per annum on the unpaid balance of the assessment. The notice shall state that at the time and place mentioned (not less than 30 days from the date of mailing of said notice), the city shall levy a special assessment lien signed by the hearing examiner in the full amount of such costs listed against the assessed properties. Such lien shall describe the property and show the cost of abatement. After the assessment lien has been executed, a certified copy of the lien shall be recorded in the official records of the county. The special assessment lien shall become effective and due and payable to the city on the date the lien is recorded by the clerk of the circuit court, and such recordation shall serve as constructive notice of the existence of said lien. Until payment is complete, such assessment shall be a legal, valid and binding obligation on the property. The form of the second notice of violation shall be as follows:

As the Owner of Record of the above-described property, you were notified on (date) that a nuisance existed on your property contrary to the City of Bonita Springs Lot Mowing Ordinance. At that time, you were ordered to remove the nuisance grass and weeds within ten (10) days of receipt by mail, or risk the imposition of an assessment lien against the property for the full cost of abatement to the City. 
Since the violation was not abated in a timely fashion, the City Manager took steps necessary to remove the nuisance grass and weeds. At the present time, there is an impending assessment lien, which shall accrue interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum on any unpaid balance, if not paid within thirty (30) days from the date this notice was mailed. 
If the City has not received full payment, the City will record a special assessment lien against the property. The assessment lien will be a legal, valid and binding obligation. Once recorded, the assessment lien shall run with the land and must be satisfied upon sale, transfer or any other disposition of the property. This assessment together with interest thereon, may be enforced by civil action in a Lee County Court of appropriate jurisdiction. 
It is hereby requested that you immediately pay such assessment to the City Manager c/o Code Enforcement, 27300 Old 41 Road, Bonita Springs, FL 34135, and (239) 949-6257.

Sec. 28-45. - Penalty. 
(a)  Any person who violates any section of this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements may be prosecuted through code enforcement or by the county sheriff's office.

In certain cases restitution may be sought in lieu of fine and/or imprisonment. The code enforcement officers may, in addition, or alternatively, to pursuing criminal penalties or seeking injunctive relief, bring violations before the code enforcement hearing examiner, in accordance with all of the provisions of, and pursuant to, the enforcement procedures established under section 2-107 et seq. Each separate occurrence of a violation of this article shall constitute a separate violation, and shall be punishable as such. If a violation is brought to the hearing examiner in accordance with F.S. § 162.09, the fine schedule in section 28-47 will be used by the code enforcement officer when the person does not contest the violation.

(4)  The need to deter future violations.

Chapter 32 - SOLID WASTE[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The solid waste provisions are not included herein, but are on file in the city clerk's office. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 32-1. - Disaster debris removal from private communities. 
(a)  Intent and purpose. In the event of a disaster, the primary mission of the city will be to protect lives and property, restore governmental services and clear public streets. Depending on the magnitude of the disaster and after accomplishment of the primary mission, resources may be available to the city that may not be available to private residential communities. The intent and purpose of this section is to establish a process by which the city may evaluate and, if necessary, remove debris from private residential communities in the event of an immediate threat to life, public health and safety after a significant disaster. While the city recognizes that, as a general proposition, the removal of debris from private residential communities is the responsibility of the private community, there are occasions when, because of the magnitude of the disaster and the threat posed to life, health, and safety, there may be a compelling need to remove debris from private residential communities as described in this section. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly otherwise requires: 
    Debris shall include, but is not limited to, displaced, broken, or discarded building and construction materials, garbage, vegetative matter and spoiled or ruined household goods or materials. 
    Private residential community includes private streets and roads within a private homeowners, condominium or residential community that are not owned or controlled by a governmental entity. 
(c)  Private residential communities. Subsequent to a disaster and the declaration of a state of emergency by the mayor, the city may remove debris from private residential communities when such debris is determined to pose an immediate threat to the health, safety and welfare of the community. The mayor shall determine whether there is an immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare sufficient to warrant removal of debris on private streets in private residential communities in accordance with any one of the following standards: 
(1)  There is a significant likelihood that rescue vehicles will be significantly hindered from rendering emergency services to residential property should the debris be allowed to remain in place absent city removal. 
(2)  The type of debris is such that it may reasonably cause disease, illness, or sickness which could injure or adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of those residing in the area if it is allowed to remain. 
(3)  The clearing is necessary to effectuate orderly and expeditious restoration of city-wide utility services including, but not limited to, power, water, sewer, and telephone. 
(4)  The debris removal is necessary to eliminate immediate threats or significant damage to improved public or residential property. 
(5)  The debris prevents garbage collection thereby creating a public health hazard. 
(6)  The debris contains contaminants which have a reasonable likelihood of leeching into the soil and/or aquifer or other water bodies of the city. 
(7)  The debris has a substantial negative impact in preventing or adversely affecting emergency repairs to residential buildings and/or property. 
(8)  The debris presents a reasonable danger of being transported by wind and/or water into the surrounding areas of the city and thereby increasing the cost of recovery and removal. 
(9)  The debris poses a significant likelihood of, if left over time, producing mold which would be injurious to public health. 
(10)  The presence of the debris significantly adversely impacts the city's recovery efforts. 
(11)  The debris significantly interferes with drainage or water runoff, so as to be a significant hazard in the event of significant rainfall and removal of the debris is required to eliminate immediate threats of significant damage to improved public and private property. 
(12)  The sheer volume of the debris is such that it is impractical and unreasonable to remove in an orderly and efficient manner absent action by the city. 
(13)  The type, extent and nature of the debris is such that it would cause much greater damage if the debris was not removed immediately. 
(14)  The clearing of the debris is necessary to ensure the economic recovery of the affected community to the benefit of the community-at-large. 
(d)  Federal funding. Depending on the severity of the situation, with regard to eligibility for federal funding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may waive the requirement for the city to establish the criteria listed in subsection (c) as a condition precedent to city action or cost reimbursement. 
(e)  Indemnification and hold harmless. Prior to removal of debris by the city from private residential communities and other private property in accordance with this section, the property owner, community associations, homeowner or condominium association and/or governance boards shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the federal, state, and local government and all employees, officers and agents of the federal, state, and local government connected with the rendering of such service. 
(f)  Commercial and other areas. Commercial or other specific areas may be cleared if, in the opinion of the mayor, the clearance will aid the city's recovery operations or aid the health, safety, or welfare of the residents of the city and in the public interest. The indemnification and hold harmless provisions set forth in subsection (e) will be also applicable with respect to the property owners or associations for such commercial and other areas. The city acknowledges that commercial property debris removal is generally ineligible for reimbursement unless determined to be in the public interest and subject to the other private property provisions defined in FEMA's Disaster Assistance Policy for Debris Removal from Private Property, as amended from time to time. 
(g)  City property. An immediate threat of significant damage to city property or facilities shall be deemed to exist if the cost to remove the disaster-generated debris is less than the cost of potential damage to the city property or facility, thereby being a cost effective removal. 
(h)  Emergency roadway clearance. Nothing in this section shall preclude a first response by the city to clear and push debris from all roadways, both public and private, as necessary for the movement of emergency vehicles, including police, fire and ambulance and other emergency responders, within the first 70 hours after a disaster declaration. 
(i)  Private property. Nothing shall require the city to remove debris from private property and from areas within private residential communities other than from the private streets and roadways necessary for access to and egress from the residences and communities, except where the severity of the situation is of such magnitude or the debris is so widespread that it is determined by the mayor to be a significant immediate threat to the health, safety and welfare of the city and in the overriding public interest of the city to remove debris from such other areas. 
(j)  Gated communities. In the event of a hurricane warning, private residential communities must provide reasonable access for emergency vehicles and any debris removal vehicles and personnel. If the gates are unable to be opened for the emergency access, then the entrance gates are required to be secured in the open position to allow for access during the emergency event. This provision in no way obligates the city to remove any debris.

Information requested by the solid waste division staff shall be provided or made available to the solid waste division within 20 working days of a written request for any relevant, non-financial information from the business as may be needed to satisfy the requirements of this division. If the solid waste division inspects a business pursuant to this division, recycling program information shall be made available during the inspection. Upon inspection of the business premises, the solid waste division may inspect all relevant information related to the recycling program as necessary to verify sale or delivery of collected recyclable materials. If records are not kept on-site, the business owner will make them available within 20 business days of the solid waste division's written request. 
(d)  Temporary exemptions for recyclable materials . 
(1)  Commercial businesses on minimum refuse service as defined by the solid waste division are exempt from the requirements of this division. 
(2)  Limited exemptions, as set forth below, may be approved by the director or his designee. Applications for an exemption from the requirements of this division shall be submitted in writing to the director. An exemption may be allowed where compliance with this division would result in unnecessary hardship to the business and the need for an exemption would not be shared generally by other businesses. All exemptions are to be construed as temporary, for a period not to exceed one year, and shall be considered withdrawn on the first to occur of a change in the conditions which prompted the exemption, or the expiration of the time period granted in the exemption. Should an exemption be withdrawn because the time period has expired, an applicant may apply for renewal of the exemption. 
a.  Applications are evaluated against the following criteria: 
1.  Incompatibility of compliance with the requirements of this division and compliance with other city ordinances or other laws; 
2.  Unavailability of collectors or acceptors (defined as licensed haulers of recyclable materials or intermediate or final processors of recyclable materials); 
3.  Unavailability of on-site space for the separate and temporary storage of one or more of the required recyclable materials; 
4.  Extreme disparity between the applicant's costs of recycling one or more of the required materials and the costs of disposal of the same materials; 
5.  Negligible generation rates of one or more of the required recyclable materials; 
6.  Other conditions, in the opinion of the director, that are considered as adequate justification for adaptation consideration; 
7.  The director will consider these criteria in evaluating the application and will consider the compliance rate, implementation plans, and recycling programs of similar businesses in the city. The director will direct solid waste division staff to make a site visit and prepare a report on the applicant's property. 
b.  After reviewing the information described in subsection (d)(2)a of this section, the director may take one of the following actions: 
1.  Grant an adaptation that requires the applicant to recycle alternative materials identified by the director; 
2.  Grant an adaptation that reduces the number of types of materials required to be recycled; or 
3.  Deny the request for an adaptation. 
(e)  Compliance and enforcement for business recycling programs. 
(1)  An advance disposal fee (ADF) will be assessed monthly on each commercial location refuse billing statement for noncompliance with this division. These fees are outlined and on file in the city clerk's office. Commencement of billing will occur after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived. The solid waste generation rate category is the category that corresponds to the type of business (Florida DOR Classification) as set forth in County Ordinance No. 96-09 (adopted by the City of Bonita Springs) and the applicable waste generation range for such businesses per unit. Upon presentation of the information and materials required, the ADF may be waived for a business for a period of one year. Continued waiver of this fee is contingent on submittal of an exemption and approval by the solid waste division of an updated recycling program and appropriate agreements and provisions. 
(2)  In evaluating whether a violation of this division has occurred, solid waste division staff have the right to visit the business and determine the presence and capacity of recycling containers, the presence and quantities of recyclable materials in recycling containers, the presence of signs, flyers, stickers and other information which promotes recycling, and engage in discussion with employees, tenants and owners, and service providers regarding the business' recycling program. Any separation and storage of recyclable materials shall be undertaken in a location suitable and adequate for such activity. Separation and storage facilities shall comply with all applicable laws. 
(3)  The owner, unless he or she has otherwise arranged for and received approval from the solid waste division director for more time, will be given 20 business days from the date of the notification to provide the solid waste division with a written explanation of the pertinent events and circumstances relative to the alleged violation. 
(4)  The county solid waste division staff will be available for assistance in setting up a satisfactory recycling system and achieving compliance with this division. 
(5)  Should the owner, after the provided 20 business days, be found to continue to be in violation of this division, the owner will be assessed the advance disposal fee from the date of the initial violation until such time that the owner can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the director that the owner is again in compliance with this division. 
(6)  Should the owner be found to be in violation of this division due to a suspension of service due to nonpayment of invoices from the service provider, the owner will be assessed and amount on file in the city clerk's office for each violation from the date of the initial violation until such time that the owner can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the solid waste division staff that the owner is again in compliance with this division. 
(f)  Enforcement actions for business properties. The county solid waste division, code enforcement and the county sheriff's office have the concurrent authority and jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this division. In addition to the procedures and penalties set forth in this subsection (f), the city also has recourse to any remedies available at law or in equity, including injunctive relief and damages. 
(1)  Civil action. The city may take civil action to enforce the provisions of this division in accordance with the following procedures:

    Removal of any and all newsracks shall be determined by the following criteria: 
(1)  Upon determination by the code enforcement officer that a newsrack has been installed or maintained in violation of the provisions of this division, a notice of violation shall be issued to and served upon the distributor and, in the case of a newspaper vending machine, to the publisher of the respective newspaper. 
(2)  All notices of violation shall describe the nature of the violation and shall specify a reasonable time, not to exceed ten days, in which corrective action should be taken. In addition, a copy of the notice of violation shall be affixed on the respective newsrack. The notice shall give the owner the opportunity to first cure the violation or to request an informal hearing before the city council in reference to the violation, by requesting in writing to the city manager an appeal, which shall be heard within 30 days of filing the appeal. The decision of the city council is subject to judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(3)  Should any newsrack constitute a threat to public health or safety, the newsrack shall be subject to removal by the city within 48 hours, unless conditions warrant a shorter time period, following the issuance and service of a notice of violation accompanied by a notice of intent to remove the vending machine. Upon removal, the code enforcement officer shall deliver a notice of removal to the distributor and, in the case of a newspaper vending machine, to the newspaper publisher, such notice to describe the location from which the newsrack was removed, the address of the location where the newsrack is being stored and a brief explanation of the procedures by which the publisher or distributor may obtain a release of the newsrack. 
(4)  A newsrack removed hereunder shall be stored in a secure location for a period not to exceed 30 days. The newsrack shall be released to its owner, upon proof of ownership and payment of reasonable and actual storage charges. A pickup and collection charge, the amount of which is on file in the city clerk's office, will be assessed in addition to the actual and reasonable storage charge for any newsrack not picked up within 48 hours. If any newsrack is not claimed within 30 days, the newsrack shall be deemed abandoned and shall become the property of the city, and thereafter be sold at public auction. Approximately ten days prior to the auction, the city clerk shall furnish a description of the newsrack, the location from which it was removed and a notice of the auction in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. The proceeds of the sale shall be applied first to storage charges and then paid to the general fund of the city. The city may otherwise dispose of the newsrack in accordance with state law, as the city deems appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 00-11, § 5, 10-11-2000) 
Sec. 34-67. - Distance separation requirements. 
    Whenever a newsrack is located in a residential area or in a public right-of-way adjoining property zoned for residential use, regardless of the zoning of the public right-of-way, no additional vending machines containing the same issue or edition of the same publication shall be located within 1,000 feet of the installed newsrack. Provided, however, a distributor may locate newsracks in excess of this limitation by demonstrating a public need for the extra newsracks. A public need may be established by the following method, which method is not exclusive: 
A distributor desiring to establish a public need may place an extra newsrack at a proposed location, after notice to the city, for a test period of one month. If during that one-month test period the average circulation from that newsrack equals or exceeds 80 percent of the capacity of the newsrack, then a public need will be deemed to have been established and the newsrack may remain at the location until such time that circulation from that newsrack is below 80 percent.

Therefore, the APPB (art in public places board) should discuss physical and aesthetic considerations including the following: 
(1)  Art shall be located in areas where residents and visitors live and congregate and shall be in accordance with the goals of the public art master plan. 
(2)  The APPB should consider the impact of public art on the lives of those frequenting public places. Art reflecting enduring artistic concepts, not transitory ones, should be sought. 
(3)  The APPB's recommendations and selections must reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of this city without deviation from a standard of excellence. 
(4)  Final selection shall also take into account appropriateness to the site, permanence of the art in light of environmental conditions at the site, maintenance requirements, quality of art, likelihood that the artist can successfully complete the art within the available funding, diversity of art already acquired by the APPB, and diversity of the art required by the APPB. 
(c)  Supervision of contracts. The city manager or designee is responsible for contracting with the artist for the commission or purchase of art by the city. The contract is negotiated between the city, the originating agency and the artist and includes the following:

Sec. 34-169. - Scope and purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this division is to protect the comfort, health, repose, safety, and general welfare of residents of the city by establishing maximum parking areas in residential neighborhoods within the city. The criteria for the size and dimension of residential parking areas contained herein shall apply to all residential areas, including both city and privately maintained streets and roadways within such residential areas, except where a development order has been issued under chapter 3 of the Land Development Code that contains parking space size requirements more restrictive than those contained herein. The standards which constitute a nuisance under this division shall apply to all residential parking, regardless of the date the parking area or building was originally constructed, or whether a development order or building permit was issued or required. 
(b)  The requirements of this division are supplemental to standards that are found in other portions of the city Land Development Code and in other ordinances adopted by the city, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to the parking of recreational vehicles, mobile homes and commercial vehicles in residential areas.

(a)  For properties used for residential purposes and permitted after October 1, 2005, parking is limited to the driveway parking area meeting the dimensional requirements described below and leading from the permitted driveway connection to an enclosed parking area such as a garage or carport. If there is no garage or carport, the driveway parking area must meet the dimensional requirements below and be intended to provide parking and ingress and egress of vehicles. 
(b)  The maximum width of the driveway parking area shall be 18 feet where the driveway enters the street right-of-way, and the driveway parking area shall be limited to no more than 30 percent of the total front yard area, whichever is greater. The intent is to limit the area and retain at least 70 percent of the total front yard area to remain unpaved open greenspace (unless the 18 foot entrance creates less open space), and such greenspace shall not be used for the parking of any vehicles. In order to expedite vehicle ingress and egress to and from the street and the driveway, the driveway width at the point where it connects to the street pavement may be an additional three feet wider on each side of the driveway than it is at the street right-of-way line, and such additional areas shall not be included in the calculation for the driveway parking areas. 
(c)  Circular driveway parking areas may be no more than 40 percent of front yard open space provided the necessary driveway connections are allowed and that the circular drive extends to the right-of-way. The intent is to limit the area and retain at least 60 percent of the total front yard area to remain unpaved open greenspace (unless the 18 foot entrances create less open space), and such greenspace shall not be used for the parking of any vehicles. In order to expedite vehicle ingress and egress to and from the street and the driveway, the driveway width at the point where it connects to the street pavement may be an additional three feet wider on each side of the driveway than it is at the street right-of-way line, and such additional areas shall not be included in the calculation for the driveway parking areas. 
(d)  All unpaved parking areas and driveways must be graveled or covered with other erosion preventing material clearly defining the driveway and parking area, and have side borders of plants, landscape ties, pressure treated wood, brick or concrete or similar border materials. A minimum four feet width of hard surface material, such as concrete, asphalt or paver bricks, must be installed along paved city streets as a driveway apron adjacent to the street pavement. 
(e)  Any driveway that was built prior to October 1, 2005, that is used for residential use is hereby deemed to be a valid nonconforming use, subject to abandonment as defined in chapter 4 of the Land Development Code, as may be amended from time to time. In no event shall a driveway which is deemed a nonconforming use be extended or enlarged. 
(f)  Any new building permit applications submitted for single-family or duplex residential properties located within the city limits, after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived, shall, together with all building plans and other requirements, also require submittal of an application for a residential driveway permit, to include the location and dimensions of such driveway, and calculations showing that the proposed driveway and driveway parking areas will not exceed the permissible dimensional limitations set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(g)  Any building permit applications submitted for single-family or duplex residential properties which have already been applied for and filed with the city as of the effective date of this division, but where building permits have not yet been issued, shall, upon written notification by the city to the owner, also be subject to the above requirements, and such application for a residential driveway permit shall be filed within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived.

(1)  The driveway and driveway parking area are clearly defined; 
(2)  The driveway and driveway parking area are maintained in a safe, sanitary, neat condition; 
(3)  The driveway and driveway parking area does not contribute to soil erosion; and 
(4)  The requirements of this division would impose an inordinate burden to the property owner due to topographical road configuration constraints or other design constraints. 
(b)  Any decision of the city manager may be appealed to the city council by filing a written request within 15 days after the decision has been made. In reviewing such an appeal, city council will consider only information submitted for the city manager to base his decision, the facts presented, and the standards above. No additional evidence will be considered by city council. Prior to filing any claims under the Bert J. Harris, Jr., Private Property Rights Protection Act, an applicant must apply for an exemption to consider having exhausted his administrative remedies under this section before a cause of action or action of a governmental entity will accrue or be deemed ripe. Such exhaustion shall not include a filing for an appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari in circuit court. 
(c)  Nonowner-occupied residential rental units or dwellings with driveways built after October 1, 2005, must come into compliance with section 34-170 prior to the issuance of a rental permit, as required under the City Rental Permit Ordinance No. 07-22, as amended.

(4)  Placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way in support of collocation of small wireless facilities. A wireless infrastructure provider may apply to the city to place utility poles in the public rights-of-way to support the collocation of small wireless facilities. The application must include an attestation that small wireless facilities will be collocated on the utility pole or structure and will be used by a wireless services provider to provide service within nine months after the date the application is approved by the city. The city shall accept and process the application in accordance with this chapter and any applicable codes and other local codes governing the placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way. 
(5)  Application and enforcement of historic preservation zoning regulations. Consistent with preservation of local zoning authority under 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7), the requirements for facility modifications under 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, this chapter is subject to the provisions of City Codes and ordinances regarding historic preservation. 
(6)  Prohibited collocations, attachments, installations, and services not authorized by this section. This section does not authorize, and the city hereby prohibits, the following: 
a.  This section does not authorize a person to collocate or attach wireless facilities, including any antenna, micro wireless facility, or small wireless facility, on a privately-owned utility pole, a utility pole owned by an electric cooperative or a municipal electric utility, a privately-owned wireless support structure, or other private property without the consent of the property owner. 
b.

Sec. 38-12. - Fees applicable to those not subject to communications services tax. 
    While the Florida Legislature has prohibited municipalities from requiring providers of communications services who have registered with the Florida Department of Revenue from having to enter into franchise agreements or license arrangements as a condition to placing or maintaining communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, the city expressly reserves the right to require the payment of consideration or regulatory fees by persons using or occupying the public rights-of-way in other capacities. The city reserves the right to require such payments based on the type of user and to the extent as follows: 
(1)  Dealer. Except as provided in paragraph (23) of section 38-6, a communications services provider who meets the definition of dealer as set forth in this this chapter and who has registered in accordance with section 38-3 is not required to enter into a franchise agreement or license arrangement with the city as a condition to placing or maintaining communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, nor is a dealer required to make payment of any franchise fees, license fees, or other user fees to the city as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the provision of communications services. 
(2)  Pass-through provider and pass-through facilities. A communications services provider who meets the definition of pass-through provider as set forth in this chapter and who is not subject to the city's local communications services tax imposed pursuant to F.S. §§ 202.19 and 202.20, shall pay the city the maximum annual amount allowed under F.S. § 337.401(6)(b), as amended. For purposes of calculating payments hereunder, each separate utility pole or tower installed or maintained by a pass-through provider for purposes of supporting antennas for other over-the-air radio transmission or reception equipment in the public rights-of-way shall comprise a separate communications facility subject to assessment of a separate permit fee in the amount of $500.00 per linear mile, or portion thereof, up to the maximum amount allowed under F.S. § 337.401(6)(b), whichever is higher. The annual amount referred to above shall be due and payable on October 1 of every year beginning on October 1, 2018. Fees not paid within ten days after the due date shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date due until paid. The acceptance of any payment required hereunder by the city shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the amount paid is the correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for additional sums due and payable or authorization to install any facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(3)  Other persons. All other persons, except a government, are required to pay the city, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities, an amount based on and in accordance with section 38-12(2). 
(4)  Government. A government is not required to pay the city consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities, unless such facilities are being used by such government or a communications services provider, including resellers, to offer or provide communication services other than for such government's internal non-commercial use, in which event the government, where not subject to the city's local communications services tax imposed pursuant to F.S. §§ 202.19 and 202.20, is required to pay the city, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way by or through its communications facilities placed therein after October 1, 2017, an amount based on and in accordance with section 38-12(2), or such other amount or rate of compensation as mutually agreed to in writing by the government and the city.

Insurance policies and certificates issued by non-admitted insurance companies are not acceptable. All liability policies shall name the city, its council members, officers, and employees as additional insureds with respect to any covered liability arising out of the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way or other activities under this chapter. Each communications services provider shall furnish annually to the city certificates showing proof of all required insurance coverage. All liability coverage must be in occurrence form and in accordance with the limits specified. Claims made policies are not acceptable. No insurance policy shall be canceled, nor shall the occurrence or aggregate limits set forth herein be reduced, until the city has received at least 30 days' advance written notice by registered, certified, or regular mail or facsimile of any cancellation, intent not to renew, or reduction in policy coverage. Each communications services provider shall be responsible for notifying the city of such cancellation, intent not to renew, or reduction in coverage. All certificate(s) of insurance, including all endorsements and riders, evidencing insurance coverage shall be submitted to the city within 30 days after the date of registration with the city in order for a communications services provider to obtain a permit required for construction in the public rights-of-way.

(1)  The policy number; name of insurance company; name and address of the agent or authorized representative; name and address of insured; that the policy coverage "pertains to the requirements of Section 38014"; policy expiration date; and specific coverage amounts; 
(2)  Any applicable deductibles or self-insured retentions; 
(3)  That the city, its council members, officers, and employees are additional insureds; 
(4)  That the city shall receive 30 days' advance written notice of cancellation, intent not to renew, or reduction in coverage; and 
(5)  That the commercial general liability insurance policy is primary as respects any other valid or collectible insurance that the city may possess, including any self-insured retentions the city may have; and any other insurance the city does possess shall be considered excess insurance only and shall not be required to contribute with this insurance. 
(d)  Under extraordinary circumstances a communications services provider may satisfy the insurance requirements of this section by providing documentation of self-insurance that, in the sole discretion of the city's director of human resources and risk management, demonstrates incontrovertibly the adequacy to defend and cover claims of any nature that might arise from the placement and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way. The communications services provider must be authorized as a self-insurer by the department of insurance under the laws of the State of Florida.

The city will attempt to notify the communications services provider, in writing, within a reasonable time of the city's receiving notice of any issue it determines may require indemnification. 
(d)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted: (1) as denying the city, the communications services provider, or any person any remedy or defense available to them under the laws of the State of Florida; or (2) as a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the waiver provided in F.S. § 768.28, as it may be amended.

The construction bond shall serve to guarantee the timeliness and quality of the construction and restoration work and to secure, and enable the city to recover, all costs related to the restoration of the public rights-of-way in the event the communications services provider or its contractor fails to make such restoration to the city's satisfaction or causes damage to the public rights-of-way during construction. The construction bond must name the city as obligee and be in the face amount of either $15,000.00 or 110 percent of the estimated cost of the project, whichever is greater, conditioned upon the full and faithful completion of construction and restoration of the public rights-of-way to the delineated specifications stipulated in the permit.

However, for any subsequent work in the public rights-of-way, the communications services provider or its contractor will be required to replenish any existing construction bond or provide a new construction bond in the face amount of $15,000.00. The construction bond shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney and must be issued by a surety having a rating reasonably acceptable to the city manager and authorized by the Florida Department of Insurance to issue surety bonds in this state. 
(b)  The construction bond must be issued as non-cancelable and be for a term of not less than 12 months. In the event the term of any construction bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to the completion of construction, restoration, and city inspection, the communications services provider, or the contractor acting on its behalf, shall immediately obtain, pay for, and file with the city a replacement bond. 
(c)  The city's requirement of a construction bond is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required under this chapter or through the permitting process. The city's right to recover under the construction bond shall be in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved in this chapter, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to the construction bond will affect or preclude any other right the city may have.

The city's right to recover under the performance bond shall be in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved in this chapter, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to the performance bond will affect or preclude any other right the city may have. Any proceeds recovered under the performance bond may be used to reimburse the city for such additional expenses as may be incurred by the city as a result of the communications services provider's failure to comply with the responsibilities imposed by this chapter, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and costs of any action or proceeding, and the cost of removal or abandonment of any property.

(c)  The city supplements the provisions of F.A.C. ch. 40E-24, as follows: 
(1)  F.A.C. 40E-24.201(5)(a). Landscape irrigation shall be prohibited daily between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Any irrigation performed from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. will be subject to fines. Irrigation during these hours wilts sod and plants and wastes water through evaporation. 
(2)  Persons using a low volume irrigation system will be allowed to water seven days a week except during the hours between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Low volume irrigation systems include systems such as misting and drip irrigation systems which are specifically designed to allow the volume of water delivered to be limited to a level consistent with the water requirement of the plant being irrigated and to allow that water to be placed with a high degree of efficiency in the root zone of the plant, thereby conserving water. 
(3)  The low-volume hand watering methods referenced in F.A.C. 40E-24.201(5)(f) shall be fitted with an automatic shutoff device. The use of handheld watering devices are exempt from this article providing that self-shutting nozzles are used. At no time will an open hose be allowed to flow freely unattended, wasting water.

(b)  Penalties. 
(1)  Violation of any provisions of this article shall be subject to the following penalties: 
a.  First violation: $25.00 fine. 
b.  Second violation: $100.00 fine. 
c.  Third violation: Fine not to exceed $500.00 and/or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed 60 days.

(a)  Gray water, as defined in F.S. § 381.0065 and gray water systems are described in F.A.C. 64E-6.013(4). The city will permit gray water installation meeting Appendix C of the plumbing portion of the Florida Building Code and the applicable Florida Administrative Codes, as amended. 
(b)  The city encourages property owners to utilize alternative on-site wastewater and water reuse technologies. These reuse technologies include the use of gray water harvesting through the use of rain barrels, water cisterns and air conditioning condensate for irrigation. The reason for this is to integrate alternative reuse technologies into the existing water supply infrastructure as an offset to the potable water supply. 
(Ord. No. 15-23 , § 1, 11-18-2015) 
Sec. 42-54. - Ornamental water features. 
(a)  Ornamental water features can be installed as long as they recirculate water and serve a beneficial use such as cooling, wildlife habitat, stormwater management, and/or noise reduction. The water consumption of an ornamental water feature can be reduced if smaller pumps, lower pumping rates, and/or pressure-reducing valves are used to reduce water flow. The higher the water flow, the more water wasted due to evaporation. 
(b)  Ornamental water features include fountains, ponds, waterfalls, manmade streams, and other decorative water-related constructions.

ARTICLE 4. - STORMWATER IMPROVEMENT ASSESSMENTS 
 
Sec. 48-201. - Stormwater improvement assessments [authorized]. 
The council is hereby authorized to impose stormwater improvement assessments to fund all or any portion of the capital cost of a stormwater improvement identified in any stormwater basin plan and the associated stormwater improvement collection costs. Stormwater improvement assessments may be imposed against all parcels of property within the stormwater improvement area at a rate of assessment based upon the special benefit accruing to such property from the stormwater improvement, measured by the number of ERUs attributable to each parcel or classification of property. 
(1)  If the council expects to issue permanent obligations to finance the capital cost of the stormwater improvements, the stormwater improvement assessments for any stormwater improvement assessment roll that will be certified for collection prior to issuance of such permanent obligations shall be computed and applied as follows: 
a.  Prior to adoption of the initial stormwater improvement assessment resolution, the stormwater program director shall direct the preparation of a pro forma schedule of the permanent obligations required to finance the capital cost of the stormwater improvements utilizing the following assumptions: 
1.  The principal amount of the pro forma permanent obligations is at least sufficient to fund: 
i.  Interest to accrue on such permanent obligations from their expected date of issuance to the first interest payment date that occurs during the fiscal year following that in which the stormwater improvements to be constructed from the proceeds of such permanent obligations are scheduled for completion; 
ii.  Payment of the transaction cost; 
iii.  Amounts to be deposited in any reserve account established for the permanent obligations; and 
iv.  The estimated capital cost for the stormwater improvements; 
2.  The permanent obligations are payable in substantially equal annual payments over a period not exceeding 30 years from their expected date of issuance; and 
3.  The permanent obligations bear interest at rates not exceeding two full percentage points in excess of the rates such permanent obligations would bear, in the reasonable judgment of the city or its financial advisor, on the date the pro forma schedule of permanent obligations is prepared. 
b.  Based upon the pro forma schedule of permanent obligations, the annual stormwater improvement assessment for each ERU shall be computed as (a) the ERU's share of (i) the maximum annual debt service for the pro forma schedule of permanent obligations, (ii) any anticipated credit enhancement or similar fees not to be funded from proceeds of the permanent obligations, and (iii) the stormwater improvement collection costs, divided by (b) the factor of 0.95, reflecting the percentage of reasonably anticipated receipts the city is permitted to appropriate pursuant to F.S. § 129.01(2)(b). The annual stormwater improvement assessment for each parcel or classification of property shall be computed by multiplying the stormwater improvement assessment for each ERU by the number of ERUs attributable to such parcel or classification of property. 
c.  Proceeds from the stormwater improvement assessments received during each fiscal year shall be applied by the city as follows: 
1.  Payment of the associated stormwater improvement collection cost; 
2.  Payment of the capital cost for the stormwater improvements; 
3.  Payment of the actual debt service on interim obligations attributable to the stormwater improvements becoming due during such fiscal year; and 
4.  Prepayment of the interim obligations attributable to the stormwater improvements. 
(2)  The annual stormwater improvement assessment for any stormwater improvement assessment roll that will be certified for collection after the issuance of permanent obligations to finance the stormwater improvements shall be computed as (i) the sum of the ERU's share of (a) the annual debt service for the permanent obligations, (b) any anticipated credit enhancement or similar fees not to be funded from proceeds of the permanent obligations, (c) any deficiency in the collection of annual debt service for the permanent obligations in the prior fiscal year (deficiency for this purpose being defined as collection of any amount less than annual debt service for the permanent obligations divided by 0.95), (d) the amount of any principal of and interest on permanent obligations that has become due and remains unpaid, and (e) the stormwater improvement collection costs, divided by (ii) the factor of 0.95, reflecting the percentage of reasonably anticipated receipts the city is permitted to appropriate pursuant to F.S. § 129.01(2)(b). For purposes of determining the debt service, the council may assume that the permanent obligations bear interest at a rate not greater than one full percentage point in excess of their actual rate. The annual stormwater improvement assessment for each parcel or classification of property shall be computed by multiplying the stormwater improvement assessment for each ERU by the number of ERUs attributable to such parcel or classification of property. 
(3)  If obligations will not be issued to finance the capital cost of the stormwater improvements, the stormwater improvement assessments shall be computed and applied as follows: 
a.  The annual stormwater improvement assessment for each ERU shall be computed as (a) the sum of each ERU's share of the capital cost to be funded during the fiscal year and the associated stormwater improvement collection costs, divided by (b) the factor of 0.95, reflecting the percentage of reasonably anticipated receipts the city is permitted to appropriate pursuant to F.S. § 129.01(2)(b). The annual stormwater improvement assessment for each parcel of property shall be computed by multiplying the stormwater improvement assessment for each ERU by the number of ERUs attributable to such parcel. 
b.  Proceeds from the stormwater improvement assessments received during each fiscal year shall be applied to payment of the capital cost for the stormwater improvements and the associated stormwater improvement collection cost. 
(4)  Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to require or preclude the imposition of stormwater improvement assessments against government property. 
( Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, 7-17-2019 )  
Sec. 48-202. - Initial proceedings.

All delinquent property owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in collection of such delinquent stormwater assessments, and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent stormwater assessments, including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility, and the same shall be collectible as a part of, or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent stormwater assessment, and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided, however, that: 
a.  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by law and this article; and 
b.  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent stormwater assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the stormwater service assessment roll or stormwater improvement assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
( Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, 7-17-2019 )  
Sec. 48-253. - Responsibility for enforcement. 
The city and its agent, if any, shall maintain the duty to enforce the prompt collection of stormwater assessments by the means provided herein. The duties related to collection of stormwater assessments may be enforced at the suit of any holder of obligations in a court of competent jurisdiction by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings or actions. 
( Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, 7-17-2019 )  
Sec. 48-254. - Government property. 
(a)  If stormwater assessments are imposed against government property, the city shall provide stormwater assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(1)  A brief explanation of the stormwater assessment; 
(2)  A description of the ERU or other unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the stormwater assessment;

(5)  The location at which payment will be accepted; and 
(6)  The date on which the stormwater assessment is due. 
(b)  Stormwater assessments imposed against governmental property shall be due on the same date as all other stormwater assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(c)  A stormwater assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment is due. The city shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its stormwater assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in collection of such delinquent stormwater assessments, and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent stormwater assessments, including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility, and the same shall be collectible as a part of, or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e)  As an alternative to the foregoing, a stormwater assessment imposed against government property may be collected on the bill for any utility service provided to such governmental property. The council may contract for such billing services with any utility not owned by the city.

Sec. 48-302. - Terms of the obligations. 
The obligations shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, and shall mature at such times as may be determined by resolution of the council, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the city, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the council. Said obligations shall mature not later than 40 years after their issuance and may, at the option of the council, bear interest at a variable rate. The council shall determine by resolution the form of the obligations, and the manner of executing such obligations, and shall fix the denominations of such obligations, the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside of the State of Florida, and such other terms and provisions of the obligations as it deems appropriate. The obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the council shall determine by resolution. The obligations may be delivered to any contractor to pay for his work in constructing the stormwater improvements or may be sold in such manner and for such price as the council may determine by resolution to be for the best interests of the city. 
( Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, 7-17-2019 )  
Sec. 48-303. - Variable rate obligations. 
The city may, at its option, issue obligations bearing a variable rate of interest. In such event, the city shall adopt a resolution to designate the interest rate used to compute the stormwater improvement assessments; provided, however, that if the resolution authorizing issuance of the obligations establishes a maximum rate of interest, the rate of interest used to compute the stormwater improvement assessments shall not exceed such maximum rate. If, for any fiscal year, the actual rate of interest on the obligations is less than the rate of interest used to compute the stormwater improvement assessments, the excess amounts shall be credited to the next installment of the stormwater improvement assessment or be returned to the property owners who paid such amounts, as provided by resolution of the council. If, for any fiscal year, the actual rate of interest on the obligations exceeds the rate of interest used to compute the stormwater improvement assessments, such deficiency may be imposed as a surcharge on the next annual installment.

Prior to the preparation of definitive obligations of any series, the council may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary obligations, exchangeable for definitive obligations when such obligations have been executed and are available for delivery. The council may also provide for the replacement of any obligations which shall become mutilated, destroyed or lost. Obligations may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this article.

Sec. 48-305. - Anticipation notes. 
In anticipation of the sale of obligations, the council may, by resolution, issue notes and may renew the same from time to time. Such notes may be paid from the proceeds of the obligations, the proceeds of the stormwater improvement assessments, the proceeds of the notes and such other legally available moneys as the council deems appropriate by resolution. Said notes shall mature within five years of their issuance and shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding the maximum rate provided by law. The council may issue obligations or renewal notes to repay the notes. The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the obligations. 
( Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, 7-17-2019 )  
Sec. 48-306. - Taxing power not pledged. 
Obligations issued under the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the city, but such obligations shall be payable only from pledged revenue and, if applicable, proceeds of the stormwater service assessments, in the manner provided herein and by the resolution authorizing the obligations. The issuance of obligations under the provisions of this article shall not directly or indirectly obligate the city to levy or to pledge any form of ad valorem taxation whatever therefor. No holder of any such obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the ad valorem taxing power on the part of the city to pay any such obligations or the interest thereon or to enforce payment of such obligations or the interest thereon against any property of the city, nor shall such obligations constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the city, except the pledged revenue. 
( Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, 7-17-2019 )  
Sec. 48-307. - Trust funds. 
The pledged revenue received pursuant to the authority of this article shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided in this article and in the resolution authorizing issuance of the obligations. Such pledged revenue may be invested by the city, or its designee, in the manner provided by the resolution authorizing issuance of the obligations. The pledged revenue, upon receipt thereof by the city, shall be subject to the lien and pledge of the holders of any obligations or any entity other than the city providing credit enhancement on the obligations. 
( Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, 7-17-2019 )  
Sec. 48-308. - Remedies of holders. 
Any holder of obligations, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by the resolution authorizing issuance of the obligations, may, whether at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state or granted hereunder or under such resolution, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this part [article], or by such resolution, to be performed by the city. 
( Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, 7-17-2019 )  
Sec. 48-309. - Refunding obligations. 
The city may, by resolution of the council, issue obligations to refund any obligations issued pursuant to this article, or any other obligations of the city theretofore issued to finance the capital cost of a stormwater improvement, and provide for the rights of the holders thereof. Such refunding obligations may be issued in an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding obligations to be refunded. If the issuance of such refunding obligations results in an annual stormwater improvement assessment that exceeds the estimated maximum annual assessment set forth on the preliminary assessment roll prepared pursuant to section 48-204, the council shall provide notice to the affected property owners and conduct a public hearing in the manner required by article 3 of chapter 48.

PREFACE 
    This Land Development Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent land development ordinances of the City of Bonita Springs, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the land development ordinances adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Land Development Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Land Development Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in an order typical of Land Development Codes, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Land Development Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Land Development Code is included at the back of this Volume. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Land Development Code is the typical system used in many local governments for Land Development Codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Land Development Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Land Development Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of land development codes, which may or may not appear in this Land Development Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE LDC1:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE APPENDIX LDCA:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES LDCCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE INDEX LDCi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A.Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Paula Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Dianne Lynn, City Clerk/Diretor of Administrative Services, Audrey Vance, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

THE CITY OF BONITA SPRINGS HEREBY ORDAINS: 
    Section 1. The Code entitled "City of Bonita Springs, Florida Land Development Code," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 9, each inclusive, is adopted. 
    Section 2. All land development ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before May 7, 2014, and not included in the Land Development Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. General penalty; continuing violations. 
A.  The phrase "violation of this Land Development Code" means any of the following: 
1.  Doing an act that is prohibited or made or declared unlawful, an offense or a misdemeanor by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance. 
2.  Failure to perform an act that is required to be performed by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance. 
3.  Failure to perform an act if the failure is declared a misdemeanor or an offense or unlawful by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance.

With respect to violations of this Land Development Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues constitutes a separate offense in the absence of provisions to the contrary. 
D.  Any violation of this Land Development Code that arose from provisions that are subsequently repealed and reenacted will continue to be a violation of this Code and any penalties imposed for those violations will continue to exist unless the subsequent amendment or repeal of the violated provisions clearly intends to make previous violations legal and expressly voids any penalties imposed for those violations.

(a)  In the construction of this Land Development Code, and of all ordinances, the rules and definitions set out in this section shall be observed, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the city council. The rules of construction in this section do not apply to any section of this Land Development Code that contains any express provisions excluding their application, or where the subject matter or context of such section may be repugnant thereto. 
(b)  Generally. 
(1)  All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this Land Development Code will be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the city council may be fully carried out. 
(2)  Terms used in this Land Development Code, unless otherwise specifically provided, have the meanings prescribed by the statutes of the State of Florida for the same terms. 
(3)  In the event of any difference in meaning or implication between the text of this Land Development Code and any caption, illustration, summary table or illustrative table, the text shall control. 
(4)  Any words used in the present tense shall include the future; and any words in the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary; and words of the masculine gender shall be construed to include the feminine gender and vice versa. 
(5)  Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a regulation involves two or more items, conditions, provisions or events connected by the conjunction "and," "or" or "either ... or," the conjunction shall be interpreted as follows:

With respect to violations of this Land Development Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues constitutes a separate offense in the absence of provisions to the contrary. For violation of this Code or any misdemeanor law of the state adopted by the city, if it appears to the court upon a hearing of the matter that the defendant is not likely again to engage in a violation of this Code and that the ends of justice and the welfare of society do not require that the defendant shall presently suffer the penalty imposed by this section and after a finding by the court that supervision in the community is necessary to provide adequate protection to the community or to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender or both, the court, in its discretion, may either adjudge the defendant to be guilty or stay and withhold the adjudication of guilt and in either case stay and withhold the imposition of sentence upon such defendant and shall place the defendant upon probation.

(f)  The imposition of a penalty does not prevent revocation or suspension of a license, permit or franchise, the imposition of civil penalties, or other administrative actions. 
(g)  Violations of this Land Development Code may be abated by injunctive or other equitable or civil relief, and no bond nor proof of intent or scienter shall be required. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent equitable relief.

Compliance agreements may be executed at the discretion of the city manager or designee. However, the city is under no obligation to enter into a compliance agreement.

The city may, at its option, record the compliance agreement in the public records. If a copy of the agreement is recorded, the city will record a satisfaction or release of the agreement once the violation is deemed abated. The parties must comply with all terms of the agreement, in the stated time frame, before the violation will be deemed abated. In the event the parties fail to comply with the terms of the agreement, the city may pursue code enforcement action. If the city pursues code enforcement action subsequent to the execution of the compliance agreement, the terms of the agreement will have no further effect on the parties and will not be binding on the hearing examiner. 
(d)  Enforcement. The terms and conditions of a compliance agreement may be enforced in a court of competent jurisdiction by injunction or an action for specific performance. In the event the parties execute, but do not perform all obligations under an agreement, the city may pursue code enforcement hearing examiner action in accordance with article XI. The hearing examiner is not responsible for the enforcement of compliance agreement obligations.

(g)  Property owner withdrawal of consent. The property owner may withdraw its consent to the permit at any time by submitting a letter instructing the city to cancel the permit. The letter must include evidence that the restaurant owner received notice of this withdrawal and the cancel date for the permit. The property owner may reinstate consent within 30 days from the cancel date, otherwise, a new permit application must be submitted to accommodate patrons' dogs.

(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-44), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-44), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-29. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Building permit means an official document or certification that authorizes the construction, alteration, enlargement, conversion, reconstruction, remodeling, rehabilitation, erection, demolition, moving or repair of a building or structure. 
    Certificate of concurrency compliance means the certification issued by the director pursuant to section 2-30(d). This certification means that the director has determined that there is or will be sufficient public facilities to serve the development for which a development permit has been requested without violating the minimum concurrency standards set forth in the Lee Plan. 
    Certificate of concurrency exemption means the certification issued by the director pursuant to section 2-30(b). This certification means that the director has determined that a type of development order, or a specific development order issued for a proposed development permit, is exempt from the concurrency levels of service requirements of the Bonita Plan. The issuance of a certificate of concurrency exemption does not exempt a developer from submission of project data required by the director unless specifically set forth in the certificate. Submission of project data assists the city in monitoring anticipated impacts on public facilities for the purposes of maintaining an inventory to evaluate new requests for development. 
    Concurrency certificate means a certificate of concurrency compliance, a certificate of concurrency exemption, a concurrency variance certificate or a conditional certificate of concurrency compliance. 
    Concurrency variance certificate means the certification issued by the director pursuant to section 2-34. This certification means that the director has determined that a variance from the strict concurrency requirements of the Bonita Plan must be granted with respect to a specific development permit to avoid the unconstitutional taking of property without due process of law. 
    Conditional certificate of concurrency compliance means a certificate issued by the director pursuant to section 2-30(k). This certification means that the director has determined that: 
(1)  A development permit, which otherwise would violate the minimum concurrency requirements of the Bonita Plan, can be issued consistent with the Bonita Plan if certain conditions are attached to the permit; or 
(2)  The application for concurrency review is complete but for a particular document that can be submitted prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy. 
    Constrained roads means those roadway segments that cannot or will not be widened due to community scenic, historic, aesthetic, right-of-way or environmental constraints. 
    De minimus transportation impact means an impact created by a use that would not affect more than one percent of the maximum volume at the adopted level of service of the affected transportation facility as determined by the city. No impact will be considered de minimus if the impact would exceed the adopted level of service standard of an affected designated hurricane evacuation route. 
    Developer means any person, including a governmental agency, undertaking any development. 
    Development means the carrying out of building activity, the making of any material change in the use or appearance of any structure or land, or the dividing of land into three or more parcels. It is intended to have the same meaning given in F.S. § 380.04. 
    Development order means any order granting or granting with conditions an application for a development permit. 
    Development permit means a building permit, subdivision approval, certification or variance or other official action of local government having the effect of permitting the development of land. This definition conforms to that set forth in F.S. § 163.3164(7), except that it does not include zoning permits, zoning variances, rezoning, special exceptions, preliminary plan approvals, and special permits which, by themselves, do not permit the development of land. 
    Director means the city manager, or any other person designated by the city manager to exercise the authority or assume the responsibilities given the director in this article. 
    Equivalent residential connections means the total number of meter equivalents using the methodology of the state public service commission. The term "equivalent residential connections" is synonymous with the term "equivalent residential units" used by the state public service commission. 
    Long-term transportation concurrency management system means a financially feasible system to ensure that existing deficiencies are corrected within a specified time frame and to establish priorities for addressing backlogged facilities in special concurrency districts or areas. 
    Mobile home move-on permit means an official document or certification authorizing a purchaser, owner, mover, installer or dealer to move a mobile home onto a particular site. The term "mobile home move-on permit" also includes a permit authorizing the tiedown of a park trailer in a mobile home zoning district. Mobile homes and park trailers are defined in chapter 4. 
    Multimodal transportation district means areas designated under the Bonita Plan where community design features reduce the use of private vehicles and support an integrated multimodal transportation system. Multimodal transportation districts are designated in accordance with F.S. § 163.3180(15). 
    Permanent traffic means the traffic that a development can reasonably be expected to generate on a continuing basis upon completion of the development. The term "permanent traffic" does not mean the temporary construction traffic. 
    Planned development rezoning means any rezoning to a planned development zoning district pursuant to chapter 4. 
    Preliminary development order means a preliminary development order issued by the city. 
    Preliminary plan approval means a type of site plan approval pursuant to chapter 3 that does not authorize development and to which no concurrency vesting attaches. 
    Regulatory standards means the minimum acceptable level of service as set forth in the Bonita Plan. 
    School concurrency means that public school facilities needed to serve new development must be in place or under actual construction within three years after the local government approves a development permit, or its functional equivalent, that results in a generation of students. 
    Transportation concurrency means that transportation facilities needed to serve new development must be in place or under actual construction within three years after the local government approves a development permit, or its functional equivalent, that results in traffic generation. 
    Transportation concurrency exception areas means areas designated under the Bonita Plan that allow exceptions to the transportation concurrency management requirement to promote urban infill development, urban redevelopment, or downtown revitalization. 
    Transportation concurrency management areas means compact geographic areas designated under the Bonita Plan with existing or proposed multiple, viable alternative travel paths or modes for common trips, which employ the use of an area-wide level of service standard and an accommodation and management of traffic congestion for the purpose of promoting infill development or redevelopment in a manner that supports more efficient mobility alternatives. 
(Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-45), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-30. - Concurrency certification. 
(a)  Review for compliance with level of service requirements. 
(1)  All applications for final development orders and building permits must be reviewed by the city manager or designee for compliance with the level of service requirements set forth in the city comprehensive plan. Exceptions to this provision are development permits that are: 
a.  Specifically exempted from concurrency review by the city administrative code; 
b.  Granted pursuant to a concurrency variance certificate under section 2-34; 
c.  A concurrency exemption certificate applies under section 2-34; 
d.  Related to development pursuant to a development order issued under F.S. §§ 380.06 and 380.061, and the DRI development order separately provides for concurrency compliance and analysis; or 
e.  Granted pursuant to a development agreement in effect, and the development agreement makes separate provision for concurrency compliance and analysis. 
(2)  Upon application and payment of the application fee set by the city council by ordinance, the city manager or designee will determine whether the public facilities and services listed in F.S. § 163.3180 needed to support the development will be available concurrent with the impacts of that development, or whether the development should be exempted from such a determination, either because the development will not have an impact on the public facilities and services or because the applicant for the development permit has a vested right to receive it. 
(b)  Determination of exemption. Certain types of development permits do not cause additional impacts on public facilities and services. These development permits should be exempt from concurrency compliance. The city manager or designee will be guided by the standards set forth in this article. If the city manager or designee finds that the standards for exemption have been satisfied, he will certify his findings by a written statement that identifies the development permit for which the specific determination of exemption has been made. The city manager's or designee's statement must recite the basis for his determination by reference to the facts upon which he is relying and the sections of this article he finds to be controlling. The city manager's or designee's statement will be known as a certificate of concurrency exemption, will identify a development order or will be limited to the exact development permit application for which he has issued his certificate. Applications for an amendment to a development order granting a development permit for which a certificate of concurrency exemption has been issued will require another, separate concurrency review by the city manager or designee. 
(c)  Consideration of impacts. If the city manager or designee determines that a development permit is not exempt from the minimum concurrency requirements of the city comprehensive plan, the city manager or designee will consider the impact the development will have on potable water, sanitary sewer, surface water management, solid waste disposal, parks and recreation and roadway facilities. The city manager or designee will consider the type and intensity of use of the proposed development in relation to the demands and intensity of the use that can reasonably be expected to make on those facilities and the times when the demand can reasonably be expected to occur during the course of the development. When measuring the expected impacts of a development, the city manager or designee will include only the impacts of permanent traffic (see definitions) and other similar continuing infrastructure demands of the development. The city manager or designee will disregard temporary impacts such as fire flow tests. The city manager or designee may rely upon studies, measurements or calculations prepared by qualified professionals, or upon generally accepted guidelines, rules, formulas, studies or other theories developed by professional experts working or publishing in this field of inquiry, or upon relevant historical trends or experiences, or upon related rules and standards adopted by other governmental agencies, or upon any combination of these sources. The burden of disproving the accuracy of the city manager's or designee's determination lies with the person who disputes it. To promote uniformity in the application of this subsection, the city manager or designee may prepare administrative rules prescribing the methodology by which the impacts of a proposed development will be determined. Those rules will be set forth in an administrative code adopted by the city council. 
(d)  Determination of sufficient capacity. Once the city manager or designee has considered the impacts of a proposed development in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, he will then determine whether there will be sufficient capacity for these facilities to serve the development at the time the impacts of the development will occur without causing these facilities and services to function at a level of service below the minimum regulatory levels established for these facilities and services in the city comprehensive plan. Except for traffic impacts, which will be determined in accordance with the appropriate policies of the city comprehensive plan, the city manager or designee will add the expected impacts of the development to the levels of use of the facility at the time of the determination. Anticipated additional use will be derived from other reasonably foreseeable factors. If this sum is less than the capacity of the facility in question to operate during the effective period of a certificate of concurrency compliance at the minimum regulatory levels of services prescribed in the city comprehensive plan and the development's projected traffic is in compliance with the appropriate policies of the comprehensive plan, the city manager or designee will certify the conclusion by a written statement. The written statement will identify the development in question and the development permit for which the certification has been made. The city manager's or designee's statement will be known as a certificate of concurrency compliance and is limited to the exact development permit application for which he has issued his certificate. Applications for an amendment to a development order granting a development permit for which a certificate of concurrency compliance has been issued will require another, separate concurrency review by the city manager or designee. 
(e)  Means of measuring level of service in relation to location of development. When measuring the availability of a public facility to serve a development, the level of service at which the facility is operating or is expected to operate will be measured in relation to its location to the development as follows: 
(1)  Potable water. Supply and treatment capacity will be based on the number of equivalent residential connections of the utility that will provide service to the development. The pressure in the distribution system will be measured at the point where the service enters the development or at the point from which the service will be extended. 
(2)  Sanitary sewer. The treatment and disposal capacity will be based on the number of equivalent residential connections of the utility that will provide service to the development. The capacity of the collection system will be measured at the point where the service enters the development or at the point from which the service will be extended. 
(3)  Surface water management. Runoff capacity for new development is required to meet drainage requirements of the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD). For purposes of this article, the adequacy of a surface water management system shall be conclusively demonstrated upon the issuance of a SFWMD surface water construction permit, or if a project is exempted from SFWMD permits, equivalent approval under chapter 3. 
(4)  Solid waste disposal. Capacity of the disposal facility will be measured in pounds (or equivalent volume) and applied citywide. 
(5)  Parks and recreation. The quantity of parks will be measured in acres and applied to the total permanent and seasonal resident population in the city. 
(6)  Roads. Concurrency on all roads will be determined on a roadway segment-by-segment basis consistent with the level of service standards set forth in the comprehensive plan Policy CIE 1.1.3 except where the city council has designated constrained roads and created transportation concurrency management areas, transportation concurrency exception areas, or long-term transportation management systems. 
(f)  Determination of capacity of potable water, sanitary sewer or solid waste facilities. In determining the capacity of potable water, sanitary sewer or solid waste facilities, the city manager or designee must include the capacity of all facilities as they exist at the time the development permit will be issued, plus other facilities that are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380. The city manager or designee, in accordance with section 2-30(J), is also authorized to issue certificates of concurrency compliance subject to the condition that at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the necessary facilities must be in place and available to serve the new development. 
(g)  Determination of adequacy of surface water management system. In determining the adequacy of a surface water management system, the city manager or designee will rely upon the reviews performed by the city staff and/or designee and the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD). The adequacy of a surface water management system will be conclusively demonstrated upon the issuance of a surface water construction and operating permit by the SFWMD. 
(h)  Parks and recreation facilities. For parks and recreation facilities, the development must meet one of the following standards: 
(1)  At the time the development order or permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services must be in place or under actual construction; or 
(2)  A development order or permit is issued with a stipulation that, at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or its functional equivalent, the acreage for the necessary facilities and services to serve the new development is dedicated to or acquired by the local government; and 
(3)  The necessary facilities and services needed to serve the new development are scheduled to be in place or under actual construction not more than one year after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent as provided in the adopted city five-year schedule of capital improvements; 
(4)  At the time the development order or permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed agreement that requires the necessary facilities and services to serve the new development to be in place or under actual construction not more than one year after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent; or 
(5)  At the time the development order or permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement, pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or a development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380, to be in place or under actual construction not more than one year after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent. 
(i)  Determination of road facility capacity. In determining the capacity of a road facility, the city manager or designee will include existing roadways and committed improvements, as provided in the comprehensive plan. 
(j)  Issuance of finding upon failure to qualify for certificate of concurrency compliance. 
(1)  If a proposed development permit fails to qualify for a certificate of concurrency compliance under the criteria set forth in subsections (a) through (i) of this section, the city manager or designee, nevertheless, will issue a finding that the proposed development will meet concurrency requirements if it is subject to the condition that the facilities and services which will be necessary to serve the development will be in place when the impacts of the development occur, without degrading the level of service of these facilities below the minimum level prescribed in the comprehensive plan. When no solution can be identified to provide for the additional facility capacity required, the certificate will either be limited to reflect the then-available facility capacity, or the application denied. If the city manager or designee issues such a finding, to be known as a conditional certificate of concurrency compliance, no development permit may be issued unless it contains on its face the statement that the permit is issued subject to the condition that additional facilities to serve the development must be in place when the impacts of the development occur. 
(2)  The conditional certificate of concurrency compliance must identify the minimum additions to the then-existing facilities that must be built and operating, in addition to planned facilities meeting the criteria set forth in subsections (f) through (i) of this section, before further development permits will be issued. If a developer proposes to develop in stages or phases so that facilities and services needed for each phase will be available in accordance with the standards set forth in this article, the city manager or designee may issue a conditional certificate of concurrency compliance that establishes related periods of time when additional development permits will be granted if the additional facilities, identified by the city manager or designee as being the minimum additions to existing or planned facilities needed to serve each phase, are built and operating. 
(3)  Development permits issued based on conditional certificates of concurrency compliance must specify the next levels of permitting that may be granted before the condition of the permit must be satisfied. 
(4)  The city manager or designee may also issue a conditional certificate of concurrency compliance where the proposed development will meet concurrency requirements; provided certain documents, not submitted with the initial application, are subsequently delivered to the city manager or designee, or the proposed final development order is subject to the review of other agencies and therefore likely to change, thereby requiring further concurrency review. 
(k)  Validity of certificates of concurrency compliance and conditional certificates of concurrency compliance. Certificates of concurrency compliance and conditional certificates of concurrency compliance are valid for three years from the date they are issued or for the remaining tenure of the underlying final development order or development permit, whichever is less. 
(l)  Validity of development permits. 
(1)  Except for building permits, development permits which have been issued based upon a valid certificate of concurrency compliance or a conditional certificate of concurrency compliance will be valid for a period of three years from the date the certificate was granted or for the normal duration of the development permit, whichever is less. This will enable the developer to begin the work permitted or to apply for additional development permits not inconsistent with the permit issued, using the concurrency certificate from the issued permit to satisfy the concurrency review requirements for the additional permits. Approval by the city council of an extension to the term of a development permit, other than a building permit, will automatically constitute the issuance or extension, as the case may be, of a concurrency certificate for three years or the period of the extension, whichever is less. 
(2)  Building permits issued based upon a valid concurrency certificate will be valid for the normal duration of the building permit, so long as the permit is applied for while the certificate of concurrency compliance or conditional certificate of concurrency compliance is valid, the permit application is substantially complete, and the building permit is ultimately issued in the normal course. The original permit may not be extended more than twice without triggering new concurrency review. 
(3)  If a building permit for which such an application has been filed is not issued within six months of the expiration date of the applicable concurrency certificate, a rebuttable presumption will arise that the building permit has not been issued within the normal course, as that term is used in this subsection. 
(m)  The city manager's or designee's action not appealable pursuant to state law. The city manager's or designee's action in issuing a concurrency certificate is not a development order which can be appealed pursuant to F.S. § 163.3215. 
(n)  Requirements for activity affecting constrained roads. Concurrency compliance for land development activity affecting constrained roads will be determined in accordance with the comprehensive plan objective CIE 1.2 to the extent these policies provide additional restrictions that supplement other provisions of this article. The requirements of these policies are as follows: 
(1)  A maximum volume to capacity (v/c) ratio of 1.85 for all constrained roads. 
(2)  The city manager or designee may not issue permits that cause the maximum volume to capacity ratio to be exceeded or that affect the maximum volume to capacity ratio once exceeded. 
(3)  Once the maximum volume to capacity ratio is achieved, permits may only be issued where capacity enhancements and operational improvements have been identified and commitments to implement those improvements are made that will maintain the volume to capacity ratio on the constrained segment at or below 1.85. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-46), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-46), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-31. - Concurrent development orders. 
(a)  Final development orders and amendments or extensions thereto. A request or application for a final development order, an amendment to a final development order or an extension of a final development order may be accepted by the city manager or designee, or the city council, prior to the issuance of a valid concurrency certificate for the exact plan of development for which approval is sought. However, no final development order, final development order amendment or final development order extension may be granted for a development that will cause more intensive impacts than those assumed by the city manager or designee when issuing his concurrency certificate unless the development in question is resubmitted for review for compliance with the level of service requirements of the comprehensive plan. If an amendment to a final development order, already approved for concurrency purposes, results in a reduction of anticipated impacts on public facilities and services, the city manager or designee must approve the amendment unless to do so would be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Building permits and mobile home permits. The city manager or designee may not accept or approve an application for a building permit or mobile home move-on permit unless it is exempt from the requirements of this article set forth in section 2-30(b) or accompanied by a valid concurrency certificate issued specifically for the structure for which permit approval is sought. Building permits or mobile home move-on permits will not be granted for structures that will cause more intensive impacts than those assumed by the city manager or designee when issuing his concurrency certificate. 
(c)  Subdivision plats. An application for approval of a plat prepared in accordance with F.S. ch. 177 may be accepted by the city manager or designee, but may not be approved by the city council unless it is accompanied by a valid concurrency certificate issued specifically for the exact plan of development for which approval is sought. No plat may be approved for a development that would cause more intensive impacts than those assumed by the city manager or designee when issuing his concurrency certificate. 
(d)  Other development permits. No other development order may be issued by the city manager or designee, or by any other city official, for a development permit not included in subsections (a) through (c) of this section when the order would permit an impact on facilities and services for which level of service standards have been adopted in the comprehensive plan, unless the city manager or designee has first issued a valid concurrency certificate. 
(e)  Review of planned development rezoning applications. In addition to the mandatory provisions of this article, the city manager or designee is authorized, at the request of the applicant, to review planned development rezoning applications. In those cases where the city manager or designee has determined that an approval could lead to excessive impacts on public facilities and services needed to support the development, he may issue an advisory opinion setting forth the basis of his determination. Approvals of a development application subject to such an advisory opinion must contain conditions to mitigate the identified impacts. Those conditions may include reduction of density or intensity, phasing of the project to match its impacts with planned expansion of public facilities, required improvements to public facilities or other similar mitigating measures. 
(f)  Developments of regional impact. Application for final local development orders on property located within a development of regional impact are subject to the concurrency levels of service requirements of the comprehensive plan unless the DRI is vested pursuant to definitions found in chapter 9. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-47), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-47), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-32. - Vested rights. 
(a)  No person has a vested right, by virtue of a development order issued on or after November 25, 2002, to receive a subsequent development order where the development permitted by the subsequent order would have an impact on the public facilities and services listed in F.S. § 163.3180(1), and for which regulatory levels of service are established in the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Upon adoption of the comprehensive plan ("comp plan" or "plan"), all development and all actions taken in regard to development orders shall be consistent with the plan as adopted. All land development regulations enacted or amended after the effective date of the comprehensive plan shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan, except that the city council may, in its sole discretion, permit development with a greater density for projects that were submitted and under review prior to October 16, 2002, if such density was permitted under the Lee Plan and only if similar and compatible to the adjoining property. Land development regulations in existence as of the effective date of the comprehensive plan that are inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall be amended through the public hearing process to conform to the goals, objectives, and policies of the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the comprehensive plan, an application for a development approval may be approved if an applicant has demonstrated development rights that are vested under the standards of this section. Persons or entities whose interests are directly affected by the comprehensive plan have the right to request an administrative interpretation of the plan as it affects their specific interest. Applicants must seek administrative relief by first requesting the city to grant an administrative interpretation of the plan before they may file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  Such an interpretation, under the procedures and standards set forth below, shall thereafter be binding on the city and the person or entity, their heirs, assigns and any subsequent successors. Such administrative interpretations are intended to expedite and reduce disputes over plan interpretations, provide predictability in plan interpretations, resolve certain map or boundary disputes and avoid unnecessary litigation. Once rendered, an administrative interpretation may be challenged by the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in circuit court. 
(1)  Subject matter of administrative interpretations. Administrative interpretations shall be provided only as to the matters set forth below. In no event shall administrative interpretations hereunder involve questions of the consistency of development or land use regulations with the comprehensive plan. Administrative interpretations shall be limited to: 
a.  Whether the single-family residence provision as hereinafter defined applies and the applicant desires a written opinion for future use, or with a concurrent building permit application. 
b.  Whether an area has been (or should have been) designated as wetlands on the basis of a clear factual error. A field check shall be made prior to the issuance of such an interpretation. 
c.  Clarification of future land use map boundaries as to a specific parcel of property. 
d.  Conflicts between existing land development approvals and the comprehensive plan. F.S. § 163.3167(8) recognizes the vested status of development of regional impacts, or local development orders where the development has commenced and is developing in good faith. F.S. § 163.3164 defines a development order as any order which approves or conditionally approves an application for a development permit. A development permit includes any building permit, zoning permit, subdivision approval, rezoning certification, special exception, variance, or any other official action of local government having the effect of permitting the development of land. No application for administrative determination is required for developers of developments of regional impact that are developing in accordance with an approved development of regional impact development order or related development orders and permits, as they are deemed consistent with the comprehensive plan, except for vested rights determinations of buildings that exceed 75 feet in height. 
e.  Within 365 days from adoption of the comprehensive plan, any legal owner, or beneficial owner with the authorization of the legal owner, whose interest is directly affected by the comprehensive plan provisions, and owners and developers adversely affected by the comprehensive plan limitation on the height of buildings to 75 feet above flood elevation must apply for an administrative interpretation that their proposed structure is vested in accordance with the standards for administrative interpretations as set forth below. The duration for vesting of any structures under this provision is limited to the life of the development of regional impact development order or any local development order or development approval, or any extension thereto. An application for a determination of vested rights with respect to the 75 foot height limitation shall be filed on or before November 25, 2003, or the alleged vested right shall be deemed abandoned. Notwithstanding, all other vested rights applications may be filed at any time. 
(2)  Procedures for administrative interpretations. 
a.  Anyone seeking an administrative interpretation shall submit an application to the city. The city manager or designee will issue administrative interpretations for applications pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, except that the city attorney or designee shall issue administrative interpretations for: 
1.  Single-family provisions for future use or a concurrent building permit application; or 
2.  Vested rights determination of any existing land development approvals or limitations including vested rights to construct building that exceed 75 feet in height above flood elevation. 
b.  The application shall include all the information necessary to support the request. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the application is appropriate as to subsection (a) of this section, and that it meets the standards set forth in subsection (c) of this section. The city attorney or designee, or the city manager or designee, whichever is applicable, will review each application, and issue a written administrative interpretation, which may be appealed by the applicant to city council. 
(3)  Standards for administrative interpretations. In making the proposed determination, the city will consider, in furtherance of the guidelines contained in the comprehensive plan, the following criteria: 
a.  Wetland designations, and map boundaries. Is there a clear factual error or discrepancy? 
b.  Single-family residence provision. 
1.  Applicability . Notwithstanding any other provision of the comprehensive plan, any entity owning property or entering or participating in a contract for purchase agreement of property, which property is not in compliance with the density requirements of the comprehensive plan, shall be allowed to construct one single-family residence on said property; provided that: 
(i)  Date created . 
A.  The lot or parcel shall have been created and recorded in the official Plat Books of the county prior to the effective date of the original county Comprehensive Plan (December 21, 1984), and the configuration of said lot has not been altered; 
B.  A legal description of the lot or parcel was lawfully recorded in the Official Record books of the clerk of circuit court prior to December 21, 1984; or 
C.  The lot was lawfully created after December 21, 1984, and the lot area was created in compliance with the said comprehensive plan, as it existed at that time. 
(ii)  Minimum lot requirements . In addition to meeting the requirements set forth in subsection (d)(3)b.1(i) of this section, the lot or parcel shall: 
A.  Have a minimum of 4,000 square feet in area if it was created prior to June 27, 1962; 
B.  Have a width of not less than 50 feet and an area of not less than 5,000 square feet if part of a subdivision was recorded in the official Plat Books of the county after June 27, 1962, and prior to December 21, 1984; 
C.  Have a minimum of 7,500 square feet in area if it was created on or after June 27, 1962, and prior to December 21, 1984, if not part of a subdivision recorded in the official Plat Books of the county; 
D.  Have been in conformance with the zoning regulations in effect at the time the lot or parcel was recorded if it was created after December 21, 1984; or

The road must have, at a minimum, a graded surface of shell, marl, gravel base rock, or other compacted fill material, suitable for yearround use; or 
B.  The lot or parcel must be located within a subdivision that was approved under F.S. ch. 177, as long as the subdivision improvements have been made or security for their completion has been posted by the subdivider. 
If the lot or parcel cannot meet the requirement of access and drainage, this requirement shall not apply to the extent that it may result in an unconstitutional taking of land without due process. 
2.  Construction regulations . Subsequent to a property owner establishing the right to build a single-family residence on a lot through the procedures set forth in this plan, the following policies shall prevail: 
(i)  The residential structure shall be in compliance with all applicable health, safety, and welfare regulations, as those regulations exist at the time the application for construction of residence is submitted. 
(ii)  Lots or parcels which qualify for the right to construct a residence and which contain wetlands shall be subject to special provisions of the wetlands protection ordinance. 
(iii)  If two or more contiguous lots or parcels have each qualified for the right to build a single-family residence, the property owner is permitted and encouraged to reapportion properties if the result of the reappointment is a lot which comes closer to meeting the property development regulation standards for the zoning district in which it is located and as long as no property becomes nonconforming or increases in its nonconformity as a result of the reapportionment and as long as the density will not increase. 
(iv)  If a lot or parcel has qualified for the right to construct a single-family residence, nothing herein shall be interpreted as prohibiting the combining of said lot or parcel with other contiguous property; provided the density will not increase. 
(v)  If two or more contiguous properties have each qualified for the right to construct a single-family residence and if the lots or parcels are located in a zoning district which permits duplex or two-family dwellings, the property owners may combine the lots to build a single duplex or two-family building in lieu of constructing two single-family residences. 
(vi)  Transferability. This right shall run with the land and be available to any subsequent owner if the property that qualifies for the single-family provision is transferred in its entirety. 
c.  Vested rights clarification of any existing land development approvals or limitations to the height of buildings to 75 feet above flood elevation. 
1.  The vested rights determination shall be limited to rights acquired prior to adoption of the comprehensive plan or amendment thereto and shall vest only that development specifically and expressly contemplated by the valid official act of the city. The term "official act of the city" includes official acts of the city's predecessor, Lee County. The term "official act" includes, but is not limited to, the issuance of any development order or development permit as defined by F.S. § 163.3164. 
2.  The applicant shall have the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, to demonstrate that he meets the standards of subsection (3)(d)c.2(i) of this section, or in the alternative, meets the standards of subsection (3)(d)c.2(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section. 
(i)  There is an official act (as enumerated below) of the city or its predecessor, Lee County. Any one of the following may constitute an official act of the city or the county for purposes of the vested rights determination: 
A.  A building permit issued prior to the effective date of the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of filing of the vested rights application; 
B.  One or more development permits, as defined by F.S. § 163.3164, or approvals for development issued by the city or Lee County; or 
C.  A subdivision plat recorded in the official records of the county, which fulfills the criteria set forth in F.S. § 380.05(18), is an official act; 
(ii)  This particular applicant: 
A.  Relied upon the official act in good faith (for example, the applicant must not have had notice or knowledge of a pending change in zoning, allowable uses or density, etc., such as if notice of the change was published, or there are active and documented efforts to develop and approve the proposed change at the time the property was purchased or expenses were incurred); and 
B.  Had a reliance that was reasonable (for example, an act of purchasing the property, entering into contracts or incurring additional obligations after the transmitted comprehensive plan was or became effective does not constitute reasonable reliance); 
(iii)  This particular applicant incurred such substantial obligations and expenditures that it would be highly inequitable or unjust to require that the development conform with the comprehensive plan in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application; and 
(iv)  Development of the project for which the applicant seeks a vested rights determination has made a substantial change in position in good faith. 
d.  Where appropriate and necessary, administrative interpretations of wetland determinations and map boundary determinations shall be incorporated into the plan during the next amendment cycle. 
(4)  Limitations on vested rights determinations . 
a.  In furtherance of those guidelines listed in the comprehensive plan, a proposed vested rights determination shall also contain the following: 
1.  A finding that the applicant has met the burden of proof for the vested rights determination; 
2.  A clear statement to specify the applicant's vested development rights; 
3.  A clear statement to the applicant that construction, when commenced, must continue in good faith; and 
4.  A vested rights determination is limited to the life of the development of regional impact, or other local development order or development permit, or any extension thereto. 
b.  The vested rights determination shall be limited to rights acquired prior to adoption of the comprehensive plan. The vested rights determination shall vest only that development specifically and expressly permitted by the official act of the city council, the county or their staff. 
(5)  Appeals of administrative interpretations. 
a.  The following procedures shall apply in appealing administrative interpretations: 
1.  An administrative interpretation may be appealed to the city council by filing a written request within 15 days after receipt of the written administrative interpretation, which shall be sent to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
2.  The city council shall conduct a hearing to be held within 30 days after the date of receipt of a written request for an appeal. No additional evidence shall be considered by the city council, other than what is provided in the record. The council may adopt, overturn, or amend the administrative interpretation based on the standards set forth herein. The city council must render a written decision within 30 days of the hearing. 
3.  All appeals from the action of the city council shall be to circuit court. The appeal must be filed within 45 days after the written decision is rendered by the city council. 
b.  Prior to filing any claims under the Bert J. Harris, Jr., Private Property Rights Protection Act, an applicant must exhaust his administrative remedies under this administrative section before a cause of action or action of a governmental entity will accrue or be deemed ripe. Such exhaustion shall not include a filing of an appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari in circuit court.

Sec. 2-33. - Concurrency management information system. 
(a)  The city manager or designee will compile, publish and update, at least once each year, beginning no later than November 2, 2002, an inventory of the maximum, utilized and available capacity of public facilities for which minimum regulatory levels of service are prescribed in the comprehensive plan. This inventory must also contain a projection of future demand on the facilities due to anticipated growth and additions to capacity based upon construction in progress or under contract. The inventory must be reviewed and approved by the city council and, upon approval, will establish the availability and capacity of each facility to accommodate impacts from further development. This inventory will bind the city to the estimates of available capacity described in the inventory. Once approved by the council, these estimates will empower the city manager or designee to issue concurrency certificates for development permits requested where the estimates reasonably demonstrate sufficient infrastructure capacity will be available to serve all developments reasonably expected to occur during the period of time approved by the council. 
(b)  The city manager or designee will maintain a current cumulative list of all development orders issued by the city. The list will include the date of issuance of each development order. 
(c)  The city manager or designee will maintain a list of all certificates issued pursuant to this article, or a copy of each certificate in chronological order by date of issuance in lieu of a list. These records may be removed to storage once the most recent certificate on the list is six months old. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-50), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-50), 12-18-2013) 
State Law reference- Concurrency, F.S. § 163.3180. 
Sec. 2-34. - Variances. 
(a)  To provide for a reasonable economic use of land in those rare instances where a strict application of the concurrency requirements of this article would constitute an unconstitutional taking of property without due process of law, the city manager or designee may issue a concurrency variance certificate. This certificate may be issued only if the city manager or designee finds all of the following circumstances to be true: 
(1)  There are not sufficient facilities available to serve the development without violating the minimum concurrency requirements of this article; 
(2)  No reasonable economic use can be made of the property unless a development permit issued; 
(3)  No reasonable economic use can be made of the property by conditioning the development permit upon sufficient facilities becoming available, as provided for in this article; and 
(4)  The request to vary from the concurrency requirements of this article is the minimum variance that would allow any reasonable economic use of the property in question. 
(b)  The city manager or designee may require the applicant to substantiate the circumstances set forth in subsections (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section by submitting a report prepared by a professional appraiser. Upon verifying the existence of each of the circumstances set forth in subsections (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section, the city manager or designee may issue a concurrency variance certificate with the conditions he believes are reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare and give effect to the purpose of this article while allowing the minimum reasonable use necessary to meet constitutional requirements. If the city manager or designee has reason to question the truth of the circumstances as set forth in the appraiser's report, the city manager or designee may hire an independent professional appraiser to verify whether reasonable economic use can be made of the property without the issuance of the permit requested by the applicant. Where the reports of the individual appraisers are inconsistent, the city council will decide which appraiser's report will establish the minimum reasonable use of the property. 
(c)  Development orders that are issued based upon a concurrency variance certificate shall be consistent with, and incorporate all of the conditions placed on the certificate. 
(d)  Concurrency variance certificates are valid for the lesser of three years from the date of issuance or the normal duration of the development permit. 
(e)  Except for building permits, development permits which have been issued based upon a valid concurrency variance certificate shall be valid for the period of three years from the date when the permit is granted or the normal duration of the development permit, whichever is less, thereby enabling the developer to begin the work permitted or to apply for additional development permits not inconsistent with the permit issued, using the concurrency certificate from the issued permit to satisfy the concurrency review requirements for such additional permits. Building permits issued based upon a valid concurrency variance certificate are valid for the normal duration of the building permit; however, the original permit may not be extended more than twice without triggering new concurrency review. 
(f)  The city manager or designee's action in issuing a concurrency variance certificate is not a development order that can be appealed pursuant to F.S. § 163.3125. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-51), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-51), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-35. - Appeals. 
    Except for challenges to development orders controlled by the provisions of F.S. § 163.3215, any decision made by the city manager or designee in the course of administering this article may be appealed in accordance with those procedures set forth in chapter 4 for appeals of administrative decisions. In cases of challenges to development orders controlled by F.S. § 163.3215, no suit may be brought and no verified complaint, as explained in F.S. § 163.3215(4), may be filed or accepted for filing until the development order giving rise to the complaint has become final by virtue of its having been issued by the city manager or designee or by virtue of its having been ordered by the city hearing examiner on an appeal reversing the city manager or designee denial of the development permit, or by the city council in cases where the city has granted planned development zoning or an extension of a development order. Once a development order has been granted, the provisions of F.S. § 163.3215 will be the sole means of challenging the approval or denial of a development order, as that term is defined in F.S. § 163.3164(6), when the approval of the development order is alleged to be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. Action brought pursuant to F.S. § 163.3215 will be limited exclusively to the issue of comprehensive plan consistency.

Sec. 2-36. - Revocation of concurrency certificates. 
    The city manager or designee may revoke a concurrency certificate for cause where a certificate has been issued based on substantially inaccurate information supplied by the applicant, or where revocation of the certificate is essential to the health, safety or welfare of the public. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-53), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-53), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-37. - Nonliability of the city manager or designee. 
    The city manager or designee will not be held personally liable for incorrect decisions in administering this article. The city will, at its cost, defend the city manager or designee in any action involving such decisions and will indemnify the city manager or designee for any personal judgments that may be rendered against him. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-54), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-54), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-38. - Furnishing false information. 
    Knowingly furnishing false information to the city manager or designee, or any city official, on matters relating to the administration of this article will be punishable in accordance with section 1-5.

    The city council has the authority to adopt this article pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1(f), of the Constitution of the State and F.S. §§ 166.021, 163.3220(5) and 163.3223. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-91), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-91), 12-18-2013)

    This article applies to the corporate boundaries of the city. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-92), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-92), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-67. - Intent of article. 
    This article is intended to enable the city to invoke the provisions of the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act while retaining all of the home rule authority given it pursuant to Article VIII of the Constitution of the State and F.S. chs. 163, 166, and 380, to enter into other similar agreements beyond the provisions of the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act, and to establish specific notice and hearing procedures when it makes certain such similar agreements pursuant to its home rule authority. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-93), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-93), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-68. - Purpose of article. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to invoke the authority recognized in the city by the state in F.S. § 163.3223, to enter into development agreements with any and all persons having legal or equitable interests in real property located in the incorporated area of the city pursuant to the provisions of the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act. Vendees under a specifically enforceable contract for the sale of real property shall be recognized as having a sufficient equitable interest so as to have legal capacity to become a party to a development agreement made pursuant to the Florida Local Development Agreement Act, but persons having only a mere option to purchase real property shall not be so recognized. 
(b)  It is also the purpose of this article to establish notice and hearing procedures similar to those set forth in the Florida Local Development Agreement Act when the city makes agreements pursuant to its home rule authority in those types of agreements which are defined in this article as home rule development agreements. Development agreements made pursuant to this article, whether they are home rule development agreements as defined in this article or agreements made pursuant to the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act, are intended to protect and further the public health, safety and welfare by providing certain guarantees to land developers in exchange for their agreement to provide specified public facilities or services which are related to and consistent with the city's capital improvement planning and financing. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-94), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-94), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-69. - Definitions. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Development agreement means either a home rule development agreement or a statutory development agreement. 
    Home rule development agreement means an agreement made by the county pursuant to its home rule powers, and not pursuant to the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act, but only in those cases where development, as defined in F.S. § 163.3221(3), is to be undertaken by a person who is not a local government, as defined in F.S. § 163.3221(9), or an agency of the state or the United States of America. Moreover, the term "home rule development agreements" specifically does not mean agreements made between the county and other parties where the purpose of the agreement is exclusively to provide or pay for the construction, improvement, maintenance or other alteration of land or personally by third parties where the property in question is owned or is to be owned by the county or some other governmental agency. 
    Statutory development agreement means any agreement made specifically pursuant to the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act. All other terms that are used in any statutory development agreement made by the city pursuant to the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act, as such Act may be amended from time to time, shall be defined as set forth in F.S. § 163.3221, unless otherwise specifically defined in a particular statutory development agreement. 
(b)  Terms not so defined in this section shall be given their ordinary and customary meanings. 
(Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-95), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-70. - Applications for development agreements. 
    No person shall have the right to apply for or receive development agreement approval. Development agreements shall be considered by the city council only upon the recommendation of the city manager or designee, who may submit a proposed development agreement, in written form, for consideration by the council pursuant to the public hearing requirements of F.S. § 163.3225. Each such proposed development agreement so submitted shall include the city manager's or designee's recommendation as to whether the council should become or decline to become a party to the agreement, or a modified form of the agreement, with such information as the city manager or designee deems necessary to support his recommendation. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-96), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-96), 12-18-2013)

    Statutory development agreements shall include, at a minimum, all of the items enumerated in F.S. § 163.3227, plus such conditions, terms, restrictions or other requirements which the parties to the agreement may desire to include and which are not otherwise prohibited by law or which exceed the authority of the parties. If a statutory development agreement provides that any public facilities are to be designed or constructed by the developer, then the agreement shall require that the design and construction be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, county, and city standards and requirements, including, but not to be limited to, guarantees of performance and quality and project controls, including scheduling, quality and quality assurance. When public facilities are to be designed or constructed by the developer, or when the developer agrees to dedicate land to the city, the statutory development agreement shall specifically state the extent to which such design or construction or dedication shall be eligible for impact fee credits pursuant to such impact fee ordinances as the city may have in effect at the time when the statutory development agreement is to become effective. Statutory development agreements also shall incorporate the administrative appeal process set forth in section 2-76.

Sec. 2-72. - Notices and hearings. 
    No statutory development agreement shall be made pursuant to this article unless and until all of the requirements of F.S. § 163.3225 relating to the agreement have been satisfied. If a statutory development agreement is intended to rezone property, grant variances or accomplish any other approval which otherwise would be controlled by chapter 4, the notices required in chapter 4 also shall be given. The same notice and hearing requirements also should be observed when making home rule development agreements. However, failure to satisfy all of such notice and hearing requirements shall not be grounds to invalidate a home rule development agreement.

Sec. 2-74. - Reservation of home rule authority. 
    Nothing contained in this article shall be construed so as to prevent the city from entering into an agreement which is substantially similar to a development agreement adopted pursuant to the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act but which is based upon the home rule authority granted the city pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1(f), of the Constitution of the State and F.S. chs. 163, 166 and 380, and specifically recognized by the state legislature in F.S. § 163.3220(5).

Sec. 2-75. - Conflicts between development agreement and other land development regulations. 
    To the extent that this Code may permit it and a development agreement purports to rezone land, grant deviations or variances from this Code, including article II of this chapter, grant preliminary development orders or final development orders or amendments to or extensions thereof equivalent to those which are available pursuant to chapter 3, implement development orders or amendments to development orders for developments of regional impact, or grant building permits or other permits which specifically allow the physical alteration or improvement of land, the development agreement must explicitly identify each instance of conflict with other ordinances and expressly provide for the development agreement to control, or else all of the provisions of such other ordinances shall control to the extent that the development agreement fails to expressly provide otherwise. Any ambiguity with respect to whether a development agreement or an ordinance is to control shall be interpreted to favor the ordinance adopted prior to the development agreement. For any ordinance adopted after a development agreement, the conflict will be resolved pursuant to F.S. § 163.3233. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-101), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-101), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-76. - Appeals. 
    No person may challenge the validity of a development agreement on the grounds that the agreement conflicts with the city's comprehensive plan except pursuant to the procedures set forth in F.S. § 163.3215. A party or a successor in interest to a party to a development agreement may bring suit to challenge the city's administration of a development agreement only after he has exhausted the administrative remedies prescribed in chapter 4 for appeals from administrative actions.

    Director means the administrative director of the department charged with the planning and administration of development services for the city. 
    Land use plan map means the map adopted by city council, which delineates land use categories of the comprehensive plan. 
    Maximum total density means the maximum dwelling units per gross residential acre as indicated in the Table for Maximum Density in Policy 1.1.2 of the Bonita Plan. 
    Owner means the person with legal or equitable title to real property. 
    Planned development means those zoning districts designated in chapter 4 as PUD, RPD, MHPD, RVPD, CFPD, IPD, CPD, or MUPD. 
    Receiver parcel means a parcel of land on which a development right is used. 
    Sending parcel means a parcel of land from which a development right has been severed in accordance with this article. 
    Sever means the removal or separation of some specified right or use from the bundle of rights possessed by an owner of real property.

    Wetlands means a land use category as defined by the comprehensive plan. For the purpose of this article, lands which otherwise would meet this definition but for the effects of unlawful clearing of vegetation or filling or excavation will be included in this definition, and all lands which meet these criteria will be considered wetlands regardless of whether they are explicitly identified as such on the Bonita Plan land use map. 
(Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-143), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-99. - Administration of article. 
    The city manager or designee is responsible for the administration and enforcement of this article. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-144), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-144), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-100. - Conflicting provisions.

Sec. 2-101. - Concept, definition and establishment of development rights. 
(a)  Legal concept. The transfer of development rights idea is based upon the property law concept that the right to develop real estate is one of the bundle of rights included in fee simple ownership of land. Fee simple ownership of real estate allows the owner to sell, lease or trade any one or more, or all of the bundle of rights to their property. This bundle includes the right to use, lease, sell, or abandon the property or any of its components of ownership when not retained by a previous owner such as mineral, oil, gas, air, or development rights. All rights of ownership are subject to the limitation and legislative powers of the local government. 
(b)  Development rights defined. A development right is an appurtenant right of landownership. When lawfully established, a development right has an economic value separate from the land itself. It can be subject to reasonable regulation by local government under its police powers. The development right can be transferred by the owner to another property, through gift or sale. The landowner may sell the development rights and still retain the title to the land and the right to use the surface of the land on a limited basis. 
(c)  Establishment of development rights. 
(1)  For the purposes of this article, the owner of any vacant or undeveloped parcel of land or portion of a parcel designated wetlands by the comprehensive plan may transfer the development rights allocated to the parcel of land to any person at any time, subject to the provisions of subsection (c)(2) of this section. 
(2)  Development rights may only be transferred to those parcels or portions of parcels designated as receiving parcels. The maximum number of development rights that may be transferred to the receiver parcel must be determined in accordance with the following: Development in freshwater wetlands located in residential land use categories shall be limited to very low density residential uses and uses of a recreational, open space, or conservation nature that are compatible with wetland functions. The maximum density in freshwater wetlands, identified on the Map of Evaluated Wetlands in the Future Land Use Map Series, shall be one unit per 20 acres, except: 
a.  One single-family residence will be permitted on lots meeting the single-family residence provision contained in the administrative section of the Future Land Use Element; and 
b.  Transfer of density provision. Owners of identified freshwater wetlands may transfer densities to contiguous uplands under common ownership at the standard underlying density permitted for the uplands; provided that the resulting upland density does not exceed that shown in the following schedule and the area receiving the density transfer will be, thereafter, compatible with existing or planned development on adjacent lands and not negatively impact sensitive upland habitats and species.

Sec. 2-102. - Transfer of development rights limitations. 
(a)  Development rights authorized and severed by another governmental unit may not be used in the city unless both governments recognize the TDR through an interlocal agreement identifying the receiving and sending parcels. 
(b)  The city may limit the number of TDR units that can be transferred to the receiver parcel to an intensity lower than the amount requested by the developer if, during the zoning or development review process, the city determines that the receiver parcel for development reflects unique or unusual circumstances or is surrounded by uses such that a development of the parcel at an increased density or at a density bonus would be contrary to the public health, safety and welfare, and inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. The city council or the city manager or designee must, as part of any development order issued limiting the use of TDR units to less than the amount requested by the property owner or developer, include specific findings of fact to support the limitation and specify what changes, if any, would make the parcel proposed for development eligible for additional development rights. 
(c)  Areas defined as wetlands that are approved as part of any development order for open space or water management purposes are not eligible to sever or receive TDR units. 
(d)  The barrier or coastal islands, including, but not limited to, Lovers Key, Big Hickory Island, Little Hickory Island, and Bonita Beach, are not eligible to receive TDR units. 
(e)  Agreements for reciprocal transfers of TDR units from or to the city may be utilized for contiguous properties within both jurisdictions.

(2)  If the funds in the five-year CIP are insufficient to fully fund the construction of the improvement, the city may enter into a proportionate fair share agreement with the developer authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair share amount is calculated if the proportionate fair share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the city council, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system; provided that improvements are adopted into the five-year CIP no later than the next regular capital improvements update of the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Any transportation capital improvement proposed to meet the developer's proportionate fair share obligation must meet the design standards of the city for city-maintained roads and the design standards of the applicable governmental entity for all other roads. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-195), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 06-17; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-195), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-138. - Application process. 
(a)  A developer who shall commence any land development activity generating traffic which results in a failure of a road segment to achieve transportation concurrency may apply to the city for a proportionate fair share agreement. 
(b)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair share agreement, a preapplication meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options and other relevant issues. If the road segment that has failed to achieve transportation concurrency is on the Strategic Intermodal System, the state department of transportation shall be requested to participate in the preapplication meeting. 
(c)  Procedures for review of application for proportionate fair share agreement. 
(1)  The developer shall submit an application to the city manager or designee that includes a non-refundable application fee determined by the schedule on file in the city clerk's office and the following: 
a.  Name, address and contact information of the developer. 
b.  A drawing and legal description of the land. 
c.  Phasing schedule. 
d.  Description of the requested fair share mitigation. 
e.  If the requested fair share mitigation involves a road segment on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS), evidence of concurrence from the state department of transportation. 
f.  Traffic study performed by a licensed traffic professional, recognized as a professional engineer (PE) or planner (AICP) demonstrating failure of road segment to achieve transportation concurrency. 
(2)  Within 20 days of receipt of the application, the city manager or designee shall review the application to determine if the application is complete. If it is determined that the application is not complete, the city manager or designee shall send a written statement to the developer delineating the deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the developer within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned. The city manager or designee, in his sole discretion, may grant an extension to cure such deficiencies; provided the developer has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(3)  Once the city manager or designee determines the application is complete, he shall provide written notification of such to the developer and forward the application to the city attorney who shall, within 30 days, draft a proportionate fair share agreement for consideration by the city council at a meeting no later than 60 days from the date at which the developer received the notification that the application was complete. 
(4)  No proportionate fair share agreement shall be effective until approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-196), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-196), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-139. - Determination of proportionate fair share obligation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair share mitigation includes, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land and contribution of transportation facilities. 
(b)  The methodology used to calculate a developer's proportionate fair share obligation shall be as provided for pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(12), and as represented by the following formula: 
Where: 
Development trips = Those trips from the development that are assigned to roadway segment. 
SV increase = Service volume increase provided by the improvement to roadway segment. 
Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement. 
(c)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair share obligations, improvement costs shall be based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIP, the Lee County MPO Transportation Improvement Program, or the Florida Department of Transportation Work Program. Where such information is not available, the improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
(1)  An analysis by the city manager or designee of costs, adjusted by the Florida Department of Transportation Price Trends Index (or equivalent data) from the previous year, by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects; or 
(2)  The most recent issue of Florida Department of Transportation "Transportation Costs," as adjusted based upon the type of cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage, and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. 
(d)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the developer, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(e)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the city property appraiser or, at the mutual agreement of the city and the developer, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The developer shall supply a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the developer is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair share obligation for that development, then the developer must also pay the difference. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-197), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-197), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-140. - Transportation facilities impact fee credit. 
(a)  Proportionate fair share mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair share contribution is calculated. Additionally, if the proportionate fair share contribution is based on only a portion of the development's traffic, the credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees on which the proportionate fair share contribution is based. 
(b)  At the time the proportionate fair share obligation is being determined, the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact fee obligation for the proposed development. If the developer's proportionate fair share obligation is less than the development's anticipated total transportation facilities impact fee, then the developer must pay the difference to the city. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-198), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-198), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-141. - Proportionate fair share agreements. 
(a)  Should the developer fail to apply for a building permit within one year of the date of execution of the proportionate fair share agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Payment of the proportionate fair share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted more than one year from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to section 2-139, and adjusted accordingly. 
(c)  Developer improvements authorized under this article involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements on receipt of a warranty bond. The form of the warranty bond shall be approved by the city attorney. 
(d)  Developer improvements authorized under this article not involving dedications to the city must be completed upon recording of a final plat or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever event first occurs. 
(e)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order will be subject to additional proportionate fair share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic. 
(f)  A developer may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee to the city will be nonrefundable. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-199), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-199), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-142. - Appropriation of fair share revenues. 
(a)  All proportionate fair share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIP, or for use as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate full share agreement. 
(b)  In the event a scheduled transportation facility improvement is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction shall be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the general requirements of section 2-137(b)(2), as determined by the city council. 
(c)  The city may enter into an interlocal agreement with one or more adjacent governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts or a joint participation agreement with the state department of transportation to address cross jurisdictional impacts, so as to require that any developer proportionate fair share agreement remitted to the city accounts for impacted regional facilities projected to be operating below the level of standard service caused by the traffic from the proposed development.

Notes: 
(1)  Mobile homes not located within an established mobile home park will be treated as a single-family residence for impact fee calculation purposes. Senior adult housing, detached will be treated as a single-family residence for impact fee calculation purposes. 
(2)  Timeshare will be treated as multi-family. Senior adult housing, attached, will be treated as multi-family for impact fee calculation purposes. 
(3)  Impact fees for a golf course (i.e., tees, fairways, greens, accessory structures such as golf cart houses, etc.) are due and payable prior to the issuance of the development order for the golf course. The golf course club house and related club house facilities will not be included in the impact fee calculation for the golf course. Impact fees for the club house and related facilities will be calculated separately, at the time of building permit issuance for these facilities, based upon the uses encompassed by the club house facility. 
(4)  Under this article, impact fees become due and payable at the time of building permit issuance. Mine impact fees become due and payable at the time the mine operation permit is issued. Mine impact fees will not be assessed upon the renewal of an existing mine operation permit, provided the mine footprint remains the same. If the mine footprint is increased beyond the previous mine operation permit approval, impact fees will be assessed upon the incremental increase in cubic yardage at the time the mine operation permit is issued. For purposes of this Code, a building permit or mine operation permit is considered "issued" when the permit meets all of the following criteria: 
a.  The permit is approved by the city; 
b.  Has been picked up by the owner or his agent; and 
c.  All applicable fees have been paid. 
[Also, NOTE: The development order process is separate and distinct from the building permit process and not relevant with respect to establishing when impact fees become due and payable, except as to golf courses and RV parks.] 
(5)  If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed uses, as defined in section 2-291, then the fee will determined according to the schedule set out in this subsection by apportioning the total space within the building according to the space devoted to each principal use. A shopping center will be considered a principal use; however, when located within a shopping center, a drive-through restaurant or convenience store with gasoline sales will be considered a principal use. 
(b)  When change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use requires the issuance of a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order, the roads impact fee will be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. However, no impact fee refund or credit will be granted if a net decrease results. 
(1)  If the road impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it will be recalculated and the difference refunded to the original feepayer or collected by the county or city, whichever is applicable. If road impact fees are owed, no city or county permits of any type may be issued for the building or structure in question, or for any other portion of a development of which the building or structure in question is a part, until impact fees are paid. The building official may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees. 
(2)  The fee schedule set forth above will go into effect on Monday, November 5, 2018. The fee schedule in effect prior to this ordinance will remain in effect until close of business, Friday, November 2, 2018. Notwithstanding, any reductions in fee calculations shall be implemented by staff upon the effective date of this ordinance. 
(3)  The rate for the fee schedule set forth above is hereby discounted for the first three years of imposition by the following amount: 
Discount Amount Commencement Date Expiration Date 30% November 5, 2018 November 1, 2019 20% November 4, 2019 November 6, 2020 10% November 9, 2020 November 5, 2021  
Unless amended by city council, the full fee schedule will go into effect on Monday, November 8, 2021. The last discounted rate will remain in effect until close of business, Friday, November 5, 2021. 
(c)  If a feepayer opts not to have the impact fee determined according to subsection (a) of this section, then the feepayer must prepare and submit to the city manager or designee an independent fee calculation study for the land development activity for which a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order is sought. The independent fee calculation study must measure the impact of the development in question on the road system illustrated on Figure 1 of the transportation element of the comprehensive plan by following the prescribed methodologies and formats for the study established by the city administrative code. The feepayer must attend a preapplication meeting with the city manager or designee to discuss the traffic engineering and economic documentation required to substantiate the request. The traffic engineering and economic documentation submitted must address all aspects of the impact fee formula that the city manager or designee determines to be relevant in defining the project's impacts at the preapplication meeting and must show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Traffic engineering studies. 
a.  Documentation of trip generation rates appropriate for the proposed land development activity; 
b.  Documentation of trip length appropriate for the proposed land development activity; and 
c.  Documentation of the percent of new trip data appropriate for the proposed land development activity. 
(2)  Cost documentation studies. The feepayer may also provide documentation substantiating that the costs to accommodate the impacts of the proposed development, or the revenue credits due to the development, differ from the average figures used in developing the fee schedule. This documentation must be prepared and presented by qualified professionals in their respective fields and must follow best professional practices and methodologies. The following formula must be used by the city manager or designee to determine the roads impact fee per unit of development: 
IMPACT FEE = VMT × NET COST/VMT 
Where: 
VMT = ADT × % NEW × LENGTH ÷ 2 
ADT = Trip ends during average weekday 
% NEW = Percent of trips that are primary, as opposed to pass-by or diverted-link trips 
LENGTH = Average length of a trip on the approved road system 
÷ 2 = Avoids double-counting trips for origin and destination 
NET COST/VMT = COSTNMT ? CREDIT/VMT 
COST/VMT = COST/LANE-MILE ÷ AVG LANE CAPACITY 
COST/LANE-MILE = Average cost to add a new lane to the approved roadway system 
AVG LANE CAPACITY = Average daily capacity of a lane at level of service "D" 
CREDIT/VMT = $/GAL ÷ MPG × 365 × NPV 
$/GAL = Capacity-expanding funding for roads per gallon of gasoline consumed 
MPG = Miles per gallon, average for U.S. motor vehicle fleet 
365 = Days per year (used to convert daily VMT to annual VMT) 
NPV = Net present value factor (i.e., 12.46 for 20 years at five percent discount) 
(d)  All buildings, structures and facilities capable of being used by the public will be charged the full roads impact fee set forth for that use in the impact fee schedule. However, the city recognizes that there are instances where a building, structure or facility capable of public use is actually restricted to the private use of a specific development (i.e., private clubhouse dining facilities built as a planned development amenity). In these instances, a reduced impact fee may be claimed by the property owner in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Filing of an independent fee calculation study ultimately approved by the city; or 
(2)  Acceptance by the developers and property owner, as a condition of the building permit or development order approval, that: 
a.  The developer or owner will submit documentation, acceptable to the division of development services, that shows the proposed private use will have no off-site road impacts; 
b.  The proposed use will be restricted to the sole use of the residents of the subdivision by covenants acceptable to the city attorney or designee and enforced by a property owner's association or similar entity; 
c.  The certificate of occupancy will be revoked if the city manager or designee determines the proposed private use has changed in character to that of a public use and the certificate of occupancy may not be reinstated until the full impact fee is paid; and 
d.  The city will withhold all building permits and development approvals for all phases or parts of the development connected with, or entitled to use, the proposed private facility until the full impact fee is paid. 
(e)  The impact fee schedule referenced in this division will be administratively reviewed and reanalyzed every three years. As a result of this review, city staff is authorized and directed to pursue amendments to the impact fee schedule supported by the review and reanalysis. In accordance with this section, the first review of the roads impact fee schedule must be completed and any amendments to the schedule presented to the city council for adoption no later than September 1, 2021. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-266), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 05-12, § 1, 7-20-2005; Ord. No. 07-14, § 1, 9-5-2007; Ord. No. 10-06, § 1, 7-7-2010; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-266), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-10, § 1, 7-18-2018 ) 
Sec. 2-194. - Payment. 
(a)  The feepayer must pay the roads impact fees required by this division to the building official prior to the issuance of any building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order for which the fee is imposed, except as otherwise provided in this division. No building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order may be issued by the city, until the impact fee has been paid, except as provided in this division. 
(b)  The city is entitled to charge the applicant of a permit or development order for which roads impact fees are payable under this division, an administrative fee equal to up to three percent of the road impact fees it collects. The administrative fee must be used to offset the costs in administering this division. The administrative fee must be paid in cash. 
(c)  In lieu of cash, the road impact fee may be paid with credits created in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(d)  All funds collected pursuant to this division will be properly identified by roads impact fee benefit district and promptly transferred for deposit into the appropriate roads impact fee trust fund to be held in separate accounts as determined in section 2-196 and used solely for the purposes specified in this division. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-267), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 08-21; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-267), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-195. - Benefit districts established. 
    The corporate limits of the city shall constitute the roads impact fee benefit district. Subdistricts may be created by further legislation or by interlocal agreement. For the purposes of the county benefit districts, the city constitutes a subdistrict. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-268), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-268), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-196. - Trust fund-accounts. 
(a)  There is established a roads impact fee trust fund-accounts for the city. Subsidiary accounts may be established for subdistricts created by the city council or by interlocal agreement. 
(b)  Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-269), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-269), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-197. - Use of funds. 
(a)  Funds collected from roads impact fees must be used for the purpose of capital improvements to approved roads. Such improvements must be of the type made necessary by the new development. Funds may not be used for periodic or routine maintenance as defined in F.S. § 334.03(15) and (20). Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, impact fee collections, including any interest earned thereon, less administrative costs retained, must be used exclusively for capital improvements within the roads impact fee district from which funds were collected, or for projects in other roads impact fee districts that are of direct benefit to the roads impact fee district from which the funds were collected. These impact fee funds must be segregated from other funds and expended as provided in the appropriate ordinance or administrative code. Funds may be used or pledged in the course of bonding or other lawful financing techniques, so long as the proceeds raised thereby are used for the purpose of capital improvements to approved roads. If these funds or pledge of funds are combined with other revenue sources in a dual or multipurpose bond issue or other revenue-raising device, the proceeds raised thereby must be divided and segregated, so the amount of the proceeds reserved for road purposes bears the same ratio to the total funds collected that the roads impact fee funds used or pledged bear to the total funds used or pledged. 
(b)  Each fiscal period the city manager or designee will present to the city council a proposed capital improvement program for roads, assigning funds, including any accrued interest, from the several roads impact fee trust funds to specific road improvement projects. Money, including any accrued interest, not assigned in any fiscal period must be retained in the same roads impact fee trust funds until the next fiscal period, except as provided by the refund provisions of this division. 
(c)  Unless prohibited by an appropriate interlocal agreement, money placed in one roads impact fee trust fund may be borrowed and placed in another roads impact fee trust fund if the city council first determines in a public meeting that the loan will not disrupt or otherwise alter the timing of provision of capital facilities to the lending district and will be repaid from specifically identified revenue sources within two years, either from the borrowing district or subdistrict or from some other source, with interest at a rate established by the council at the time it authorizes the loan; provided, however, that, if the interest is to be paid from roads impact fees collected in the borrowing district, the council first finds that the amount of the interest to be paid will be equal to or less than the benefit given to feepayers in the borrowing district or subdistrict by virtue of the earlier provision of capital facilities in the borrowing district or subdistrict made possible by virtue of the loan. To secure repayment of the loan on the terms established for it by the council, the motion authorizing the loan implicitly must include direction and authorization to the city's fiscal officers to perform all acts necessary to comply with the loan terms. Loans may not be renewed. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-270), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-270), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-198. - Refund of fees paid. 
(a)  If a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order expires, is revoked or voluntarily surrendered, and therefore voided, and no construction or improvement of land, including moving a mobile home onto land, has commenced, then the feepayer is entitled to a refund of the roads impact fee paid as a condition for its issuance, except that three percent of the fee paid will be retained as an administrative fee to offset the cost of processing the refund. Subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the feepayer is entitled to a refund of the roads impact fee paid excluding the administrative fee. No interest will be paid to the feepayer on refunds due to non-commencement. 
(b)  If a permit or development order expires, then a refund of the roads impact fee is allowed, if no construction has commenced, to the extent the fee was paid in cash, that is, a noncredit payment. However, the three percent administrative fee described in subsection (a) of this section will be deducted from the amount eligible for refund prior to the issuance of the roads impact fee refund. 
(c)  Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten years from the date the roads impact fee was paid will, upon application of the feepayer within 180 days of that date, be returned to the feepayer with interest at the rate of three percent per annum. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-271), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-271), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-10, § 1, 7-18-2018 )

(2)  No interior completion permit will be issued until the applicant pays the corresponding road impact fee that is due, or demonstrates to the building official that the road impact fee due has already been paid for the units to be completed. 
(b)  Deferrals must be claimed by the feepayer at the time of the application for a commercial or residential building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order. Any deferrals not so claimed are deemed waived by the feepayer. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-273), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-273), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-201. - Exemptions. 
(a)  The following are exempt from payment of the roads impact fee: 
(1)  Alterations or expansion of an existing building or use of land where no additional living units will be produced, where the use is not changed, and where the alteration or expansion will not produce more vehicular trips than the existing use. 
(2)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures that will not produce more vehicular trips than those produced by the principal building or use of the land. 
(3)  The replacement of an existing lawfully permitted building, mobile home, park trailer or structure, provided that no additional vehicular trips will be produced than those produced by the original use of the land. 
(4)  Building permits that were issued for commercial buildings and residential dwelling units, which have been reinstated by the building official in accordance with the Florida Building Code are exempt from the payment of impact fee increases that occurred after issuance of the original permit. However, no impact fee refund or credit will be granted if a net decrease results. 
(5)  An amendment to a recreational vehicle development order; provided that the amendment does not increase the number of recreational vehicle units permitted. 
(6)  A building permit obtained by or for the United States of America, the state, or the Lee County School Board. 
(7)  A building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order for which the roads impact fee thereof has been or will be paid or provided for pursuant to a written agreement, zoning approval or development order which, by the written terms thereof, clearly and unequivocally was intended to provide for the full mitigation of the projected impact. 
(8)  A building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order that does not generate or attract additional traffic. 
(9)  Building permits issued in a council-approved or recognized redevelopment area or enterprise zone, or low or moderate income housing development, but only when the permit is identified by the type of land use and by the land area or housing or redevelopment program in question by explicit language included in an appropriate development order.

(10)  Building permits that obtain a banked impact fee credit from the city. The city hereby grants to itself the authority to bank impact fee credits as a result of any public improvement project occurring on or after April 15, 2000, within the city's boundary.

City council, by resolution, may use the banked impact fee credit for a city-operated affordable housing or economic development program, or may grant nonprofit corporations who are building affordable housing credits specified by amount and type, if available in the city's impact fee bank. 
(b)  Exemptions must be claimed by the feepayer at the time of the application for a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order. Any exemptions not so claimed are deemed waived by the feepayer. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-274), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 01-17; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-274), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-10, § 1, 7-18-2018 ) 
Sec. 2-202. - Credits. 
(a)  Credits are subject to the following: 
(1)  Prohibition. No credit will be given for: 
a.  Site-related improvements. 
b.  Local roads. 
c.  Access streets needed to achieve site location standards for commercial development or for internal circulation unless required by the city pursuant to criteria in chapter 3. 
(2)  Capital improvement to approved roads. All capital improvements for approved roads, except for those improvements deemed site-related pursuant to a development or zoning approval, may generate roads impact fee credits in amounts to be established pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section or by an appropriate interlocal agreement. The right to determine whether a capital improvement will be approved for credit purposes lies exclusively with the city, unless otherwise provided for in an appropriate interlocal agreement. If the improvement is not site-related and is required under a development or zoning approval, credits will be given to the extent required by law. 
(3)  Conditions of credit approval. Credit for road construction or land dedication is subject to the following: 
a.  Road construction. 
1.  A request submitted for road impact fee construction credits must include a detailed project description and complete cost estimates, prepared by qualified professionals, sufficient to enable the city manager or designee to verify the cost estimates and determine the appropriate credit amount. The city manager or designee retains the right to secure other engineering and construction cost estimates meeting the fee methodology set forth in this division to determine independently the credit amount to recommend or approve. 
(i)  Class 1 roads. The city manager or designee may approve roads impact fee credits for construction costs applicable to Class 1 roads. This includes roads required to be constructed pursuant to a zoning condition or development order approval. Construction credits for Class 1 roads will be given for the full actual cost of construction, as determined and verified by the city manager or designee. 
(ii)  Class 2 or 3 roads. In the case of Class 2 and 3 roads, the city manager or designee will make a recommendation to the city council on the appropriate amount of credits. Construction credits for Class 2 and 3 roads may be given at the discretion of the city council on a case-by-case basis if the council finds that: 
A.  The construction will not increase public infrastructure costs to serve the new development; and 
B.  The grant of credits will not significantly affect future roads impact fee collections within the roads impact fee benefit district in which the credit is created. 
2.  The amount of credit approved by the council is limited to the actual verified costs of construction and may be reduced by the percentage that the new road's total capacity is expected to be utilized by local traffic from future development on adjacent lands owned or controlled by the grantor. This amount may be further reduced, at the council's discretion, to reflect the public works estimate of the value of the accelerated construction of the road in relation to the city's schedule of planned road construction. 
b.  Land dedication. 
1.  The following documents must be submitted to support an application for road impact fee credits applicable to land dedication for approved roads: 
(i)  A signed and sealed ALTA survey prepared by a licensed professional surveyor and mapper and certified to the city, encompassing the land to be dedicated to the city and covered by the title insurance policy; 
(ii)  A specimen of the deed that will be used to convey the title to the appropriate governmental body; 
(iii)  An ALTA Form B title insurance policy in an amount equal to the approved value of the credits, to be issued by a company satisfactory to the city attorney or designee and verifying that the proffered deed will convey unencumbered fee simple title to the appropriate governmental body; 
(iv)  Property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals that appraise the road as part of the whole development of regional impact, planned development or parent parcel; and 
(v)  A document from the tax collector stating the current status of the property taxes. 
(vi)  An affidavit of interest in real property in accord with F.S. § 286.23. The affidavit must certify to Bonita Springs the name and address of every person having a beneficial interest in the real property, however small or minimal. The disclosure affidavit must specifically identify the property to be conveyed and be sworn before a notary. 
These submittals will be reviewed by the city manager or designee in making the decision to approve credits or to make a recommendation to the city council. 
2.  Except where a dedication is made pursuant to a condition of zoning approval or development of regional impact development order, the appraiser must value the land at its current zoning without any enhanced value that could be attributed to improvements on the parent parcel. If the land in question is subject to a valid agreement, zoning approval or development order prescribing a different valuation, that document will control the date of valuation. If the dedication is made pursuant to a condition of zoning or other development approval and is not a site-related improvement and the condition does not specifically prescribe otherwise, then the land value will be based upon the value of the land as it existed prior to the approval containing the condition of dedication. The city manager or designee retains the right to determine independently the amount of credit to be approved or recommended by securing other property appraisals for right-of-way dedications using the methodology described in this division. 
3.  Credit for dedication of right-of-way will be limited to the minimum amount of right-of-way needed by county department of transportation or the city. Credit for Class 1 and 2 roads will be given for the full value of the land in question, as determined by the methodology and procedures set out in this subsection. Credit for dedication of right-of-way for Class 3 roads may be given by the city council on a case-by-case basis if the council finds that: 
(i)  The dedication will not increase public infrastructure costs to serve the new development; and 
(ii)  The granting of credits will not significantly affect future roads impact fee collections within the roads impact fee benefit district in which the credit is created. 
4.  The amount of credit approved by the city council is limited to the value of the land, as determined by the methodology and procedures set out in this subsection, and may be reduced by the percentage the capacity of the road is reasonably expected to be utilized by local traffic from future development on adjacent lands owned or controlled by the grantor. This amount may be further reduced, at the city council's discretion, to reflect the city council's estimate of the value of the accelerated acquisition of the road in relation to the county's or city's schedule of planned road construction. In every case, roads impact fee credits must be calculated consistent with F.S. § 380.06(5). 
c.  Impact fee credit application requirement waiver. The city manager or designee may waive one or more of the impact fee credit application requirements if the requirement is clearly not necessary to protect a city interest. A waiver granted by the city manager or designee must be in writing, and addressed to the applicant. 
(4)  Timing of credit issuance. Credits for construction will be created when the construction is complete and accepted by the city for maintenance in accordance with AC 06-03 (Resolution 06-149) or when the feepayer posts security for the costs of such construction. Credits for land dedication will be created when the title to the land has been accepted by the city and recorded in the official records of the clerk of circuit court. No credits for construction or dedication will be approved or created until the city has established the location of the road using the procedures provided by law. Security in the form of cash, a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow agreement must be posted with the city council, made payable to the county in an amount approved by the city manager or designee equal to 110 percent of the full cost of construction. If the road construction project will not be constructed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by the city, the amount of the security will be increased by ten percent, compounded for each year of the life of the security. The security must be reviewed and approved by the city attorney or designee prior to acceptance by the city. If the proposal is to dedicate the road to the county, the city may assign its rights in such security to the county if permitted by law. 
(5)  Transferability. Roads impact fee credits are transferable. Transferable credits may be sold, assigned or conveyed as set forth in the administrative code. Credits may be used to pay or offset roads impact fees in the same roads impact fee district in which they are earned, or in other districts directly benefited by the capital improvements for which the credits were granted, and consistent with any interlocal agreements made with the county or a participating municipality. Credits may not be used outside the district earned unless the proposed use is found to be in compliance with this division by the city attorney or designee and the city manager or designee. Unless a longer period is specifically authorized by the city council, transferable credits must be used within ten years of the date created. The creation date is the date the instruments conveying legal title to the land or improvements given in exchange for credits were recorded in the city's official record book. The creation date for credits pursuant to prepayment of fees will be the date the prepayment is received by the city. If roads impact fees are increased before credits are used, the unused transferable credits will be increased at the time they are used in the same percentage that the fee is increased for the particular listed use, rounded to the nearest dollar. Credits not used within ten years of issue will be canceled by the building official unless extended by city council. Any person who accepts credits in exchange for the dedication of land or improvements does so subject to the limitations on the use, duration, non-refund provisions and other restrictions prescribed in this division. 
(6)  Use of credits. Roads impact fee credits must be used, on a first applied for, full credit basis. This rule applies to permits requested on any part of the original tract. For purposes of this section, the term "original tract" means the area developed or approved for development, as part of a dedication of land or improvements for which the credits were created, to the extent that credits are available. This will be done regardless of whether the feepayer owned the land at the time the credit was created, and regardless of whether the ratio of the credit requested to the original full credit created is disproportionate to the ratio of the land covered by the requested permit to the original tract. In addition, this rule will apply regardless of whether the owner of the original tract has assigned or failed to assign the credits to the current owner of the land covered by the requested permit. 
(7)  Withdrawal. Any person who offers land or improvements in exchange for credits may withdraw the offer prior to the transfer of legal title to the land or improvements and pay the impact fees required by this division. 
(b)  Feepayers claiming credits must submit documentation sufficient to permit the building official to determine whether the credits claimed are due and, if so, the amount of the credits. 
(c)  Credits must be claimed by the feepayer at the time of the application for a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order. Any credits not so claimed will be deemed waived by the feepayer. 
(d)  Once used, credits must be canceled and may not be reestablished even if the permit for which they were used expires without construction. 
(e)  Any person seeking credits for dedication of land must meet with the city attorney or designee and city manager or designee to seek agreement on appraisal methodology and assumptions before preparing any appraisals for valuation of land to be dedicated. 
(f)  Reciprocity with the county . Credits issued by the county will be recognized by the city if: 
(1)  The credits are issued for improvements that would qualify under this division. 
(2)  The county has adopted a reciprocal regulation providing for similar recognition of the city road impact fee credits or has entered into an agreement with the city allowing reciprocal transfer of impact fee credits.

Sec. 2-204. - Enforcement of division; penalty; furnishing false information. 
    A violation of this division is punishable according to section 1-5; however, in addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the city, or any parks impact feepayer, has the power to sue for relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this division. Knowingly furnishing false information to the city manager or designee, the building official or any municipal official who is charged with the administration of this division on any matter relating to the administration of this division will constitute a violation.

(Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-304), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 2-236. - Imposition. 
(a)  Except as provided in sections 2-243 through 2-245, any person who, after September 16, 1985, seeks to develop land by applying to the city for the issuance of a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order to make an improvement to land for one of the uses specified in section 2-237 will be required to pay a parks impact fee as set forth in LDC section 2-237.

If the structure, mobile home or park trailer so moved is replaced by an equivalent use, no parks impact fee will be owed for the replacement use. In every case, the burden of proving past payment of parks impact fees or equivalency of use rests with the feepayer. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-305), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-305), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 2-237. - Computation of amount. 
(a)  At the option of the feepayer, the amount of the parks impact fee may be determined by the schedule below. The reference in the schedule to recreational vehicles refers to the number of recreational vehicle sites which are permitted by the applicable final development order. 
Land Use Type Unit Parks Impact Fee per Unit Single-family residence Dwelling unit $912.00 Multiple-family building, duplex, two-family attached or townhouse Dwelling unit $690.00 Mobile home not in mobile home park Dwelling unit $912.00 Mobile home in MH Park Per Pad $668.00 RV park site Per Pad $668.00 Hotel/motel room Room $436.00 Timeshare Dwelling $690.00  
(b)  The fee schedule set forth above will go into effect on August 15, 2018. The fee schedule in effect prior to this ordinance will remain in effect until close of business, Tuesday, August 14, 2018 when the new fees take effect. When change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use requires the issuance of a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order, the parks impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. However, should the change of use, redevelopment or modification result in a net decrease, no refunds or credits for past impact fees paid shall be made or created. 
(c)  If the parks impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated and the difference refunded to the original feepayer or paid, whichever is applicable. If parks impact fees are owed, no permits of any type may be issued for the building or structure in question, or for any other part of a development of which the building or structure in question is a part, while the fees remain unpaid, and the building official may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees. 
(d)  The person applying for the issuance of a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order may, at his option, submit evidence to the city manager or designee indicating that the fees set out in subsection (a) of this section are not applicable to the particular development. Based upon convincing and competent evidence, which shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the city administrative code, the city manager or designee may adjust the fee to that appropriate for the particular development. The adjustment may include a credit for private recreational facilities provided to the development by the feepayer if the private recreational facilities serve the same purposes and functions as set forth in the comprehensive plan for parks. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-306), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-306), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 2-238. - Payment. 
(a)  The feepayer must pay the parks impact fee required by this division to the building official prior to the issuance of the building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order for which the fee is imposed. No building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order may be issued for development listed in section 2-237(a) by the city until the impact fee has been paid. 
(b)  The city is entitled to charge the applicant of a permit or development order for which parks impact fees are payable under this division, an administrative fee equal to up to three percent of the parks impact fees it collects. The administrative fee must be used to offset the costs in administering this division. The administrative fee must be paid in cash. 
(c)  In lieu of cash, the parks impact fee may be paid by the use of credits created in accordance with the provisions of sections 2-243 and 2-245. 
(d)  All funds collected pursuant to this division must be promptly transferred for deposit into the parks impact fee trust fund and used solely for the purposes specified in this division. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-307), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 08-21; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-307), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-239. - Benefit district established. 
    For purposes of this division, there is hereby established a single parks impact fee benefit district. Subdistricts may be created by further legislation or by interlocal agreement. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-308), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-308), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 2-240. - Trust fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a parks impact fee trust fund. Subsidiary accounts may be established for subdistricts. 
(b)  Funds withdrawn from this account must be used in accordance with the provisions of section 2-241. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-309), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-309), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-241. - Use of funds. 
(a)  Funds collected from parks impact fees will be used for the purpose of capital improvements for parks. Parks impact fee collections, including any interest earned thereon, less administrative costs retained pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, will be used exclusively for capital improvements or expansion within the city. These impact fee funds will be segregated from other funds and will be expended in the order in which they are collected. Funds may be used or pledged in the course of bonding or other lawful financing techniques, so long as the proceeds raised thereby are used for the purpose of capital improvements for parks. If these funds or pledge of funds are combined with other revenue sources in a dual or multipurpose bond issue or other revenue-raising device, the proceeds raised thereby will be divided and segregated in such a fashion that the amount of such proceeds reserved for park purposes bears the same ratio to the total funds collected that the parks impact fee funds used or pledged bear to the total funds used or pledged. 
(b)  Each fiscal period the city manager will present to the city council a proposed capital improvement program for parks, assigning funds, including any accrued interest, from the parks impact fee trust fund to specific park projects. Monies, including any accrued interest, not assigned in any fiscal period will be retained in the parks impact fee trust fund until the next fiscal period, except as provided by the refund provisions of this division. 
(c)  The city collecting parks impact fees is entitled to retain up to three percent of the parks impact fees it collects in cash, or by a combination of cash and credits, as an administrative fee to offset the costs of administering this division. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-310), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-310), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-242. - Refund of fees paid. 
(a)  If a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order expires, is revoked or is voluntarily surrendered, and is therefore voided, and no construction or improvement of land, including moving a mobile home onto land, has been commenced, then the feepayer shall be entitled to a refund of the parks impact fee paid as a condition for its issuance, except that three percent of the fee paid shall be retained as an administrative fee to offset the cost of processing the refund. Subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the feepayer shall be entitled to a refund of the parks impact fee paid excluding the administrative fee. No interest shall be paid to the feepayer on refunds due to non-commencement. 
(b)  No refund shall be allowed for any expired permit or development order which was obtained with the use of credits, except for that portion of the parks impact fee which was not paid by credit, in which case the administrative fee described in subsection (a) of this section shall be deducted from the portion of the fee which was not paid by credit. 
(c)  Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following six years from the date the parks impact fee was paid shall, upon application of the feepayer within 180 days of that date, be returned to the feepayer with interest at the rate of three percent per annum. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-311), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-311), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 2-243. - Prepayment of fees. 
    If required or specifically permitted by the terms of a development order adopted pursuant to F.S. ch. 380, or by an agreement made by the city pursuant to its home rule powers granted in Article VIII of the Constitution of the State and F.S. § 166.021, or by a development agreement made pursuant to F.S. §§ 163.3220-163.3243, the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act, and any ordinance adopted under the enabling authority thereof, any person who desires to prepay parks impact fees may do so by delivering a certified check or cashier's check to the building official with a letter identifying the amount of parks impact fees prepaid. The city will issue credit equal to the prepayment subject to the express terms of the development order, agreement or development agreement. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-312), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-312), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-244. - Exemptions. 
(a)  The following are exempted from payment of the parks impact fee: 
(1)  Alteration or expansion of an existing building or use of land, where no additional living units will be produced and where the use is not changed. 
(2)  The construction of accessory buildings or structures that will not produce additional living units. 
(3)  The replacement of an existing lawfully permitted building, mobile home, park trailer or structure, provided that no additional vehicular trips will be produced than those produced by the original use of the land 
(4)  Building permits that were issued for commercial buildings and residential dwelling units, which have been reinstated by the building official in accordance with the Florida Building Code are exempt from the payment of impact fee increases that occurred after issuance of the original permit. However, no impact fee refund or credit will be granted if a net decrease results. 
(5)  An amendment to a recreational vehicle development order; provided the amendment does not increase the number of recreational vehicle units permitted. 
(6)  A building permit obtained by or for the United States of America, the state or the county school board. 
(7)  A building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order for which the parks impact thereof has been or will be paid or provided for pursuant to a written agreement, zoning approval or development order which, by the written terms thereof, clearly and unequivocally was intended to provide for the full mitigation of the projected impact. 
(8)  A building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order that does not result in an additional living unit. 
(9)  Building permits that obtain a banked impact fee credit from the city. The city hereby grants to itself the authority to bank impact fee credits as a result of any public improvement project occurring on or after April 15, 2000, within the city's boundary. The city may bank credits when buildings, mobile homes, park trailers or structures are physically removed but not replaced in the same location. The city council, by resolution, may use the banked impact fee credit for a city-operated economic development or affordable housing program, or may grant nonprofit corporations who are building affordable housing credits specified by amount and type, if available in the city's impact fee bank. 
(b)  Exemptions must be claimed by the feepayer at the time of the application for a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order. Any exemptions not so claimed will be deemed waived by the feepayer. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-313), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-313), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 2-245. - Credits. 
(a)  Credits are subject to the following: 
(1)  Prohibition. No credit will be given for private recreational facilities, except pursuant to an independent fee calculation prepared and accepted in accordance with section 2-237(d). 
(2)  Capital improvement to park facilities. All other capital improvements for approved parks may generate park impact fee credits in amounts to be established pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section or by an appropriate interlocal agreement. The right to determine whether a capital improvement will be approved for credit purposes lies exclusively with the city, unless otherwise provided for in an appropriate interlocal agreement, or unless the improvement is required under a participating municipality, state, county or city development or zoning approval, in which case credits will be given to the extent required by law. The city will issue park impact fee credits for the value of critical occupied habitat in accordance with section 3-456(e)(3) when the size of habitat preserved on a given project exceeds the open space requirements of chapter 3. 
(3)  Conditions of credit approval. Credit for park capital improvement construction or land dedication is subject to the following: 
a.  Capital improvement construction. When a person requests credit for construction of an approved park facility, he must submit a project description in sufficient detail and with complete cost estimates prepared by qualified professionals so as to enable the city manager or designee to verify the cost estimates and thereby determine the appropriate amount of credit to recommend to the city council. 
b.  Land dedication. 
1.  When a person requests credit for land dedication for approved park facilities, he must present the following: 
(i)  A survey of the land to be dedicated, certified by a professional land surveyor or registered land surveyor, each of whom are licensed in this state; 
(ii)  A specimen of the deed which he proposes to use to convey title to the appropriate governmental body; 
(iii)  An ALTA Form B title insurance policy in the amount equal to the approved value of the credits. The policy must be issued by a company satisfactory to the city attorney or designee and verify that the proper deed will convey unencumbered fee simple title to the appropriate governmental body; 
(iv)  Property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals that appraise the land as part of the whole development of impact, planned development, or parent parcel; and 
(v)  A certified copy of the most recent assessment of the property for tax purposes. 
(vi)  An affidavit of interest in real property in accord with F.S. § 286.23. The affidavit must certify to Bonita Springs the name and address of every person having a beneficial interest in the real property, however small or minimal. The disclosure affidavit must specifically identify the property to be conveyed and be sworn before a notary. 
These submittals will be reviewed by the city manager or designee in making the decision to recommend credits to the city council. 
2.  Except where a dedication is made pursuant to a condition of zoning approval or development of impact development order, the appraiser must value the land at its current zoning without any enhanced value that could be attributed to improvements on the parent parcel. If the land in question is subject to a valid agreement, zoning approval, or development order that prescribes a different valuation, that document will control the date of valuation. If the dedication is made pursuant to a condition of zoning or other development approval and is not a site-related improvement and the condition does not specifically prescribe otherwise, the land will be valued based on the value of the land as it existed prior to the approval that contains the condition of dedication. The city manager or designee retains the right to independently determine the amount of credit to be recommended by securing other property appraisals for those improvements or land dedications. In every case, parks impact fee credits will be calculated so as to be consistent with F.S. § 380.06(5). 
(4)  Timing of credit issuance. Credits for construction will be created when the construction is complete and accepted by the appropriate governmental body for maintenance or when the feepayer posts security for the costs of the construction. Credits for land dedication will be created when the title to the land has been accepted by the appropriate governmental body and recorded in the official records of the clerk of circuit court. Security in the form of cash, a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit or escrow agreement must be posted with the city council, made payable to the city in an amount approved by the city manager or designee equal to 110 percent of the full cost of construction. If the park construction project will not be completed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by the city, the amount of the security will be increased by ten percent, compounded for each year of the life of the security. The security must be reviewed and approved by the city attorney or designee prior to acceptance by the city. If the park will be owned by a participating municipality, the city may assign its right in the security to the municipality if permitted by law. 
(5)  Transferability. Parks impact fee credits are transferable. Transferable credits may be sold, assigned or conveyed as set forth in the city administrative code. Credits may be used to pay or offset parks impact fees required by this division. Unless a longer period is specifically authorized by the city council, transferable credits must be used within six years of the date created. The creation date is the date the instruments conveying legal title to the land or improvements given in exchange for credits were recorded in the city's official record book. The creation date for credits pursuant to prepayment of fees under section 2-238 will be the date the prepayment is received by the city. If park impact fees are increased before the credits are used, the unused transferable credits will be increased at the time they are used in the same percentage that the fee prescribed in section 2-237 for the particular listed use, rounded to the nearest dollar. Credits not used within six years of issue will be canceled by the building official. Any person who accepts credit in exchange for the dedication of land or improvements does so subject to the limitations on the use, duration, non-refund provisions and other restrictions prescribed in this division. 
(6)  Use of credits. Unless converted to transferable form pursuant to subsection (a)(7) of this section, park impact fee credits must be used on a first applied for, full credit basis. This rule applies to permits requested on any part of the original tract. For purposes of this section, the term "original tract" means the area developed or approved for development, as part of a dedication of land or improvements for which the credits were created, to the extent that credits are available. This will be done regardless of whether the feepayer owns the land at the time the credit was created, and regardless of whether the ratio of the credit requested to the original full credit created is disproportionate to the ratio of the land covered by the requested permit to the original tract. In addition, this rule will apply regardless of whether the owner of the original tract has assigned or failed to assign the credits to the current owner of the land covered by the requested permit. The burden of proving ownership or agency lies exclusively on the person claiming it. 
(7)  Withdrawal. Any person who offers land or improvements in exchange for credits may withdraw the offer prior to the transfer of legal title to the land or improvements and pay the impact fees required by this division. 
(b)  Feepayers claiming credits must submit documentation sufficient to permit the building official to determine whether the credits claimed are due and, if so, the amount of credits. 
(c)  Credits must be claimed by the feepayer at the time of the application for a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order. Any credits not so claimed will be deemed waived by the feepayer. 
(d)  Once used, credits will be canceled and may not be reestablished even if the permit for which they were used expires without construction. 
(e)  Any person seeking credits for dedication of land must meet with the city attorney or designee, division of planning and construction, and city lands staff to seek agreement on appraisal methodology and assumptions before preparing appraisals for valuation of land to be dedicated.

Sec. 2-247. - Enforcement of division; penalty; furnishing false information. 
    A violation of this division is punishable according to section 1-5; however, in addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the city, or any parks impact feepayer, has the power to sue for relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this division. Knowingly furnishing false information to the city manager or designee, the building official or any municipal official who is charged with the administration of this division on any matter relating to the administration of this division will constitute a violation thereof.

Sec. 2-314. - Imposition. 
(a)  Except as provided in sections 2-321 through 2-324, any person who, on or after December 31, 1999, seeks to develop land by applying to the city for the issuance of a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order to make an improvement to land for one of the uses specified in section 2-315 will be required to pay a fire impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this division.

Sec. 2-315. - Computation of amount-EMS and fire. 
    So as to provide uniformity in the amount to be collected, the city will collect EMS and fire impact fees as established by the county in its Land Development Code for the specific fee based on the specific land use and fee per unit. In establishing the fees, the county will base their ordinance using the applicable impact fee study. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-386), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 06-02, 3-1-2006; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-386), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-316. - Payment.

Sec. 2-317. - Benefit districts established. 
    There are hereby established fire impact fee benefit districts for the fire control and rescue district service area and the Estero Fire Rescue District service area. EMS fees will be transmitted to the county in accordance with the impact fee benefit district established in their Land Development Code. In the event the city or fire district boundaries change, the fire impact fee district for that service area will be deemed changed based upon the effective date of that change, and the city will proceed to collect in accordance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-388), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-388), 12-18-2013)

These impact fee funds must be segregated from other kinds and expended in the order in which they are collected. Funds may be used or pledged in the course of bonding or other lawful financing techniques, so long as the proceeds raised thereby are used for the purpose of land acquisition and capital improvements to and expansion within or for the benefit of the fire impact fee benefit district from which the funds were used or pledged. If these funds or pledge of funds are combined with other revenue sources in a dual or multipurpose bond issue or other revenue-raising device, then the proceeds raised thereby must be divided and segregated in a manner that will cause the amount of the proceeds reserved for the benefit of the participating fire impact fee benefit district to bear the same ratio to the total funds collected as the amount of the participating fire impact fee benefit district funds used or pledged bears to the total funds used or pledged. 
(b)  Monies placed in the fire impact fee trust fund may not be borrowed. 
(c)  The city collecting fire impact fees is entitled to charge and collect an amount equal to up to three percent of the impact fees it collects in cash, or by a combination of cash and credits, as an administrative fee to offset the costs of administering this division. This administrative charge is in addition to the impact fee amount required by this division and is not required to be used for purposes of capital improvements. The applicant is responsible for payment of the administrative charge in conjunction with the payment of impact fees at the time a building permit or development order is issued.

(a)  If a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order expires, is revoked, voluntarily surrendered, or otherwise becomes void, and no construction or improvement of land, including moving a mobile home onto land, has been commenced, then the feepayer is entitled to a refund of the fire impact fees paid as a condition for its issuance, except that up to three percent of the impact fees paid will be retained as an administrative fee to offset the costs of processing the refund. This administrative fee is in addition to the administrative charge collected at the time of fee payment. No interest will be paid to the feepayer on refunds due to non-commencement. 
(b)  Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following six years from the date the fire impact fees were paid will, upon application of the feepayer within 180 days of that date, be returned to the feepayer with interest at the rate of six percent per annum.

City council, by resolution, may use the banked impact fee credit for a city operated economic development or affordable housing program, or may grant nonprofit corporations who are building affordable housing credits specified by amount and type, if available in the city's impact fee bank. Any new development upon a site for which credits were banked under this provision will be subject to future impact fees. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-394), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-394), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-324. - Credits. 
(a)  Credits are subject to the following: 
(1)  Capital improvement to fire protection services. All other capital improvements for fire protection services may generate fire impact fee credits in amounts to be established pursuant to section 2-315. The right to determine whether a capital improvement will be accepted for credit purposes lies exclusively with the entity providing the service; however, the right to determine whether the value of the capital improvement will be approved for credit purposes lies exclusively with the city, unless otherwise provided in an appropriate interlocal agreement. 
(2)  Conditions of credit approval. Credit for fire protection equipment or facility construction or land dedication is subject to the following: 
a.  Fire equipment or facility construction. When a person requests credits for purchase or construction of fire equipment or facilities, he must submit a project description in sufficient detail and with complete cost estimates prepared by qualified professionals so as to enable the city manager or designee and fire chief to verify the cost estimates and thereby determine the appropriate amount of the credit and determine the acceptability for credit. That person must also submit written acknowledgement from the entity which will acquire the equipment or facility that the entity intends to accept the equipment or facility. 
b.  Land dedication. 
1.  When a person requests credit for land dedication, he must present the following documents to the city manager or designee and fire chief: 
(i)  A survey of the land to be dedicated, certified by a professional surveyor and mapper registered and licensed in the state; 
(ii)  A specimen of the deed he proposes to use to convey title to the appropriate governmental body; 
(iii)  An ALTA Form B title insurance policy in an amount equal to the approved value of the credits. This policy must be issued by a company satisfactory to the city attorney or designee and verify that the proffered deed will convey unencumbered fee simple title to the appropriate governmental body; 
(iv)  Property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals that appraise the land as part of the whole development of regional impact, planned development or parent parcel; and 
(v)  A certified copy of the most recent assessment of the property for tax purposes. 
These submittals will be reviewed by the city manager or designee in making the decision to approve credits. 
2.  Except where a dedication is made pursuant to a condition of zoning approval or development of regional impact development order, the appraiser must value the land at its current zoning without any enhanced value that could be attributed to improvements on the parent parcel. If the land in question is subject to a valid agreement, zoning approval or development order that prescribes a different valuation, that document will control the date of valuation. If the dedication is made pursuant to a condition of zoning or other development approval and is not a site-related improvement and the condition does not specifically prescribe otherwise, the land will be valued based upon the value of the land as it existed prior to the approval that contains the condition of dedication. The city manager or designee retains the right to independently determine the amount of credit to be recommended by securing other property appraisals for those improvements or land dedications. In every case, fire impact fee credits must be calculated so as to be consistent with F.S. § 380.06(16). 
(3)  Timing of credit issuance. Credits for construction will be created when the construction is complete and accepted by the appropriate governmental body for maintenance or when the feepayer posts security for the costs of the construction. Credits for land dedication will be created when the title to the land has been accepted by the appropriate governmental body and recorded in the official records of the clerk of circuit court. Security in the form of cash, a performance bond, an irrevocable letter of credit or escrow agreement must be posted with the city council, made payable to the city in an amount approved by the city manager or designee equal to 110 percent of the full cost of construction. If the construction project will not be completed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by the city, the amount of the security will be increased by ten percent, compounded for each year of the life of the security. The security must be reviewed and approval by the city attorney or designee prior to acceptance by the city. If the improvement is to be owned by the fire district, the city may assign its rights in the security to the fire district if permitted by law. 
(4)  Transferability. Fire impact fees are transferable. Transferable credits may be sold, assigned or conveyed as set forth in the city administrative code. Credits may be used to pay or offset the fire impact fees in the same fire impact fee district in which they are earned, consistent with the interlocal agreements made with the fire district. Unless a longer period is specifically authorized by the city council, transferable credits must be used within six years of the date created. The creation date is the date the instrument conveying legal title to the land or improvements given in exchange for credits was recorded in the city's official record books. If fire impact fees are increased before credits are used, the unused transferable credits will be increased at the same time they are used in the same percentage that the fee prescribed in section 2-315 for the particular listed use, rounded to the nearest dollar. For example, see Exhibit A of Ordinance No. 90-14, on file with the county clerk of court. Credits not used within six years of issue will be canceled by the building official. Any person who accepts credits in exchange for the dedication of land or improvements does so subject to the limitations on the use, duration, non-refund provisions and other restrictions prescribed in this division. 
(5)  Use of credits. Unless converted to transferable form pursuant to subsection (a)(6) of this section, fire impact fee credits created prior to October 1, 1989, must be used, on a first applied for, full credit basis. This rule applies to permits requested on any part of the original tract. For purposes of this section, the term "original tract" means the area developed or approved for development, as part of a dedication of land or improvements for which the credits were created, to the extent that credits are available. This will be done regardless of whether the feepayer owns the land at the time the credit was created, and regardless of whether the ratio of the credit requested to the original full credit created is disproportionate to the ratio of the land covered by the requested permit to the original tract. In addition, this rule will apply regardless of whether the owner of the original tract has assigned or failed to assign the credits to the current owner of the land covered by the requested comment. In determining ownership or agency for purposes of administering pre-October 1, 1989, credits, the building official may rely upon apparent authority, but he may, in his sole discretion, require proof of ownership or agency. The burden of proving ownership or agency lies exclusively on the person claiming it. 
(6)  Conversion of credits. Credits created prior to October 1, 1989, may be converted to transferable form unless conversion is prohibited by the conditions of a development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380 or some other participating municipality, state, or county government, city development approval. The conversion must be accomplished by an agreement between the city and all owners of the undeveloped land remaining from the original tract of land that was developed or permitted for development as part of the dedication of land or improvements for which the credits were created. The agreements must state that the person who acquires transferable credits will defend and indemnify the city from claims made by other persons asserting an interest in the pre-October 1, 1989, credits. 
(7)  Withdrawal. Any person who offers land or improvements in exchange for credits may withdraw the offer prior to the transfer of legal title to the land or improvements and may pay the impact fees required by this division. 
(b)  Feepayers claiming credits must submit documentation sufficient to permit the building official to determine the credits claimed are due and, if so, the amount of credits. 
(c)  Credits must be claimed by the feepayer at the time of the application for a building permit, mobile home move-on permit or recreational vehicle development order. Credits not so claimed will be deemed waived by the feepayer. 
(d)  Once used, credits must be canceled and may not be reestablished even if the permit for which they are used expires without construction. 
(e)  Any person seeking credits for dedication of land must meet with the city attorney or designee and city lands staff to seek agreement on appraisal methodology and assumptions before preparing any appraisals for valuation of land to be dedicated.

Sec. 2-325. - Appeals. 
    Any decision made by the city manager or designee, or by the building official, in the course of administering this division may be appealed in accordance with those procedures set forth in chapter 4 for appeals of administrative decisions. So as to provide continuity in the administration of this division, every interlocal agreement made pursuant to this division must specifically incorporate this appeal procedure, and the fire district agrees to be bound by the results of the administrative appeal. These interlocal agreements will provide further that if the administrative appeal decision is further appealed to the circuit court by another person, the appeal will be defended by the city, at its expense, unless the district elects to provide the defense of the case.

ARTICLE X. - HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS 

Sec. 2-466. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to address the impacts created by residential development on hurricane shelter availability and evacuation capability in the city. These regulations are intended to mitigate the growing hurricane shelter deficit, along with related effects on evacuation times and infrastructure, caused by permitting residential development without addressing the incremental impact on the city's hurricane preparedness program. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-461), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-461), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-467. - Applicability. 
    This article applies only to development required to obtain a development order under chapter 3 and is applicable to all new residential development within the city that is located in a landfalling Category 1, 2, or 3 storm surge area. This article also applies to new and existing developments of regional impact. The provisions of this article supersede the County Administrative Code Section 7-9 in the event of a conflict. Under this article, residential development includes, but is not limited to, all assisted living facilities, dwelling units, living and housing units, mobile homes, recreational vehicle developments (including recreational vehicles qualifying as permanent residences under this Code), hotel and motel, health care facilities Groups II, IV, V and social services facilities Groups IV and V, as these terms are defined in chapter 4. This article does not eliminate the shelter requirements applicable to mobile home or recreational vehicle developments contained in section 3-265 to the extent this obligation is fulfilled by compliance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-462), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-462), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 17-03 , § 1, 2-1-2017) 
Sec. 2-468. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Coastal high hazard area means that area of the hurricane vulnerability zone defined as the land falling Category 1 storm surge zone as delineated by the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council. 
    Division means the county division of public safety. 
    Hurricane evacuation routes means the routes designated by the division that have been identified with standardized statewide directional signs, or are identified on the regional hurricane evacuation study for the movement of persons to safety in the event of a hurricane. 
    Hurricane shelter space means, at minimum, an area of 20 square feet per person located within a hurricane shelter. 
    Hurricane vulnerability zone means the areas delineated by a regional hurricane evacuation study as requiring evacuation in the event of a land falling Category 3 hurricane event. 
    Primary public hurricane shelter means a structure designated by the division as a place for shelter during a hurricane event. Only those structures located outside of the coastal high hazard area that have been designated by the county or the American Red Cross as primary shelters meet this definition. 
    Vertical evacuation means the preplanned use of predetermined structures located in the hurricane vulnerability zone as hurricane shelters, and the on-site or in-place sheltering of residents in single-family or multifamily structures that are elevated above the predicted flood levels anticipated within the hurricane vulnerability zone. 
(Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-463), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-469. - Determining impacts. 
(a)  Authority. The city manager or designee have the authority and responsibility to determine the hurricane shelter and evacuation impacts. In the event of a dispute with respect to the level or amount of impact, the city manager's or designee's decision will control. The formulas for calculating the impacts are identified in this section. 
(b)  Shelter impacts. Shelter impacts are largely related to building issues (i.e., availability of actual appropriate shelter space). Impact on the hurricane shelter availability is calculated as follows: 
(1)  Residential units. 
a.  The following formula must be used for all dwelling units, living and housing units, mobile homes, recreational vehicle developments, health care facilities (Groups I, II and IV), and social services (Groups III and IV). 
b.  In health care facilities Groups I, II and IV, social services - Groups III and IV, and other similar group residences, each four beds will be counted as one residential unit. 
U × P = N 
N × SSr = Sp(r) 
(2)  Hotel/motel units. The following formula must be used for all hotels and motels: 
Hu × 0 = R 
R × Ssr = Sp(hu) 
(3)  Total units. 
Sp(r) + Sp(hu) = Sp (total spaces) 
Sp × Rfa = Sq(t) 
Notes: 
O = Number of people per unit. 
R = Residents in residence. 
N = Number of residents in development. 
U = Number of residential units. 
Hu = Number of hotel/motel units. 
P = Persons per household*. 
Rfa = Required square feet of shelter floor area per space (currently 20 square feet per space). 
Sp(r) = Shelter spaces needed by development's residential units. 
Sp(hu) = Shelter spaces needed by development's hotel/motel units. 
Ssr = Shelter seeking rate (currently 0.21 is used). 
Sq(t) = Total square feet of shelter floor area required for the development. 
For developments of regional impact, use the value set forth below that represents the closest year to the established buildout date: 
Year 2000 - 2.25. 
Year 2005 - 2.21. 
Year 2010 - 2.17. 
Year 2015 - 2.13. 
Year 2020 - 2.09. 
The city manager or designee has the discretion to permit the use of an alternative person per household (P) figure for nondevelopment of regional impact projects. Any alternative figure used must be supported by valid evidence, acceptable to the city manager or designee and derived from an established source. The applicant requesting the alternative figure is responsible for providing sufficient evidence to substantiate the alternative figure. 
(c)  Evacuation impacts. Evacuation impacts are largely related to the transportation infrastructure necessary to accommodate timely and efficient evacuation. Impacts on the evacuation time and infrastructure are calculated as follows: 
(1)  Step One. Calculate the number of evacuating vehicles for all residential units: 
EV(r) = U × V 
EV(r) = The number of evacuating vehicles for all residential units (i.e., single-family residential, multifamily, hotels/motels, etc.). 
U = The number of residential units. 
V =Number of vehicles per occupied unit. 
The current figure used is 1.1. 
(2)  Step Two. Calculate the total number of evacuating vehicles for all residential units in the development. 
? EV(r). 
(Ord. No. 05-02, § 3(2-464), 1-5-2005; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-464), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-470. - Impact mitigation. 
(a)  Authority. The city manager or designee will make the final decision with respect to the acceptability of the type and degree of mitigation offered to address the proposed development. This determination will be based upon consideration of the type and intensity of development, its location and the incremental effect on the hurricane preparedness program created by the development. The mitigation requested by the city must have a reasonable relationship to the incremental impact of the development. Appropriate calculation of the impacts in accordance with section 2-469 will constitute sufficient evidence of the reasonable relationship. The city manager or designee has the authority to deny acceptance of a proposed type of mitigation if the proposal is determined to be inappropriate for the location involved (e.g., vertical evacuation in a coastal high hazard area) or constitutes the creation of an unacceptable shelter facility (e.g., on-site shelter without all appropriate shutters). The option chosen by the developer to mitigate shelter and evacuation impacts must be fully implemented prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any residential dwelling unit that precipitates the requirement to mitigate under this article. However, this provision is not intended to prevent mitigation prior to the time a certificate of occupancy may be issued. 
(b)  Shelter impacts. One or a combination of the following options may be used to address the impacts on the hurricane shelter program precipitated by the proposed residential development. Acceptability and appropriateness of the type of mitigation proposed will be determined by the city manager. 
(1)  Land donation. A donation of land must meet the following minimum criteria: 
a.  The structure must be located outside the coastal high hazard area. 
b.  The land is capable of being used to reduce hurricane shelter impacts in the city. 
c.  The city will receive marketable fee title to the property. Property encumbered by a restriction that it be used solely for hurricane shelter purposes will be deemed unacceptable. 
d.  The value of the land donated will be determined as of the earliest date the requirement to provide hurricane preparedness mitigation becomes applicable based upon formal city action (i.e., rezoning, platting, etc.). 
(2)  Donate use of private structure. A donation of the use of a private structure must meet the following minimum criteria: 
a.  The structure must be located outside the coastal high hazard area. 
b.  The structure must be construed and capable of use as a primary public hurricane shelter. Specifically, the structure must be elevated to the anticipated category three flood level; constructed to withstand winds of at least 110 miles per hour; equipped with emergency power and potable water supplies; constructed with a minimum of exterior glass, while providing adequate protection by shutters or boards for any glass used; and have adequate ventilation, sanitary facilities and first-aid equipment. 
c.  For purposes of compliance with this article, the cost of providing or donating a structure for use as a primary hurricane shelter will be determined as the incremental cost difference attributable to bringing the structure up to primary public shelter standards from the original primary proposed use. 
(3)  Payment in lieu of donation of land or use of a private structure. The amount of a payment in lieu will be calculated using the following method or formula: 
a.  Step one. Calculate costs for shelter improvements. Multiply the total required square feet of shelter floor area from section 2-469(b) by $6.66 to determine costs for increased wind speed standards and elevation. 
Note: $1.34 per square foot of shelter space for increased essential facility wind speed standards; $5.32 increase for elevation of a square foot of shelter space above storm surge for a Category 3 hurricane; equals $6.66 per square foot of shelter space. 
b.  Step two. Emergency power costs. 
LPC × SF × PD × $200.00, divided by 1,000. 
5x20x1 (representing one person) x $200.00 divided by 1000 = $20.00 per person. 
Note: 
LDC = Number of watts per square foot for load and power consumption of typical uses. 
SF = 20 sq. feet, the minimum hurricane shelter space area per person, see F.A.C. ch. 9J-2.0256(1)(F). 
PD = Number of people in dwelling unit; 1 is used to calculate a per person cost. 
c.  Step three. Total costs from step one for sheltering and step two for emergency power (not including shuttering). 
($6.66 x = $ for increased wind speed standards and elevation, plus $20.00 per person; Sq) 
Note: Sq. = Total square feet from section 2-469(b) (i.e., the value derived for Sq(t)). 
(4)  On-site shelter. Provision of an on-site shelter must meet the following minimum criteria: 
a.  The on-site shelter must be located outside the coastal high hazard area. 
b.  The shelter space to be provided must, at minimum, equal the hurricane shelter space demand the proposed development is anticipated to create. 
c.  The structure must be elevated to the anticipated landfalling Category three flood level; constructed to withstand winds of at least 110 miles per hour for an essential facility; equipped with emergency power and potable water supplies; constructed either with exterior glass meeting STTD 12-97 standard (or equivalent) or with a minimum of exterior glass while providing adequate protection by shutters; and have adequate ventilation, sanitary facilities and first-aid equipment. 
d.  For purposes of compliance with this article, the cost of providing a structure for use as an on-site hurricane shelter will be determined as the incremental cost difference attributable to bringing the structure up to public shelter standards from the original or primary use. 
(5)  Public training of public hurricane shelter managers. Provision for training of public hurricane shelter managers must meet the following minimum criteria: 
a.  The training must be provided by the American Red Cross or county emergency management. 
b.  The city manager or designee has, in his sole discretion, determined that this is a viable method of mitigating the shelter impacts created by the proposed development. 
c.  Evacuation impacts . One or a combination of the options provided for in the remainder of this section may be used to address the impacts on hurricane evacuation routes with respect to evacuation timing and infrastructure precipitated by the proposed residential development. Acceptability and appropriateness of the type of mitigation proposed will be determined by the city manager and the public works department. 
(6)  Roadway elevation or improvements. Acceptability and appropriateness of this option will be determined by the DOT based upon the residential development vulnerability conditions. Mitigation under this option may include one or more of the following: 
a.  Construction of roads in the development or subdivision will be built to meet the same elevation of the nearest segment of a designated evacuation route. Determination as to the applicable route or segment will be made by the city manager in consultation with the city. 
b.  Construction of the main access or spine road in the development or subdivision to an elevation meeting the one in ten to the one in 25-year storm event. The city public works department will determine the applicable storm event standard. 
c.  Improvement of an off-site road that will be used by the subdivision or development for evacuation purposes. The road segment and standard for the road improvement will be determined by the city. 
(7)  Evacuation efficiency improvements. 
a.  Provision of funds to improve the ability to provide information to evacuees during actual evacuation situations or to improve the existing warning and notification system. Funds provided under this option may be used for items such as: 
1.  Communications equipment to convey real time conditions to the public on the roadways. 
2.  Information systems along major arterial evacuation routes to convey emergency information. 
b.  Decisions with respect to the expenditure of funds provided under this option will be made by the city manager or designee. All equipment purchases must be based upon an identified need for the additional equipment and must serve to upgrade the existing warning and notification system. 
(8)  Vertical evacuation. The viability of this mitigation option will be based upon the following criteria: 
a.  The structure must be elevated above the anticipated Category three landfalling hurricane storm surge and must be able to withstand wind speeds of at least 110 miles per hour for an essential facility. 
b.  The structure must be located outside the coastal high hazard area. 
(9)  Mitigation options that will address both shelter and evacuation impacts . One or a combination of the following options will constitute full mitigation of both shelter and hurricane evacuation impacts for the residential development: 
a.  Safe room. This option provides for construction of a room, within a residential building, that is designed to withstand a hurricane and is capable of accommodating the occupants of the dwelling. Viability of this mitigation option will be determined by the city manager based upon the following criteria: 
1.  The room selected for this purpose is built to the current standard set forth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a safe room. 
2.  The residential unit where the safe room is constructed is located outside the coastal high hazard area. 
b.  Elevation above hurricane flooding levels. This option requires construction of residential units above the category three landfalling storm surge level. This option is available only for construction located outside the coastal high hazard and does not subject the construction to standards in excess of those applicable in the county building codes. All funds collected in accordance with this article are required to be spent to mitigate the impacts of the development from which they are collected.

DIVISION 2. - HEARING EXAMINER ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE[9] 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
State Law reference- Special magistrate procedure authorized, F.S. § 162.03(2). 

Sec. 2-522. - Creation of position of hearing examiner. 
(a)  For the purpose of enforcing the city's codes and ordinances the city creates an alternate code enforcement system, pursuant to F.S. ch. 162, that gives hearing examiners the authority to hold hearings and impose fines, liens and other noncriminal penalties against violators of the city's codes and ordinances. 
(b)  Upon prior recommendation of the city manager, the city council by a majority vote may appoint hearing examiners, for a term of one-year. A hearing examiner shall be an individual who shall have been determined by the city council to have the knowledge, skill and abilities to perform as hearing examiner. 
(c)  Hearing examiners shall receive an hourly rate of compensation to be determined by the city council, with the recommendation of the city manager, based upon the prevailing rates for hearing examiners in the area with similar background and experience. 
(d)  Hearing examiners shall have the duties, powers and responsibilities and shall carry out the functions and procedures as set forth in this chapter. 
(e)  The city manager shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required for the proper performance of the hearing examiner's duties. 
(Ord. No. 03-10, § 1(2-421), 6-18-2003; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-471), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 2-523. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  Initiation of proceedings. It will be the duty of the code enforcement officer to initiate code enforcement proceedings. No hearing examiner shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Initial violation. Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a code enforcement officer finds a city code or ordinance violation, notice shall be given to the violator indicating the type of violation found and the manner in which it may be corrected. The notice must also provide a reasonable time in which to correct the violation. If the violation continues beyond the time provided, the code enforcement officer shall request a hearing before the hearing examiner. The clerical staff of the hearing examiner will schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing to the violator pursuant to section 2-130. A case may be presented to the hearing examiner even if the violation has been corrected, prior to the hearing, provided the violation was not corrected within the specified time period or the violation was corrected and reoccurred, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  Repeat violation. If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator of the type of violation and the manner in which it can be abated, but the violator is not entitled to a reasonable time to correct the violation. Once the violator has been notified of the repeat violation, the code enforcement officer shall request a hearing before the hearing examiner. The clerical staff of the hearing examiner shall schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing to the violator, pursuant to section 2-130. The case may be presented to the hearing examiner even if the repeat violation is corrected prior to the hearing and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the hearing examiner retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine the costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his rights to this hearing and pay the costs as determined by the hearing examiner. 
(d)  Immediate hearing. If the code enforcement officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator, and may request an immediate hearing before the hearing examiner. 
(e)  Transfer of property. If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before a hearing examiner or a court, transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing examiner hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and the materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a written notice with the code enforcement official disclosing the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(f)  Notification of parties. In addition to notifying the violator as provided in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the code enforcement officer, clerical staff or other persons designated by the city manager may also provide notice by mail or other means to the mortgage holders and/or other persons or entities having an interest in the subject property. 
(Ord. No. 03-10, § 1(2-424), 6-18-2003; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-474), 12-18-2013) 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. 162.06. 
Sec. 2-524. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Scheduling of hearings. The hearing examiner will designate a regular time and place for code enforcement hearings based upon the number of cases to be heard. Upon request of the code enforcement officer or at such other times as may be necessary, the hearing examiner may call hearings to take place on a day or at a time not regularly set aside for code enforcement hearings. The clerical staff of the hearing examiner is responsible for scheduling cases to be heard by the hearing examiner. All code enforcement proceedings and hearings shall be open to the public, and minutes shall be kept of all hearings. 
(b)  Prosecution of the case. Each case on the code enforcement docket will be presented to the hearing examiner by a city attorney or code enforcement officer familiar with the case. If the city is successful in prosecuting a case before the hearing examiner, it will be entitled to recover a civil penalty of up to $250.00 for initial proceeding and up to $500.00 for proceedings that are repeat violation. 
(c)  Hearing testimony. The hearing examiner will proceed to hear the cases and shall take testimony from members of the code enforcement staff and alleged violators. All testimony will be under oath and recorded. Formal rules of evidence will not apply, but fundamental due process is to be observed and will govern the proceedings. 
(d)  Hearing examiner order. At the conclusion of the hearing, and based upon the evidence presented, the hearing examiner shall issue findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order affording appropriate relief consistent with the powers granted herein. An order finding a violation may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that failure to comply by that date may result in a fine being imposed in the amount stated in the order and, if the violation is abated by the city, the cost of repairs may be included with the fine. 
(e)  Recording the order. A certified copy of the order finding violation may be recorded in the public records of Lee County and will be binding on the violator. If the recorded order concerns real property it will constitute notice to, and be binding upon, any subsequent purchasers, successor in interest, or assigns. If an order finding violation is recorded in the public records and subsequently complied with by the date specified in the order, the hearing examiner must issue an order acknowledging compliance that is also recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue an order acknowledging compliance. 
(Ord. No. 03-10, § 1(2-425), 6-18-2003; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-475), 12-18-2013) 
State Law reference- Similar provision, F.S. § 162.07. 
Sec. 2-525. - Powers of the code enforcement hearing examiner. 
    The hearing examiner shall have the power and authority to: 
(1)  Adopt rules for the conduct of code enforcement hearings. 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to code enforcement hearings. Subpoenas may be served by the sheriff of the county. 
(3)  Subpoena evidence to code enforcement hearings. 
(4)  Take testimony under oath. 
(5)  Issue orders having the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance. 
(Ord. No. 03-10, § 1(2-426), 6-18-2003; Ord. No. 13-21, § 1(2-476), 12-18-2013) 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.08. 
Sec. 2-526. - Administrative fines, cost of repair, and liens. 
(a)  Order imposing fine/lien. Upon notification by the code enforcement officer that the violator has failed to comply with the hearing examiner's order within the time specified or, upon finding a repeat violation has occurred, the hearing examiner may order the violator to pay a fine. The fine may be imposed for each day the violation continues past the date specified for compliance. In the case of a repeat violation, a fine may be imposed for each day the repeat violation continues beginning with the date the code enforcement officer first documents a violation exists. The hearing examiner may impose additional fines to include any enforcement costs incurred by the city. The city may make all reasonable repairs required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed under this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. A hearing will not be necessary for the issuance of an order imposing the fine if a finding of a violation or repeat violation has been made as provided herein. If after due notice and hearing a hearing examiner finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Penalties. 
(1)  A fine imposed under this section cannot exceed $250.00 per day for the first violation or $500.00 per day for a repeat violation. However, if the hearing examiner finds a violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, a fine of up to $5,000.00 per violation can be imposed. Further, the fine may include the cost of all repairs incurred in accordance with subsection (a) of this section as well as the cost of prosecuting the case before the hearing examiner. 
(2)  The following factors will be considered by the hearing examiner in determining the fine to be imposed: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
The hearing examiner may mitigate the fine imposed under this section. 
(4)  If the violation is of the type described in section 2-130, all such sums shall become immediately due and payable upon expenditure by the city and shall become delinquent if not paid within 30 days after notice to the violator of either the city's bill or hearing examiner's order itemizing the costs incurred. All such delinquent sums shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum. 
(c)  Creation of a lien. A certified copy of an order imposing fines or imposing fine(s) plus costs of repair or imposing fines plus cost of repair plus any delinquency charges may be recorded in the public records and thereafter will constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the Sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order will not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed under this article will continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is tendered in a suit to foreclose the lien, whichever occurs first. Proof of compliance must be submitted to the code enforcement officer. 
(d)  Release or satisfaction of lien. A lien arising from a fine imposed under this section runs in favor of the city council and the city council may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered in accordance with this section. A release or satisfaction of lien may be executed by the mayor on behalf of the entire city council. The mayor on behalf of the city council upon full payment may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section; in the event of settlement for less than the full amount of said lien, satisfaction or release shall require a mitigation hearing before the hearing examiner. Mitigation will be processed as follows: 
(1)  The person requesting mitigation must be a property owner, authorized agent, or be in the position to be acquiring the property. If the person does not have title, the Director can negotiate a proposed plan for mitigation and hold the hearing before the hearing examiner, but any Release of the Lien will not take place until such time the person has taken title. 
(2)  The director will consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in determining their recommendation for reduction of the lien arising from the fine imposed. 
(3)  In no circumstance will the fine be greater than the assessed value of the property, as based on the most recent appraisal by the Lee County Property Appraiser. 
(4)  City council may, from time to time upon adoption of a resolution, create an amnesty program allowing abatement at a reduced rate as set forth in a formula during a specific time period. 
(5)  The director may upon his own initiative send letters to outstanding property owners to create an internal mitigation program for the purpose of reducing liens running over five years for the purpose of seeking abatement. 
(4)  Mitigation may not be used for purposes of rehearing or appeal of the original order imposing the fine. 
(e)  Lien foreclosure. The hearing examiner may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on a lien which remains unpaid for a period of three or more months after filing. In no circumstance will the lien be greater than the assessed value of the property, as based on the most recent appraisal by the Lee County Property Appraiser. No lien created under this article may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under section 4, article X of the state constitution. 
(f)  Duration of lien. A lien established in accordance with the provisions of this article may not continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on the lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city is entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of an action will not be enforceable against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a lis pendens is recorded.

    The city council's authority to designate certain city employees or agents as code enforcement officers under this section, F.S. § 162.21, and other regulations, is delegated to the city manager or his designee. Delegation of the city council's authority requires a determination by the city manager, or his designee, that those employees or agents to be designated have met all requirements for designation. These requirements include the employee's or agent's compliance with the terms of any agreements between the city and other entities, as well as the successful completion of all required certification and training. The training and qualifications necessary to be a code enforcement officer will be determined by the city manager, or his designee. Employees or agents who may be designated as code enforcement officers include, but are not limited to, code inspectors, law enforcement officers, animal control officers, or fire safety inspectors. Designation as a code enforcement officer does not provide the code enforcement officer with the power of arrest or subject the code enforcement officer to the provisions of F.S. §§ 943.085 through 943.255.

(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-1), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-2. - Purpose of chapter. 
    The city council finds that the present and probable future growth of population, commerce and industry in the city is of such magnitude and complexity that the prudent regulation of land development is required in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to implement the city's comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-2), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-3. - Interpretation of chapter. 
(a)  This chapter shall be construed to be the minimum regulations necessary for the purpose of meeting the general and specific requirements named in this chapter. 
(b)  Where any provision of this chapter imposes a restriction different from that imposed by any other provision of this chapter or any other ordinance, regulation or law, other than definitions, the provision which is more restrictive shall apply. 
(c)  Section 4-1122 et seq., establishes a redevelopment overlay district which provides for the preparation and adoption of master plans for community redevelopment areas or portions thereof. The master plan may contain development regulations which supersede some or all of chapter 4, this chapter, and other land development regulations. 
(d)  In areas for which a master plan has been adopted, as set forth in chapter 4, a property owner may elect to develop/redevelop in compliance with the master plan or in compliance with existing zoning and development regulations. 
(e)  If the property owner elects to comply with the adopted master plan, then to the extent that such plan addresses a regulation set forth in chapter 4, this chapter, or in any other land development regulation, the master plan will take precedence. To the extent that the master plan does not address a regulation, the standard regulations shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-3), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-4. - Enforcement of chapter; penalty. 
    The city manager, designee or any person with standing, is authorized to pursue any one of a combination of the enforcement mechanisms provided in this Code for any violation of this chapter Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of the requirements in this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be punishable as provided in section 1-5, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-6), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-5. - General requirements. 
(a)  Development shall occur in the city in compliance with this chapter, as well as local, state and federal air, water, and noise pollution standards. 
(b)  Development shall occur in the city in compliance with the comprehensive plan and all applicable city ordinances. No development order or permit shall be issued if the development order or permit results in a further reduction in the levels of service for the affected roads below the levels of service provided for in the city comprehensive plan, unless appropriate mitigation is provided or the applicant otherwise complies with chapter 2, article II, relating to concurrency management. However, notwithstanding this limitation, in no event shall a developer be required by the operation of this chapter to mitigate impacts caused by earlier development. For purposes of applying this subsection, in the case of developments expected to add less than 300 vehicle trips during the peak hour to the adjacent road system, the developer shall be presumed conclusively to have mitigated the off-site impact on roads caused by the development if the developer pays whatever roads impact fees are required by applicable city roads impact fee ordinances. In all cases, the developer shall be responsible for the full cost of site-related improvements. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided for in this chapter, permits for development, including building permits, shall only be issued after the issuance of, and in compliance with, a development order. No development permit, building permit, tree removal permit, or notice of clearing shall be issued on a parcel of land, or any portion thereof, that is the subject of existing code violations, development standards ordinance violations or other land development ordinance violations, regardless of whether the applicant or his principal owned the property at the time the violation occurred. However, this subsection shall not prevent issuance of a permit for the specific purpose of resolving or abating the violation. 
(d)  During development and construction activities, the developer must take every reasonable precaution to avoid dust, debris and smoke from blowing onto adjacent properties. When, in the city manager or designee's opinion, conditions are such that dust or debris is adversely affecting adjacent properties, a stop work order may be issued until the conditions are mitigated. The proposed method of mitigation, which may include temporary silt fencing, sprinkling the area with water, seeding or sodding, or other similar measures, must be approved by the city manager or designee. 
(e)  All developments must remain in compliance with the terms and conditions of the approved development order even after issuance of a certificate of completion. 
(f)  All developments, including redevelopment projects, must meet the intent of the bicycle and pedestrian master plan, Bonita Beach Road Visioning Study, and the complete streets policy, as described in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-7), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 06-03, 3-15-2006; Ord. No. 18-05, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 3-6. - Specific requirements. 
    Development will be approved and a development order will be issued when the development is designed so as to reasonably achieve the following: 
(1)  Preservation of ecological integrity. The development shall protect the city's natural, historic, and scenic resources, including air, surface, and subsurface waters, and shall preserve their ecological integrity. No new causeways which require filling of wetlands or submerged lands shall be constructed to any island. 
(2)  Traffic pattern. There shall be adequate bicycle, pedestrian, and vehicular (multi-modal) ingress and egress to the development. Additionally, the development shall also achieve the following: 
a.  Ingress and egress areas shall be of sufficient width to provide for servicing of utilities, refuse collection, and access for emergency vehicles. 
b.  Development shall not cause traffic hazards or congestion which results from narrow or poorly aligned streets or from excessive exit and entrance points along arterial and collector streets. 
c.  The development shall be designed so as to minimize traffic impacts on surrounding areas, particularly to prevent traffic related to industrial land uses (see chapter 4) from traveling through predominantly residential areas. Main access points to a development will not be established where traffic is required to travel over local streets through areas with significantly lower densities or intensities, e.g., multifamily access through single-family residential areas, except where adequate mitigation can be provided. 
d.  The development shall be designed so as to allow for access by emergency vehicles. 
e.  Traffic impact mitigation/studies. In order to evaluate traffic patterns, traffic circulation, and traffic impacts of a development, a traffic impact statement shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. A traffic impact statement is necessary to: 
1.  Provide vital information to public decision makers who must evaluate development proposals and traffic impacts generated by a development; 
2.  Ensure that safe and efficient access is provided to the development; 
3.  Minimize the proposed development's adverse traffic impacts and minimize traffic congestion on the road system; 
4.  Monitor growth and development for the preparation of subarea and corridor transportation studies; 
5.  Establish the appropriate timing for needed road and intersection improvements to ensure that public roadway capacity is available when demand is anticipated to occur; and 
6.  Provide the technical background and assumptions needed to plan road improvements. 
f.  Traffic impact mitigation plan. In order to mitigate the traffic impacts of a development, a traffic impact mitigation plan shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. 
The technical requirements regarding traffic impact statements and traffic impact mitigation plans are specified in article III, division 2, of this chapter. 
(3)  Official trafficways map. Pursuant to the city comprehensive plan, there is hereby adopted as part of this chapter the official trafficways map for the city, as it may be amended from time to time. 
(4)  Bicycle and pedestrian master plan. The purpose of this plan, adopted on February 15, 2017 and as amended, is to guide the creation of an efficient multimodal transportation system for the city. This system will enhance connectivity for different travel modes and be inclusive of diverse users. Bike facilities and pedestrian facilities are necessary along the roadways depicted on the bicycle and pedestrian master plan for the benefit and protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city because those facilities serve to: 
a.  Lessen traffic congestion and improve pedestrian and bicycle networks and connectivity; 
b.  Reduce conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian/cyclist movement; 
c.  Provide safe pedestrian and bicycle circulation to community facilities, including existing and future development or redevelopment; 
d.  Provide safe access to active and passive recreational activity for all users. 
(5)  Access roads. Pursuant to the city comprehensive plan, there is hereby adopted as part of this chapter the access road location map for the city as may be amended. 
(6)  Water and sewage systems. The development must be proposed in such a way as to prevent any potential hazards to the health, safety, and welfare of the public, especially with regard to the provision of potable water or sanitary sewage services. 
(7)  Drainage and stormwater management. 
a.  The development must be designed in accordance with applicable city and water management districts' runoff, retention and attenuation requirements and any other state and local drainage laws. The development must also be designed to avoid flooding or erosion damage to adjacent property and the city drainage system and to avoid the creation of stagnant pools that would encourage mosquito breeding.

The city manager or designee shall periodically inspect all construction of streets and drainage improvements, including those improvements which are not to be dedicated to the public but are subject to this chapter. The city manager or designee will immediately call to the attention of the developer, or the developer's engineer, any nonconforming work or deficiencies in the work. Correction of deficiencies in the work is the responsibility of the developer. It is the responsibility of the developer to notify the city manager or designee 24 hours before a phase of the work is ready for inspection to schedule the inspection. Inspection reports that document the results of the inspection shall be prepared by the city inspector. 
(b)  Specific inspections. 
(1)  Inspections of the following phases of work are required: 
a.  Drainage pipe after pipe joints are cemented or sealed. 
b.  Headwall footings. 
c.  Roadway subgrade. 
d.  Roadway base. 
e.  Asphalt prime coat and all surface courses. 
f.  Final site inspection. 
(2)  The thickness of the roadway base shall be measured under the direction of the city inspector at intervals of not more than 200 lineal feet in holes through the base of not less than three inches in diameter. Where compacted base is deficient by more than one-half inch, the contractor shall correct such areas by scarifying and adding material for a distance of 100 feet in each direction from the edge of the deficient area, and the affected area shall then be brought to the required state of compaction and to the required thickness and cross section. 
(3)  Seeding and mulching or sodding over all unpaved areas within rights-of-way or roadways will be required at the time of final inspection. 
(4)  Inspection requirements for water and sewer utility systems are specified in section 3-357. 
(c)  Testing of roadway subgrade, base, and shoulders. The developer shall have the roadway subgrade, base, and shoulders tested for limerock bearing ratio and compaction by a certified testing laboratory. The location and quantity of tests shall be determined by the city manager or designee. There shall be a minimum of one test per 1,000 feet, or two per project. Prior to acceptance by the city, a copy of the test results shall be furnished to the city manager or designee. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-182), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-193. - Final inspection and certificate of compliance. 
(a)  Upon completion of all development required under the approved development order, or phase thereof, an inspection shall be performed by the developer's engineer or his designated representative. Upon finding the development to be completed and in substantial compliance with the approved development order documents, the engineer shall submit a signed and sealed letter of substantial compliance to the city manager or designee along with a final inspection request. No final inspection will be performed by the city until the letter of substantial compliance has been accepted. The letter of substantial compliance may include a submittal for a minor change with highlighted plans showing minor changes which do not substantially affect the technical requirements of this chapter as described in section 3-98. Letters of substantial compliance shall be in a form approved by the city manager or designee or city attorney or designee. 
(b)  Substantial compliance means that the development, as determined by an on-site inspection by a professional engineer or his designated representative, is completed to all the specifications of the approved development order plans and that any deviation between the approved development order plans and actual as-built construction is so inconsequential that, on the basis of accepted engineering practices, it is not significant enough to be shown on the development site plans. 
(c)  Upon acceptance of the letter of substantial compliance and a request for final inspection, the city manager or designee shall perform the final inspection. If the final inspection reveals that the development or phase thereof is in substantial compliance with the approved development order, a certificate of compliance will be issued. A certificate of compliance is required prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy from the city. If the final inspection reveals that the development or phase thereof is not in substantial compliance with the approved development order, a list of all deviations shall be forwarded to the engineer. All deviations must be corrected per the amendment and minor change procedure and a new letter of substantial compliance submitted and accepted prior to a reinspection by the city manager or designee. Applications for amendments, minor changes, inspections and reinspections shall be charged a fee in accordance with the adopted fee schedule. 
(d)  If more than one building is covered by the development order, a certificate of compliance for streets, utilities, parking areas, and drainage serving each building shall be required prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy from the city manager or designee. If a final inspection is requested for only a portion of a development, that portion must be an approved phase of the development in accordance with the development order plans. 
(e)  A development project must remain in compliance with the development order, including all conditions, after a letter of substantial compliance, certificate of compliance or certificate of occupancy has been issued by the city. This requirement applies to any property covered by the development order, whether or not it continues to be owned by the original developer. For purposes of determining compliance, the terms of the development order as issued, or subsequently amended in accordance with this chapter, will control. The standards applicable to review for compliance purposes will be based upon the regulations in effect at the time the development order, or any applicable amendment, was issued. 
(f)  Improvements constructed pursuant to a development order may not be placed into service or otherwise utilized until the required certificate of compliance has been issued for the development order.

    For all new mobile home or recreational vehicle developments there shall be required an emergency shelter, which shall be a building of wood frame, metal, or CBS construction. The size of each emergency shelter shall be determined by using the total number of units and spaces multiplied by 2.4 (representing the average number of persons per household), multiplied by the shelter space requirement of 20 square feet of usable floorspace per person, and multiplied by the maximum estimated percentage of evacuating population that would use a shelter (45 percent), which would equal the total required size of the emergency shelter. In no case, however, shall this section be interpreted to require construction of a shelter with less than 1,000 square feet of floor area. The shelter shall be elevated to a minimum height equal to or above the worst case Category 3 flooding level utilizing the National Weather Service Storm Surge Model, "SLOSH." 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-258), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-266. - Placement of structures in easements. 
    No buildings or structures shall be placed in easements where placing a building or structure in the easement is contrary to the terms of the easement or interferes with the use of the easement.

(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-261), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-269. - Outdoor lighting. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this provision is to curtail and reverse the degradation of the night time visual environment by minimizing light pollution glare and light trespass through regulation of the form and use of outdoor lighting; and to conserve energy and resources while maintaining nighttime safety, utility security and productivity. 
(b)  Applicability. All new luminaires on commercial developments, regardless of whether a development order is required, must comply with the provisions and standards of this section. All legal nonconforming building mounted luminaries must meet current standards by January 1, 2020. 
(c)  General exemptions. The following are generally exempt from the provisions of this section: 
(1)  Emergency lighting required for public safety and hazard warning luminaires required by federal or state regulatory agencies; 
(2)  Outdoor light fixtures producing light directly by the combustion of fossil fuels, such as kerosene and gasoline; 
(3)  Low wattage holiday decorative lighting fixtures (comprised by incandescent bulbs of less than eight watts each or other lamps of output less than 100 lumens each) used for holiday decoration; 
(4)  Lighting for public roads except as provided in section 7-46; 
(5)  Outdoor lighting for single- and two-family residential units. 
(d)  Standards and criteria. In addition to the standards and criteria for outdoor lighting established in this subsection, there are standards for sea turtle lighting in chapter 7. When specific standards are not addressed in these sources, the standards of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) will apply. 
(1)  Illuminance. Table 1 is provided as a general synopsis of the illumination level requirements. These levels are based upon general use or task categories and are measured in footcandles on the task surface (for example the parking lot or area surface) with a light meter held parallel to the ground or other surface, facing up, unless otherwise specifically stated. 
Table 1. Illumination Level Requirements (1) 
Use/Task Initial Actual 
Footcandles (2), (4) Initial 
Uniformity 
Average (3) Parking, multi-family Low vehicular/pedestrian activity 0.3 min. 4:1 Medium vehicular/pedestrian activity 0.8 min. 4:1 Parking, industrial/commercial/institutional, municipal High activity (e.g., shopping centers, fast food facilities, major athletic/civic, cultural events) 1.2 min. 4:1 Medium activity (e.g., office parks, hospitals, commuter lots, cultural/civic/recreational events) 0.8 min. 4:1 Low activity (e.g., neighborhood shopping, industrial employee parking, school, church) 0.3 min. 4:1 Non-residential walkways and bikeways 0.3 min. 5:1 Canopy drive-thru fuel pumps, overhang 6.0 min. 5:1  
Notes: 
(1)  These specified illumination level criteria are the initial actual levels to be measured at the time of final inspection for a certificate of compliance. The outdoor lighting must be maintained so the average illumination levels do not increase above the specified values. The minimum illumination levels may decrease over time consistent with the Light Loss Factor (LLF) associated with the installed fixtures. 
(2)  In no case may the illumination exceed 0.5 footcandle measured at the property line. The amount of illumination projected onto a residentially zoned property or use from another property may not exceed 0.2 footcandle measured at ten feet from the property line onto the adjacent residential property. 
(3)  Uniformity ratios dictate that the average illumination values may not exceed initial values by more than the product of the initial value and the specific ratio. For example, in the case of commercial parking and high activity the initial average illuminance may not be in excess of 4.8 footcandles (1.2 × 4). 
(4)  Where all-night safety or security lighting is to be provided for establishments that are not operational 24 hours a day, the lighting intensity levels should provide the lowest possible illumination to discourage crime and undesirable activity and to effectively allow surveillance but may not exceed 50 percent of the levels normally permitted for the use as specified in this code. 
(2)  Luminaire standards. Fully shielded, full cutoff luminaires with recessed bulbs are the only permitted fixtures for outdoor lighting with the following exceptions: 
a.  Luminaires that have a maximum output of 260 lumens per fixture (the approximate output of one 20 watt incandescent bulb) regardless of number of bulbs, may be left unshielded provided the fixture has an opaque top to keep light from shining directly up. 
b.  Luminaires that have an output of no more than 1,000 lumens per fixture (the approximate output of one 60 watt incandescent bulb) regardless of number of bulbs, may be partially shielded, provided the bulb is not visible, and the fixture has an opaque top to keep light from shining directly up. 
c.  Sensor activated lighting may be unshielded provided it is located in such a manner as to prevent direct glare and lighting into properties of others or into a public right-of-way and provided the light is set to only go on when activated and to go off within five minutes after activation has ceased, and the light must not be triggered by activity off the property. 
d.  Flood or spot luminaires with a lamp or lamps rated at no more than 900 lumens may be used except that no spot or flood luminaire may be aimed, directed, or focused such as to cause direct light from the luminaire to be directed toward residential buildings on adjacent or nearby land, or to create glare perceptible to persons operating motor vehicles on public ways, or directed skyward or directed towards the shoreline areas, The luminaire must be redirected or aimed so that illumination is directed to the designated areas and its light output controlled as necessary to eliminate such conditions. Illumination resulting from such lighting must be considered as contributing to the illumination levels specified herein. Flood or spot luminaires with a lamp or lamps rated at more than 900 lumens are subject to the general luminaire standards in subsection (2) of this section. 
e.  All externally illuminated billboards and signs must be lighted by shielded fixtures mounted at the top of the sign and aimed downward. Outdoor advertising signs of the type constructed of translucent materials and wholly illuminated from within do not require shielding. Dark backgrounds with light lettering, or symbols is preferred to minimize detrimental effects. Illumination resulting from sign lighting must be considered as contributing to the illumination levels specified herein. 
f.  Fixtures used to accent architectural features, materials, colors, style of buildings landscaping or art must be located, aimed and shielded so that light is directed only on those features. Such fixtures must be aimed or shielded to minimize light spill onto adjacent properties or into the night sky in conformance with illumination and luminaire standards. 
(3)  Luminaire mount standards. The following standards apply to luminaire mountings: 
a.  Free standing luminaires. Light poles must be placed on the interior of the site. When light poles are proposed to be placed on the perimeter of the site, specific consideration should be addressed to compliance with the illumination standards at the property line and off the property onto adjacent residential property. The maximum height of light poles for parking lots and vehicular use areas may not exceed 25 feet measured from the ground level directly below the luminaire to the bottom of the lamp itself. Light poles located within 50 feet of a residentially zoned property or use may not exceed 15 feet. Poles used to illuminate pedestrian walkways may not exceed 15 feet. Lighting for outdoor recreational facilities (public or private) such as but not limited to football fields, soccer fields, baseball fields, softball fields, tennis courts, etc., are exempt from the mounting height standards provided that all other applicable provisions are met. 
b.  Building mounted luminaires. These luminaires may only be attached to the building walls and the top of the fixture may not exceed the height of the parapet or the roof, or 25 feet, whichever is the lowest. 
c.  Nonresidential canopy lighting. 
1.  Application. This subsection applies to all nonresidential development only. Single-family, two-family, and multi-unit residential developments are not subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
2.  Standard. Light fixtures mounted on the underside of a canopy must be recessed or shielded full cutoff type so that the light is restrained to 85 degrees or less from the vertical. As an alternative (or supplement) to the canopy ceiling lights, indirect lighting may be used where the light is beamed upward and then reflected down from the underside of the canopy. When this method is used, light fixtures must be shielded so that direct illumination is focused exclusively on the underside of the canopy. No part of the canopy may be back-lighted. Lights may not be mounted on the top or sides (fascias) of the canopy. The sides (fascias) of the canopy may not be illuminated in any manner. 
d.  Lighting standards for large-scale retail establishments 
1.  In addition to the outdoor commercial lighting standards set forth in this section, light poles for developments with large-scale retail establishments must be located outside of all parking islands that contain required canopy trees. 
2.  Any freestanding light poles located outside of parking islands with large-scale retail establishments must be surrounded by a base that is consistent with and complimentary to the principal building style. 
e.  Trees and landscaping. To avoid conflicts between light poles and trees, locations of all light poles and fixtures must be coordinated with the locations of all trees and landscaping whether existing or shown on the landscaping plan. Vegetation screens may not be employed to serve as the means for controlling glare. Glare control must be achieved through the use of such means as cutoff fixtures, shields and baffles, and appropriate application of fixture mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and fixture placement. 
(e)  Development order and permit criteria. The applicant for any development order or building permit, as applicable under the provisions of this LDC involving outdoor lighting fixtures, must submit as part of the application evidence that the proposed work will comply with the outdoor lighting standards of this LDC. Specifically the submission must include the following: 
(1)  Plans indicating the location on the premises and the type of illuminating devices, fixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors and other devices. 
(2)  A detailed description of the illuminating devices, fixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors, and other devices under consideration for the project, with as much detail as possible, including manufacturer's catalogue cuts and drawings including pictures, sections, and proposed wattages for each fixture. Once a lighting device has been chosen, the developer must submit all information listed above related to the selected lighting device. In no case may a certificate of compliance be issued prior to the submission of the required information related to the developer's lighting device selection. 
(3)  All applications for development orders or building permits, except for single-family and duplex building permits, must provide photometric data, such as that furnished by the manufacturer of the proposed illuminating devices, showing the angle of cut-off and other characteristics of the light emissions including references to the standards contained herein. 
(4)  All applications for development orders or building permits except for single-family and duplex building permits, must provide photometrics in initial footcandles output for all proposed and existing fixtures on-site shown on a 20 foot by 20 foot grid on an appropriately scaled plan. On-site lighting to be included in the calculations must include, but is not limited to, lighting for parking lot, canopies and building mounted and recessed lighting along the building facades and overhangs. The photometric plan must include a table showing the average minimum and maximum footcandles of illumination on the site and within 50 feet of the site and the calculations deriving the averages. Evidence must be provided demonstrating that the proposed lighting plan will comply with the requirements of this LDC. The use of a Light Loss Factor (LLF) is not permitted in these photometrics. This photometric plan must be coordinated with the landscape plan to identify the location of trees and other landscaping features with respect to the lighting devices. Rejection or acceptance of the photometric plan will be based on this LDC. 
(f)  Compliance. 
(1)  Prior to the final inspection for a certificate of compliance pursuant to section 3-193, site verified footcandle readings must be provided demonstrating that the outdoor lighting, as installed, conforms with the proposed photometrics and the letter of substantial compliance provided by a registered professional engineer must include a certification that the outdoor lighting is in compliance with this LDC. 
(2)  If any outdoor light fixture or the type of light source therein, is changed after the permit or development order has been issued, a change request or development order amendment must be submitted for approval together with adequate information to assure compliance with this LDC. This request or amendment must be approved prior to the installation of the proposed change. 
(3)  Outdoor lighting must be maintained in compliance with this LDC. 
(g)  Existing outdoor lighting. The requirements of this section shall apply to all new and replacement fixtures and for any building mounted luminaries after January 1, 2020. See subsection (b) of this section. 
(h)  Security lighting within public or private rights-of-way. 
(1)  Security lighting is designed to provide for safety and security by illuminating all or a portion of a commercial or industrial site. This type of lighting is not associated with architectural or aesthetic reasons. Security lighting falls within the statutory definition of streetlights pursuant to F.S. § 768.1382, and any change in security lighting must comply with that statute. 
(2)  Location of security lighting. 
(i)  Installation within public or private rights-of-way. 
A.  Security lighting may be placed upon fixtures or property controlled by the power supplying franchisee or statutory streetlight provider at a location determined to be appropriate to provide security for a site, but may not be directed to induce glare upon adjacent properties or onto the right-of-way. 
B.  For security lighting placed within a right-of-way, fixtures must be fully shielded, full cutoff luminaires with recessed bulbs so that no light is directed above the fixture. Lighting location and specifications must address bicycle and pedestrian safety measures. 
C.  Size, type, and location. 
1.  Security lighting features may not exceed 25 feet in height. 
2.  Security lights may not be placed closer than 50 feet to another security light unless a need can be shown as to why additional lighting is necessary. 
3.  A request for additional lighting will be processed as an administrative deviation from this chapter 3. 
4.  Security lighting will be permitted where the illumination does not exceed 0.5 footcandles measured (except for the property line where the light is located) when adjacent to commercially zoned property and 0.2 footcandles measured at the property line when adjacent to residential property. 
5.  LED lighting is preferred over metal halide lighting.

Sec. 3-288. - Liability insurance requirement. 
    All construction proposed within city maintained rights-of-way must be performed in compliance with Administrative Code. The applicant must obtain liability insurance coverage for the benefit of the city as specified in AC-XX-XX as a stipulation of the development order approval for projects requiring a right-of-way permit to construct improvements within city-owned or controlled right-of-way property. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-281), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 18-05, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 3-289. - Special access provisions for Bonita Beach Road. 
(a)  Within the incorporated limits of the city, the minimum connection separation for any access to Bonita Beach Road is 660 feet. Property that has frontage or other means of access to a side, or secondary street that is parallel or perpendicular to Bonita Beach Road should connect to that street or be granted cross access to allow the property to be accessed by the secondary street. 
(b)  Where the property does not have access to another street or cannot meet the minimum separation requirement for Bonita Beach Road, the city manager or designee may grant a temporary access to Bonita Beach Road; provided that: 
(1)  The property owner executes a temporary access agreement stipulating that, upon an alternate access becoming available, the temporary access will be removed and connection will be made to the alternative access easement at the owner's expense, within 90 calendar days of written notice by the city manager or designee; and 
(2)  The temporary access agreement is recorded in the official records of the county and a copy of said recording is submitted to the city manager or designee prior to the approval of a development order or change of use permit. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-282), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 18-05, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 3-290. - Functional classification of city roads. 
(a)  City-maintained roads will be classified by the city manager or designee based upon the existing functions of the roads and the guidelines provided in the city comprehensive plan, and in accordance with the administrative code regulating city functional classification. These classifications will be used to determine compliance with all city regulations which are dependent on functional classification, except those regulations that will rely on the future roadway classifications as noted below. For the purpose of determining compliance with the connection spacing and right-of-way width/design speed requirements of this chapter, the future classification of the official trafficways map will be used to classify arterial and collector streets. All development standards for new roadways will also be based on the future classifications in the official trafficways map. The city manager or designee will update the existing functional classifications from time to time as needed, and will present the map and list to the council for adoption in accordance with the related administrative code section. 
(b)  All privately maintained roads, both existing and proposed, will be classified by the city manager or designee based upon the existing functions of the roads and the guidelines provided in the city comprehensive plan, and in accordance with the administrative code section regulating city functional classification. These classifications will be used to determine compliance with all city regulations pertaining to privately maintained roads. These regulations will include determining compliance with connection spacing, and street design and construction standards. The city manager or designee will update these functional classifications from time to time as needed, and will provide these classifications to the city manager or designee for incorporation into the related administrative code referenced in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-284), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-291. - Connection separation. 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  Connections of streets, access roads or accessways must be in accordance with the minimum standards in Table 1, below and the additional provisions of this section. 
Table 1. Connection Separation 
Functional Classification Centerline Distance 
(feet) Arterial 660 Collector 330 Local 125 Access roads or accessways 60  
(2)  Driveways to a single residential building of two dwelling units or less on local streets may be spaced closer than the connection spacing requirements specified for local streets in Table 1. Where residential lots are proposed for subdivision on arterial or collector streets as allowed under section 3-159(3), the city manager or designee may authorize lesser separation distance if joint access agreements are provided to preserve or maximize driveway connection separation distances. On local streets, where frontage dimensions of existing platted commercial or industrial lots do not accommodate required connection separation distances, the city manager or designee will assign the access point to accommodate spacing and safety concerns. 
(b)  Access roads that intersect another road that also intersects the parallel arterial or collector must have an outer separation of at least 100 feet from the edge of the pavement of the arterial or collector. 
(c)  On arterial or collector streets where an access road is not required by the city, existing parcels that have insufficient road frontage to meet the minimum connection separation required in Table 1 are required to provide a shared access with the adjoining property within an appropriate cross-access easement. 
(d)  Existing corner commercial parcels on an arterial will be permitted a right-in/right-out connection at no less than 330 feet from the intersecting public street if the parcel is not large enough as of January 1, 1998, to provide standard spacing and if the owner agrees to provide a permanent cross access easement to the adjoining property. If shared access on the arterial is not practical, the connection may be right-out only, if downstream of the nearby intersection; and right-in only, if upstream of the nearby intersection. Any property so small that this minimum cannot be met will be granted a temporary right-in/right-out connection on the arterial or one temporary single direction connection on each of the streets as described above, to be used until an access road has been provided. Lot splits will not be allowed on corner lots that cause the new parcels to be too small to meet the minimum connection separation standards in Table 1, unless the property owner provides an alternative form of access to the new corner parcel. 
(e)  Existing corner commercial parcels on a collector will be permitted a right-in/right-out connection at a minimum of 245 feet from the intersecting public street if the owner agrees to provide a permanent cross access easement to the adjoining property. If shared access on the collector is not practical, the connection may be right-out only, if downstream of the nearby intersection; and right-in only, if upstream of the nearby intersection. Any property so small that this minimum cannot be met will be granted a temporary right-in/right-out connection on the collector or one temporary single direction connection on each of the streets as described above, to be used until an access road has been provided. Lot splits will not be allowed on corner lots that cause the new parcels to be too small to meet the minimum connection separation standards in Table 1, unless the property owner provides an alternative form of access to the new corner parcel. 
(f)  The measurement of distance between connection points along multi-lane median-divided arterials or collectors with restrictive medians will be between connections on the same side as the proposed connection. Existing or approved median openings will be treated as connections on both sides. Streets designed by private parties for multi-lane construction or widening that will be city-maintained arterials or collectors, or roads that are included in the current city CIP and verified by the city manager or designee to be a road that will have a median divider, will be evaluated as such under this provision. 
(g)  Approval of connection locations along multi-lane divided roadways, or along roadways that the city manager or designee has verified will be multi-lane divided roadways, does not guarantee that the connection is permitted a crossover through the median divider. In these instances, access will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the agency(ies) with jurisdiction over the roadway. 
(h)  The requirements of this section do not apply to roads declared by the city council to be controlled access roads with designated access points. Those roads will be treated as set forth below: 
(1)  Controlled access roads. 
a.  On controlled access roads, permanent access points are restricted to locations established and set by an access plan adopted by the council by resolution. The designation of a street as controlled access is desirable when restriction of access is necessary to preserve safety and traffic capacity of the street. Only those access points in the access plan will be approved by the city manager or designee. The city manager or designee is authorized to modify the exact location of approved access points in accordance with the administrative code section regulating controlled access roadways, provided no spacing standards are violated by the modification, and provided no property owner, otherwise entitled to the use of the access point, is deprived of its use absent his written consent to the change of location. 
b.  Applicants for additional permanent access points, turning movements, or median openings beyond those already designated by resolution, must submit a study to the city manager or designee in accordance with the administrative code section regulating controlled access roadways. The city manager or designee will determine consistency with the administrative code and make recommendation accordingly to the council on the appropriate disposition of the request. The council will make final determination of the disposition of the request. 
(2)  Access points for future expressways. If a public need is shown, access points for future expressways may be addressed at the time of expressway design. 
(3)  Controlled or limited access highways. Access points will be determined and the access rights along with the corridor will be purchased at the time of right-of-way acquisition. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-285), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 18-05, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 3-292. - Traffic impact statements. 
    Traffic impact statements shall survey current and background traffic conditions and public transportation in order to identify potential traffic problems posed by the proposed development. Adverse site-related traffic impacts shall be mitigated by the applicant as specified in the traffic mitigation plan (when required by the city manager or designee) and final development order. This may include proportionate fair share per LDC Section 2-141, Proportionate fair share agreements. The developer shall submit a traffic impact statement, providing a comprehensive assessment of the development's impact on the surrounding road system in accordance with the F.A.C. 17-076, which identifies the traffic impact statement guidelines. All traffic impact statements must submit the following: 
(1)  The traffic impact statement shall provide information regarding the development's traffic generation and impacts at the development's access points onto the adjacent street system, inclusive of existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The level of detail required in a traffic statement is based on how the proposed development will effect the adjacent roadway system. 
(2)  The traffic impact statement shall provide information regarding the development's traffic generation and impacts at the development's access points onto the adjacent street system. The level of detail required in a traffic statement is based on how the proposed development will effect the adjacent roadway system. 
(3)  The traffic impact statement must be prepared in accordance with the current edition of the forms, procedures and guidelines provided by the city. The developer or his representative shall assume full occupancy and a reasonable build-out of the development in the preparation of the traffic impact statement. 
(4)  The traffic impact statement must be prepared by qualified professionals in the fields of civil or traffic engineering or transportation planning. 
(5)  Approval of the traffic impact statement by the city manager or designee may be revoked after one year has expired since the date of approval if the assumptions upon which the traffic impact statement was approved are no longer valid. A significant change in the development proposal may result in the previous approval of the traffic impact statement being revoked at any time. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-286), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 17-20, 11-15-2017 ; Ord. No. 18-05, § 1, 5-16-2018 ) 
Sec. 3-293. - Traffic impact mitigation plan. 
(a)  A traffic impact mitigation plan shall be submitted when required by the city manager or designee based on the findings of adverse impact through the traffic impact statement process. The traffic impact mitigation plan shall be based on the approved traffic impact statement and shall identify in detail those on-site and off-site road and intersection improvements necessary to mitigate the proposed development's adverse impacts by maintaining or restoring adopted levels of service on the public road segments providing immediate access to the site, including any collector or arterial to which the adjacent street is tributary. 
(b)  The function of the traffic impact mitigation plan is to: 
(1)  Identify the responsibility for various road improvements falling to the several participants in the development process; 
(2)  Relate the various needed improvements to the occupancy and use of developed land, particularly regarding the relative timing of occupancy and availability of the road improvements; and 
(3)  Clearly identify the parties who will be responsible for the costs of the improvements. 
(c)  It shall be a fundamental policy assumption that road improvements specified by the traffic impact mitigation plan shall be over and above the required improvements to the city comprehensive plan's road network which are to be funded by the roads impact fee. 
(d)  Approval or approval with conditions of the development order shall be contingent on a finding by the city manager or designee that the traffic impact mitigation plan: 
(1)  Is reasonably based on the assumptions and findings embodied in the approved traffic impact statement; 
(2)  Meets or exceeds the minimum actions required to alleviate the adverse impacts on the surrounding or adjacent road network; and 
(3)  Is consistent with all other local policies, particularly the city comprehensive plan pertaining to roads impact fees, and any applicable development agreements. 
(e)  Timely implementation of the traffic impact mitigation plan shall be a condition of the final development order, and no certificate of occupancy or other permit to occupy or use developed land shall be issued until the traffic impact mitigation plan is implemented and improvements are in place in proportion to the demand the development generates. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-287), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-294. - Turn lanes. 
(a)  Access to streets, roads, or accessways will not be permitted unless turn lanes are constructed by the applicant where turning volumes make such improvements necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, or to reduce adverse traffic impacts on the adjacent street system. Turn lanes must be designed in accordance with standards set forth in the city administrative code. An existing development may request a one-time exception wherein only the expansion will be used to calculate the traffic generated by the development for the purpose of determining whether turn lanes are required. After utilization of the one-time exception, the further expansion of a facility will be added to the existing facility for the purpose of calculating traffic generation and the entire development (existing and expansion) will be deemed a new development. 
(b)  Wherever turn lanes are installed, the surface materials of the added lane must match the surface materials of the existing lanes. If the addition of turn lanes requires a lateral shift of the centerline or other lanes, the entire shifted area must be re-surfaced to create matching surfaces throughout. New and replacement pavement markings must be provided. 
(c)  On arterial or collector streets with restrictive medians where an access road is not required by the city, existing parcels with insufficient road frontage to meet the minimum connection spacing required in section 3-291 Table 1 may be required to provide a continuous right-turn lane on the adjacent arterial or collector street. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-288), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-295. - Perimeter streets. 
    Street systems in all developments shall be designed so as to eliminate existing partial width streets wherever possible and to avoid the creation of new ones. Where an existing partial width street is adjacent to a new development, the unimproved portion of the street shall be improved by the developer. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-289), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-296. - Local streets. 
    Local streets shall be designed to discourage excessive speed and through traffic and to accommodate all potential users.

Sec. 3-297. - Access to street required. 
    General requirements for access are as follows: 
(1)  The development must be designed so as not to create remnants and landlocked areas, unless those areas are established as common areas. 
(2)  All development must abut and have access to a public or private street designed, and constructed or improved to meet the standards in section 3-302. Any development order will contain appropriate conditions requiring the street to be constructed or improved, as may be appropriate in order to meet the standards in section 3-302. Direct access for all types of development to arterial and collector streets must be in accordance with the intersection separation requirements specified in this chapter. 
(3)  Any residential development of more than five acres, or any commercial or industrial development of more than ten acres, must provide two or more means of ingress or egress for the development. Additional access points may be needed for continuation of an existing street pattern, to provide access to adjoining properties, or where additional access is needed to provide alternate access for emergency services. Where feasible, these alternate access points should not be onto the same roadway. Access points designated for emergency use only may not be used to meet this requirement. A deviation or variance from the access point (ingress/egress) requirements stated in this subsection must be obtained through the public hearing process. If a variance or deviation from this section is approved, a notice to all future property owners must be recorded by the developer in the public records prior to the issuance of a local development order allowing construction of the access to the development. The notice must articulate the emergency access plan and provide information as to where a copy of this plan may be obtained from the developer or developer's successor. Deviations from this requirement must be approved at a public hearing.

(3)  Maximum controlled water depth. Excavations for water retention or detention permitted under this section may not penetrate through impervious soil or rock layer that prohibits intermingling of various watery strata. The controlled water depth for water retention or detention excavations may not be greater than 12 feet unless the following criteria are met. 
a.  Excavation depth may exceed 12 feet, to a maximum of 20 feet, if the water depth does not penetrate impervious soil or rock layer. For all lakes deeper than 12 feet, a "Deep Lake Management Plan" must be submitted and approved prior to development order issuance. The Deep Lake Management Plan must address long-term management strategies and include, at a minimum, the following: 
1.  A destratification system adequately sized and designed for each lake deeper than 12 feet must be submitted prior to development order issuance. 
2.  Native shade trees, meeting the specifications of section 3-422(c) must be planted around the lake perimeter, calculated at one tree per 100 feet of lake shoreline measured at control elevation. The tree planting is in addition to other required trees and must be coordinated with lake littoral plant requirements. The planting locations proposed to meet the wetland herbaceous plant requirements set forth in section 3-418, and other additional trees, must be graphically detailed as part of the Deep Lake Management Plan. All plants must be grouped or clustered together around the lake perimeter. 
3.  The property owner must record covenants, in a form acceptable to the city attorney or designee, providing that the lake management techniques, including operation of the destratification system specified in the Deep Lake Management Plan will be maintained for the life of the lake. 
4.  A post-construction bathymetric survey, sealed by a professional surveyor and mapper, must be submitted prior to certificate of compliance for all lakes deeper than 12 feet. 
b.  Any water retention or detention pond proposed to be greater than 20 feet in depth must be approved as a planned development rezoning deviation, or as a condition of a zoning special exception. 
(4)  Excavation bank slopes. The design of shorelines of retention and detention areas must be sinuous rather than straight, as described in division 6 of this article. The banks of all excavations permitted under this section must be sloped at a ratio not greater than four horizontal to one vertical from the top of the excavation to a water depth of four feet below the dry season water table. The slopes must be not greater than two horizontal to one vertical thereafter, except where the city manager or designee determines that geologic conditions would permit a stable slope at steeper than a two to one ratio. Excavation bank slopes must comply with the shoreline configuration, slope requirements, and planting requirements for mimicking natural systems as specified in section 3-418. 
(5)  Fencing. A four-foot fence may be required, at the discretion of the city manager or designee, to be placed around excavations for water retention when located less than 100 feet from any property under separate ownership. 
(6)  Test borings. Test borings must be conducted in conformity with section 4-1405(b)(4), when required by the city manager or designee.

Fire protection and public water systems shall be designed by an engineer and constructed in accordance with city, state, and federal standards, including the domestic requirements established by the appropriate state agency and the fire protection requirements established by the Uniform Florida Fire Prevention Code, as they may be amended. 
(b)  Fire flows. The water distribution system shall be capable of delivering fire flows as follows: 
(1)  Requirements for one- and two-family developments are as follows: 
Distance Between Buildings Needed Fire Flow 
(gpm) Over 30 feet 500 0 to 30 feet 750  
Developments not capable of delivering the required fire flow shall provide automatic sprinkler systems in accordance with NFPA #13D most current adopted edition or shall provide an additional source of water for fire protection in accordance with section 3-392. 
(2)  All other building shall calculate required fire flows in accordance with the formula shown in subsection (b)(3) of this section. This formula establishes a base flow from which the degree of hazard and credit for sprinkler protection will result in a final needed fire flow. NFPA #13 most current adopted edition shall be used for the purpose of determining hazard classification. 
Classification Application Light Light Ordinary I and II Ordinary Ordinary III and higher High  
(3)  Fire flow is based on the following formula: 
F = 18 multiplied by C multiplied by A. 
F = Gallons per minute flow at 20 pounds per square inch residual. 
C = Constant based on type of building construction. 
Coefficients based on construction type: 
1.5 = Wood (type VI). 
1.0 = Ordinary (type V). 
0.8 = Noncombustible (types III and IV). 
0.6 = Fire resistive (type I and II). 
A = The square root of the gross floor area (as defined in the state building code, most current adopted edition) of all floors. 
Area of buildings without walls shall be calculated using building area as defined in the 1988 Florida Building Code. 
Fire resistive construction need only be calculated on the three largest successive floors. 
A four-hour fire resistive wall may be used to reduce total square footage of a building providing the wall intersects each successive floor of the building. 
BF = Base flow established from the formula F = 18 C multiplied by A. 
FF = BF multiplied by 0.75 (light hazard occupancy). 
FF = BF multiplied by one (ordinary hazard occupancy). 
FF = BF multiplied by 1.25 (high hazard occupancy). 
If the building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with all state and local codes, the fire flow requirement will be deemed to have been satisfied. 
(4)  A minimum flow in all cases will be 500 gallons per minute with a 20 pounds per square inch residual. 
(5)  In areas that cannot meet a flow of 500 gallons per minute, alternate sources of water may be acceptable, subject to fire chief approval. 
(c)  Water main installation. 
(1)  Water mains for one and two dwelling unit developments shall be no less than eight inches in diameter, and constructed in an external loop connected to intersecting water mains at a maximum distance of 1,500 feet. 
(2)  Water mains for multifamily developments with three to six dwelling units per building and not exceeding two stories in height shall be no less than eight inches in diameter, and constructed in an external loop connected to intersecting water mains at a maximum distance of 1,500 feet. 
(3)  Water mains for multifamily developments composed of buildings with more than six units per building or more than two stories in height, and all commercial areas, shall be no less than ten inches in diameter, and constructed in an external loop system with intersecting water mains installed every 2,000 feet. 
(4)  Water mains for all industrial areas and all hazardous storage areas shall be no less than 12 inches in diameter and constructed in an external loop system with intersecting water mains installed every 2,000 feet. Fire hydrants shall be installed on intersecting water mains. 
(5)  Fire hydrants shall be installed so that the 41/2-inch streamer connection is no less than 18 inches and no more than 24 inches above finished grade. 
(6)  The maximum allowed dead-end water line shall be no longer than one-half the distance required between intersecting water mains. 
(7)  Any water main along an arterial road or considered by the utility company to be a main transmission line shall be sized to accommodate future growth, but in no case, less than specified in this section. A letter of approval from the utility company will be acceptable evidence of conformance with this requirement. 
(8)  Fire hydrants shall be located within ten feet of the curbline of fire lanes, streets, or private streets when installed along such accessways. 
(9)  The applicant may submit a request for an administrative deviation for alternatives to line sizing, dead-end and intersecting water main criteria if they embody sound engineering practices, and are demonstrated by the applicant's professional engineer. 
(d)  Hydrant spacing. 
(1)  Fire hydrant spacing shall be determined using the last available hydrant on the public water system as the PCP. 
(2)  Hydrant spacing for all developments shall be measured along the centerline of the street. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "street" shall include all road frontage, including roadways, drives, avenues, or any other road designation. Also included shall be any private drive designated as required fire department access. 
(3)  Fire hydrants shall be spaced as follows: 
a.  Hydrants for one- to two-dwelling unit developments shall be 800 feet apart as measured along the centerline of the street. 
b.  Hydrants for multifamily developments with three to six dwelling units per building and not exceeding two stories in height shall be 600 feet apart measured along the centerline of the street. 
c.  Hydrants for multifamily developments with more than six dwelling units per building or more than two stories in height, and commercial areas, shall be 400 feet apart as measured along the centerline of the street. 
d.  Hydrants for all industrial and hazardous storage areas, as defined in the Florida Building Code, shall be 300 feet apart as measured along the centerline of the street. 
(4)  Where fire flows are provided by a public water system, on-site fire hydrants shall be provided so that in no case shall there be a fire hydrant located more than 400 feet from all portions of the ground floor of any building. This shall be in addition to any other hydrant spacing requirement. This shall not apply to one- and two-family developments.

Sec. 3-416. - Submittal requirements. 
(a)  Landscape plan required. Prior to the approval of a development order, an applicant whose development is covered by the requirements of this section must submit a landscape plan to be reviewed by staff and the tree advisory board. The landscape plan must be prepared by and bear the seal of a landscape architect registered in the state. The plan must include the narrative and calculations to ensure that the proposed landscaping will be in compliance with requirements of this LDC. However, small projects may qualify for a hardship waiver if the cost of compliance with the landscape architect requirement is disproportionate to the cost of the entire project. This waiver is subject to the sole discretion of the city manager or designee. The landscape plan must be drawn at an appropriate size for review and include, at a minimum, the following items where applicable: 
(1)  Title of project including project owner's name. 
(2)  Preparer's name.

(b)  Irrigation plan required. Prior to the approval of a development order, an applicant whose development is covered by the requirements of this section must submit an irrigation plan. The irrigation plan requirement does not apply to single-family residential lots created by a development order. The conceptual irrigation plan must, at a minimum, indicate: 
(1)  The type of irrigation system proposed. 
(2)  All landscape areas, including parking lot islands, will be adequately sleeved for irrigation. This requirement must be included on the grading/paving plan sheet. 
(3)  Consistent with the provisions of F.S. § 373.62, as may be amended, a rain shut-off device and soil moisture sensor shall be included in the irrigation system and located on the site. 
(4)  The irrigation system will be designed to eliminate the application of water to impervious areas, including roads, drives and other vehicle use areas. 
(5)  The irrigation system will be designed to avoid impacts on existing native vegetation that will be retained on the development site. 
(6)  The irrigation system shall provide for 100 percent overlap of spray areas. 
(7)  "Xeriscape" or "Florida-friendly landscape" irrigation plans may have deviations approved to the irrigation plan, depending on the water conservation measures utilized, and to the extent the irrigation plan conforms with the Florida Yards and Neighborhoods Program, as administered by the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. In addition to such water saving devices, deviations may be approved for temporary irrigation measures to establish an initial "watering-in stage," prior to the removal of such temporary irrigation measures.

Sec. 3-417. - Open space. 
(a)  Open space calculations. All development must contain the minimum percentage of open space as outlined in the following table below: 
Open Space Requirement 
Type of Development Required Open Space as a % of Development Area Residential, non-planned development: Type of dwelling units as defined in chapter 9 located in conventional zoning districts Single-family residence Open space/pervious 
standards. See chapter 4. Duplex on a single lot with a minimum lot size of 7,500 sq. ft. None Two-family attached each on an individual lot with a minimum lot size of 3,750 sq. ft. per unit None All other residential other than planned developments 35% Residential planned development 40% Industrial 10% Other: All other uses including, but not limited to commercial, places of worship, recreational vehicle parks, community facilities, schools (excluding Lee County School District), etc. 20%  
(b)  Indigenous native vegetation. 
(1)  Preservation. 
a.  Large developments, with existing indigenous native vegetation, must provide 50 percent of their open space percentage requirement through the on-site preservation of existing indigenous native vegetation. Refer to section 3-523. A minimum setback of 30 feet is required from any habitable structure. 
b.  If the development area does not contain existing indigenous native vegetation communities, but does contain existing indigenous native trees, then 50 percent of their open space percentage requirement must be met through the on-site preservation of existing native trees consistent with subsections (b)(1)b.1 through 4 of this section. Refer to Appendix A of this chapter. 
1.  Preservation of indigenous tree clusters is preferred over individual tree protection. Reasonable efforts to retain individual trees must be made. It is recognized that site design requirements (e.g., fill) may limit the ability to retain some individual trees, and in that case the city will allow the removal of those trees. 
2.  Sabal palms may be relocated in a horticulturally correct manner and clustered within open space areas. 
3.  Native trees (four-inch caliper dbh or greater) may be relocated to open space areas when proper horticultural methods (e.g., root pruning; use of anti-transpirants) are utilized to ensure the survivability of the trees. 
4.  Effort must be made to preserve heritage trees (live oak, South Florida slash pine, or longleaf pine with minimum 20-inch caliper dbh). If a heritage tree must be removed from a site then a replacement tree with a minimum 20-foot height must be planted within an appropriate open space area. 
(2)  Tree advisory board review. 
a.  The tree advisory board may make recommendations to applicants and staff, concurrent with the zoning process and prior to the issuance of the development order, who may suggest modifications to the master concept plan. The tree advisory board's final recommendation may not take longer than 60 days from the date the matter is placed on their agenda, unless agreed to by the applicant. 
b.  If the review is required as a zoning condition prior to the issuance of the development order, staff may approve administrative deviations to the parking plan or site layout upon input from the tree advisory board. Alternatively, if the staff believes the deviation exceeds the staff's designated authority, the staff may request the city council's concurrence that an administrative deviation is the best practice to promote the preservation of a heritage tree. Any request for city council concurrence will be considered at a regular city council meeting, with regular notice of the agenda (no special advertisement or public notice to parties of record). If city council determines the deviation warrants a public hearing resulting from changes in the parking plan or site layout, the applicant shall file for an amendment to their planned development through chapter 4. 
(3)  Salvaging existing native plants. 
a.  Open space areas must be designed to incorporate as many of the existing large native trees and sabal palms as possible. 
b.  Native trees and sabal palms. Healthy native trees and sabal palms with a caliper of four inches or greater at 41/2 feet above the ground (dbh) may be relocated onsite for credit toward code required landscaping when the trees have been properly prepared for relocation through root pruning or other horticulturally correct methods approved by the city manager or designee. 
(4)  Credits. 
a.  As an incentive to preserve indigenous native upland plant communities in large tracts, a scaled open space credit for single preserve areas will be granted as follows: 
Indigenous Vegetation Credit 
Credit provided Minimum size Minimum width 110% 1/2 acre 50 feet 125% 1 acre 100 feet 150% 3 acres 200 feet  
b.  An additional, maximum ten percent credit will be granted if any of the following vegetation areas are included: 
1.  Rare and unique uplands as defined by the city comprehensive plan. 
2.  Connection to offsite public or private environmental conservation or preserve areas. 
3.  Upland buffers to natural waterbodies 
(5)  Consistent with the provisions of section 3-81, the city manager or designee may permit administrative deviations to reduce the minimum 50 percent indigenous native vegetation requirement within this subsection to a lower percentage, if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed landscape plan will result in a better overall product than what would have been produced under these standards. Existing approved indigenous preserve areas within planned developments are not eligible for administrative deviations. The administrative deviation request must include the unique conditions or circumstances that make the property unusable and unreasonably burdensome. The applicant must provide details of other actions that will be taken to offset the reduction. Offsets to this requirement can only be made through enhancements to the landscape material being planted according to the landscape plan. 
(6)  Setbacks. 
a.  A minimum 30-foot setback from all preserve (wildland) areas is required for buildings and accessory structures for the purposes of fire protection. Buildings and accessory structures located closer than 30 feet from a preserve (wildland) area shall require special mitigation measures as determined by the Bonita Springs Fire Control and Rescue District, in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association ("NFPA"), Standard 1144, "Standard for Protection of Life and Property from Wildfire." 
(c)  Minimum dimensions. 
(1)  The minimum average width of open space areas must be five feet in commercial areas and ten feet in all other areas. 
(2)  The minimum area of open space must be 180 square feet. 
(3)  Indigenous open space areas must have a minimum average width of 20 feet and minimum area of 400 square feet. 
(d)  Use of open space. 
(1)  Open space areas must be landscaped in accordance with this division. 
(2)  The following uses may contribute to the open space requirements; provided the minimum dimensions are met: 
a.  Buffers and landscaped areas in off-street parking areas, except for areas reserved for future parking spaces pursuant to section 4-1729(d). 
b.  Dry detention areas. 
c.  Existing or proposed bodies of water, including stormwater management areas, and areas subject to saltwater inundation, which may be used to offset up to a maximum of 25 percent of the required open space area. 
d.  Active and passive recreation areas such as playgrounds, golf courses, beach frontage, native trails, bikeways, pedestrian ways, tennis courts, swimming pools, and other similar open spaces, as long as not more than 20 percent of the recreational area credited as open space consists of impervious surface. 
e.  Outdoor active and passive public use areas such as plazas, atriums, courtyards, and other similar public spaces may be used to offset up to a maximum of 20 percent of the required open space. 
f.  Archaeological sites or zones that are designated as significant historic resources pursuant to chapter 5 may also be used in open space calculations. 
(e)  Indigenous preserve management plan. A long-term management plan must be submitted that details land management activities to be taken to ecologically manage the indigenous preservation area. This document must be recorded on the deed to ensure future property owners associations, and future owners or assigns are provided clear notice of these long-term land management requirements and commitments. The management plan must provide details of maintaining the biological health of the system. The management plan must include, but is not limited to: native plant maintenance, exotic pest plant control, protected species habitat maintenance, schedule of maintenance activities and allowable uses, and wildfire risk mitigation (which will take into account the flammability of such vegetation).

(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-415), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 06-03, 3-15-2006; Ord. No. 08-07, 3-5-2008; Ord. No. 08-22, 11-5-2008; Ord. No. 11-05, 3-16-2011; Ord. No. 15-28 , § 1, 12-16-2015) 
Sec. 3-418. - Landscape standards. 
(a)  General. Landscaping for all new developments, except community parks, as defined in the city comprehensive plan and roads constructed by a government entity other than CDD Districts, must include, at a minimum, the following number of trees, in addition to the landscaping required for parking and vehicle use areas and buffers. General tree requirements may be reduced through the utilization of larger trees as specified in section 3-422(c)(1)), or through use of an alternative landscape betterment plan (see section 3-421). Existing waterbodies within the development area will not be included in the calculation for general tree requirements. Artificial turf is not an appropriate landscape material. 
(1)  Single-family residence developments that are constructed on individual (single) lots. One tree must be provided per 2,000 square feet of development area, which must include a minimum of two trees per single-family lot installed, as well as removal of all Category I exotic plants, prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
(2)  All other residential developments. All other residential developments must provide one tree per 3,000 square feet of development area. 
(3)  Recreational vehicle developments. One tree must be provided per 3,000 square feet of development area. 
(4)  All other developments. One tree must be provided per each 3,500 square feet of development area. No more than 50 percent of the required trees may be located in the area between the rear lot line and a line created by extending the rear wall of the principal structure (defined as the wall closest to, and running roughly parallel to, the rear lot line) to the side lot lines for lots fronting on a single street. Where lots front on two streets, no more than 50 percent of the required trees may be located in the area between the rear lot line and the line created by extending the rear wall of the principal structure to the side lot line and the street right-of-way line. 
(b)  Building perimeter plantings. All new development in commercial zoning districts and commercial components of planned development districts and DRIs must provide building perimeter plantings equal to ten percent of the proposed building gross ground level floor area. These planting areas must be located abutting all sides of the building, (not including the loading area), except when the side of the building directly abuts a preserve or landscape buffer. The perimeter planting areas must consist of landscape areas, raised planters or planter boxes that are a minimum of five feet wide. These landscape areas must include shrubs and ground cover plants with a minimum of 50 percent coverage of the landscape area at the time of planting. Turfgrass is discouraged and is not to exceed ten percent of the landscape area. Water management areas may not be a part of this five-foot planting area. Pedestrian access ways may cross, and loading areas may be placed in the perimeter planting area but may not be used to meet minimum planting area or open space requirements. 
(1)  An enlarged perimeter landscape area is required in the front of shopping centers and freestanding retail uses development. An area that is at least five percent of the size of the vehicular use area must be developed as green space within the front of shopping centers and retail establishments and be an enlargement to the front building perimeter planting area. However, it is not a requirement that this area directly abut the front of the building. The enlarged perimeter planting areas must consist of landscape areas, raised planters or planter boxes that are a minimum of five feet wide. These enlarged perimeter planting areas must include trees, shrubs and ground cover plants with a minimum of 50 percent coverage of the landscape area at the time of planting. Turfgrass is discouraged and is not to exceed ten percent of the landscape area. Water management areas may not be a part of this enlarged planting area. 
(2)  This five percent green space area may be used to meet open space requirements if they are in compliance with section 3-417(c), but may not be used to reduce the perimeter planting areas on the sides and rear of the building. These areas must be designed for scenic, noncommercial recreation purposes, and be pedestrian-friendly and aesthetically appealing. They may include the following: limited mulch, not to exceed ten percent of the area, decorative plantings, landscaped walkways within the interior of the green space area not used for shopping, fountains, manmade watercourses (but not water retention areas), park benches, site lighting, sculptures, gazebos, and any other similar items. 
(c)  Landscaping of parking and vehicle use areas. The provisions of this section apply to all new off-street parking or other vehicular use areas. Existing landscaping that does not comply with the provisions of this LDC must be brought into conformity, to the maximum extent possible, when: the vehicular use area is altered or expanded except for re-striping or seal-coating of lots/drives, the building square footage is changed, or the structure has been vacant for a period of one year or more and a request for an occupational license to resume business is made. Consistent with the provisions of section 3-81, the city manager or designee may permit administrative deviations where a conflict exists between the application of this division and the requirements for the number of off-street parking spaces or area of off-street loading facilities. 
(1)  Vehicular overhang of landscape areas. The front of a vehicle may overhang any landscaped area a maximum of two feet; provided the landscaped area is protected by motor vehicle wheel stops or curbing. Two feet of such landscaped area or walkway may be part of the required depth of each abutting parking space. Walkways must be designed with a minimum of five feet width that is clear of any vehicle overhang. 
(2)  Internal landscaping. All parking areas must be internally landscaped to provide visual relief and cooling effects and to channelize and define logical areas for pedestrian and vehicular circulation, as follows: 
a.  Trees must be planted or retained in parking areas, including landscaped areas reserved for future parking spaces, to provide for canopy coverage when the trees mature. Trees in parking areas must have an average mature spread of 30 feet or more. At least one tree must be planted or retained for every 250 square feet of required internal planting area, and no parking space may be more than 65 feet from a tree planted in a permeable island, peninsula, or median of ten-foot minimum width. 
b.  Landscaped areas on the parking area perimeter or internal islands must equal or exceed a minimum of ten percent of the total paved surface area. Landscaped areas reserved for future parking spaces pursuant to section 4-1729(d) may not be included in this calculation. 
c.  The minimum average dimension of any required internal landscaped area must be five feet. 
d.  No more than an average of ten parking spaces must occur in an uninterrupted row unless divider medians, as specified in subsection (c)(2)f of this section, are used. Where existing trees are retained in a landscape island the amount of parking spaces in that row may be increased to 15; provided that the 65-foot minimum distance from a shade tree is maintained. 
e.  Each row of parking spaces must be terminated by landscaped islands that measure not less than five feet in width, and not less than 18 feet in length. Curbing is strongly encouraged. If terminal islands are used for required canopy trees, they must be a minimum of ten feet in width. 
f.  Optional divider medians may be used to meet interior landscape requirements. If divider medians are used, they must form a landscaped strip between abutting rows of parking spaces. The minimum width of a divider median must be five feet. One tree must be planted for each 40 linear feet of divider or fraction thereof. Trees in a divider median may be planted singly or in the case of palm trees in clusters. The maximum spacing of trees must be 60 feet. 
g.  All interior landscaped areas not dedicated to trees or to preservation of existing vegetation must be landscaped with grass, ground cover, shrubs, or other approved landscaping materials, and this must be so noted on the landscape plans. Sand, gravel, rock, shell, artificial turf, or pavement are not appropriate landscape materials. 
h.  Light poles must be located outside of all parking islands that contain required trees. Light poles and associated utility boxes (fixtures) may be placed in oversized landscape islands with the landscaping required in this code; however, in the event of a conflict between the required landscaping and the utility fixtures, the utility fixtures shall be altered instead of canopy trees being trimmed and/or removed other than what is permitted within this code. 
(d)  Buffering adjacent property. Buffering and screening applies to all new development, with the exception of roads constructed by a government entity other than a CDD. Existing landscapes that do not comply with the provisions of this section must be brought into conformity to the maximum extent possible when: the vehicular use area is altered or expanded, except for re-striping or seal-coating of lots/drives, the building square footage is increased, or there has been a discontinuance of use for a period of one year or more and a request for an occupational license to resume business is made. 
(1)  General. A buffering area is required along the entire perimeter of the proposed development whenever the proposed development abuts a different use. Ingress and egress will be subtracted from the buffer length requirement so that trees are properly proportioned. The existing use or, where vacant, the permitted use, of the abutting property will determine the type of buffering area required for the proposed development. Buffer areas may not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated street right-of-way or roadway easement, except that buffers may be located within slope easements as long as appropriate planting soil is provided in the slope. 
(2)  Use categories. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this section, development is classified into the following use categories: 
Uses 
SF-R Single-family, duplex or two-family attached situated on individual lots MF-R Residential structures containing three or more dwelling units on a single parcel COM Commercial uses, public facilities, schools (other than Lee County School District), and recreational vehicle parks WOR Places of worship (df) IND Industrial use STP Sewer treatment plant or water treatment plant ROW Public street right-of-way or roadway easement  
(3)  Buffer requirements. The following table provides the required buffer type when a proposed use is abutting an existing use or, in the absence of an existing use, the existing zoning. 
Buffer Requirements

Notes for Buffer Types Table: 
(1)  A solid wall, berm or wall and berm combination, not less than eight feet in height. All trees and shrubs required in the buffer must be placed on the outside of any wall proposed or required. The height of the wall must be measured from the average elevation of the street or streets abutting the property as measured along the centerline of the streets, at the points of intersection of the streets with the side lot lines (as extended) and the midpoint of the lot frontage (see section 4-2172). Walls must be constructed to ensure that historic flow patterns are accommodated and all stormwater from the site is directed to on-site detention/retention areas in accordance with the SFWMD requirements. 
(2)  Hedges must be planted in double staggered rows and be maintained so as to form a 36-inch high (F type buffers must be 48 inches at installation and be maintained at 60 inches high) continuous visual screen within one year after time of planting as indicated by the date of the completion of the development order or phase thereof." 
(3)  Trees within the ROW buffer must be appropriately selected so that in mature form conflicts with site visibility, overhead utilities, lighting and signs are avoided. The clustering of trees and use of palms within the ROW buffer will add design flexibility and reduce conflicts. Palms are limited to 30 percent of the total number of required trees. 
(5)  Public and quasi-public facilities, including, but not limited to, places of worship, parks, utility facilities, government offices, neighborhood recreational facilities, and private schools must provide a type C buffer unless it can be shown that the proposed development will not have an adverse impact on adjacent existing residential uses. 
(6)  If roads, drives, or parking areas are located less than 125 feet from an existing residential subdivision or residential lots, a solid wall or combination berm and solid wall not less than eight feet in height must be constructed not less than 25 feet from the abutting property and landscaped (between the wall and the abutting property) with a minimum of five trees and 18 shrubs per 100 lineal feet. Where residences will be constructed between the road, drive, or parking area and the existing residential subdivision or lots, the wall or wall and berm combination are not required. Uses or activities that generate noise, dust, odor, heat, glare, or other similar impacts, must provide a type C or F buffer unless it can be shown the proposed development will not have a significantly adverse impact on adjacent property. Walls, berms, and buffer plantings must not be placed so they violate the vehicle visibility requirements of section 4-2251. 
(7)  All freestanding parking areas, whether commercial, public, or private, not associated with other development must provide a D type buffer for the right-of-way and C type buffer if they abut single-family residential or multiple-family residential uses or zoning. 
(8)  Use of buffer areas. Required buffers may be used for passive recreation such as pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trails; provided that: 
a.  No required trees or shrubs are eliminated; 
b.  Not more than 20 percent of the width of the buffer is impervious surface; 
c.  The total width of the buffer area is maintained; and 
d.  All other requirements of this chapter are met.

Sec. 3-419. - Efficient irrigation design and maintenance standards. 
(a)  Irrigation systems shall use a smart system using a hydro-zone design to simulate natural rainfall, matching precipitation rates avoiding overwatering and providing efficient (low volume) water usage. 
(b)  Sprinkler and routers for turf areas shall be installed so as to minimize over spray onto paved surfaces, structures, and non-vegetated areas; minimize runoff of irrigation water; and operate at their designed overlap pattern to ensure 100 percent coverage. 
(c)  All required irrigation systems must be designed to eliminate the application of water to impervious areas, including roads, drives and other vehicle areas. Required irrigation must also be designed to avoid adverse impacts on existing native vegetation. 
(d)  All new developments that have required landscaping must be irrigated by the use of an automatic irrigation system with smart controllers set to conserve water. Rain and soil moisture sensors must be installed in all automatic sprinkler systems to override the sprinkler activation mechanism during periods of increased rainfall. Where existing irrigation systems are modified requiring the acquisition of a permit, automatic activation systems and overriding rain and soil moisture sensors must be installed. 
(e)  Maintenance of irrigation system. The developer/owner is responsible for maintenance of the required irrigation consistent with the development order, the provisions of this section and F.S. § 373.62, as may be amended. 
(1)  An irrigation professional responsible for installing or substantially modifying an irrigation system shall provide the city and property owner with a maintenance checklist and recommended schedule, proper irrigation system settings according to the seasons, recommendations for checking technology that inhibits or interrupts operation of the system during periods of insufficient moisture, filter cleaning recommendations, if applicable, and information on the current water restrictions.

Sec. 3-420. - Stormwater ponds. 
    Design standards. Techniques to mimic the function of natural systems in stormwater management ponds are as follows: 
(1)  Shoreline configuration. Shorelines must be sinuous in configuration to provide increased length and diversity of the littoral zone. Sinuous is defined as serpentine, bending in and out, wavy or winding. 
(2)  Plant materials. The following are considered sufficient to mimic the function of natural systems in ponds. 
a.  Shorelines must be sloped or bermed to direct stormwater through pretreatment systems or swales prior to discharge into the pond. 
b.  The minimum required number of native wetland herbaceous plants is one plant per linear foot of lake shoreline as measured at the control elevation water level. 
c.  Native wetland trees or shrubs may be substituted for up to 50 percent of the total number of herbaceous plants required. The native trees and shrubs must meet the following substitution ratios and standards: 
1.  Trees: 
Container Size Minimum Height Herbaceous 
Plants Credit 3 gallon 3 feet 5 10 gallon 6 feet 20  
2.  Shrubs: 
Container Size Minimum Height Herbaceous 
Plants Credit 3 gallon 2 feet 5 10 gallon 4 feet 20  
d.  Plants must be installed in clusters around the lake perimeter. Placement of clusters at the inlet and outfall areas is strongly encouraged. Clusters must contain a minimum of 25 plants within a 50-square-foot area. 
e.  At least four species must be planted. Minimum required herbaceous plant size is a two-inch container, referred to as a liner. Trees and shrubs must meet the minimum standards in section 3-422. 
f.  Sodding or mulching of native wetland plant materials is allowed to establish plantings at the minimum required density in lieu of liners. 
g.  Survival of plant materials. A minimum of 80 percent survivability of plantings at one year is required for herbaceous wetland plants. Wetland trees and shrubs must be maintained per section 3-417. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-418), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 11-05) 
Sec. 3-421. - Alternate landscape betterment plan. 
    Applications pursuant to this division are entitled to demonstrate that the intent of this division can be more effectively accomplished through an alternate landscape betterment plan. The following conditions must be met: 
(1)  The plan may not deviate from the minimum open space requirements of section 3-417. 
(2)  The plan must be labeled as an alternate landscape betterment plan, and delineate, identify and locate all changes to the requirements of this division. 
(3)  No less than 75 percent of the trees installed must be native species. 
(4)  If larger trees are substituted to reduce the minimum number of general trees required, all substituted trees must be no less than five inches in diameter at 12 inches above the ground or less than 12 feet in height at the time of planting. In no case may general trees be reduced in number by more than 50 percent of the requirement. The actual ratio of the number of general trees reduced from the requirement will be dependent upon demonstration that the plan is a betterment based on: 
a.  The proposed size and number of substituted trees; 
b.  Similarity to native vegetation on site or in the immediate vicinity; 
c.  Appropriate plant grouping for water needs; and 
d.  The amount of immediate increase in site canopy. 
(5)  The plan must designate the botanical name (genus and species) and location of all plant material to be installed. 
(6)  The proposed alternate landscape betterment plan may not be approved if the city manager or designee determines that the intent of the minimum requirements of these provisions is not being exceeded. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-419), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 11-05) 
Sec. 3-422. - Plant material standards. 
(a)  Quality. Plant materials used to meet the requirements of this division must meet the standards for Florida No. 1 or better, as set out in Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, Parts I and II, Department of Agriculture, State of Florida (as amended). Root ball sizes on all transplanted plant materials must also meet state standards. 
(b)  Native varieties. At least 75 percent of the trees and 50 percent of the shrubs used to fulfill these requirements must be native Florida species. 
(c)  Trees and palms. 
(1)  Code-required trees, at the time of installation, must be a minimum of ten feet in height, have a two-inch caliper 12 inches above the ground and a four-foot spread. Palms must have a minimum of eight feet of clear trunk at planting. Palms may be used in place of trees at the rate of one palm for one tree for buffer and general tree requirements. Palms with a canopy less than 20 feet shall be clustered in groups in a minimum of three. Palms may only be used to meet 30 percent of the code-required trees. Small trees such as dahoon hollies that have an average mature spread or crown less than 20 feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a 20-foot crown spread. Trees adjacent to walkways, bike paths and rights-of-way must be maintained with eight feet of clear trunk. Palms must be properly staked at installation. 
(2)  Larger trees substituted to reduce the minimum number of general trees, without the use of an alternative landscape betterment plan, must be no less than four inches in diameter at 12 inches above the ground, and no less than 16 feet in height at the time of planting. The general tree requirement cannot be reduced in number by more than 50 percent. 
(d)  Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs must be a minimum of 20 inches (48 inches for type F buffers) in height, above the on-site adjacent pavement or parking surface required to be buffered and/or screened, when measured at time of planting. They must be a minimum three-gallon container size and be spaced 18 to 36 inches on center. They must be at least 36 inches (60 inches for type F buffers) in height within 12 months of the time of planting and maintained in perpetuity at a height of no less than 36 inches (60 inches for type F buffers) above the adjacent pavement required to be buffered and/or screened, except for visibility at intersections and where pedestrian access is provided. Required hedges must be planted in double staggered rows and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual screen within a minimum of one year after the time of planting. 
(e)  Mulch requirements. A two-inch minimum layer, after watering-in, of mulch or other recycled materials must be placed and maintained around all newly installed trees, shrubs, and ground cover plantings. Each tree must have a ring of mulch no less than 24 inches beyond its trunk in all directions. The use of cypress mulch is strongly discouraged. 
(f)  Invasive exotics. The following highly invasive exotic plants must be removed from the development area. Methods to remove and control invasive exotic plants must be included on the development order plans. A statement must also be included on the development order that the development area will be maintained free from invasive exotic plants in perpetuity. For purposes of this subsection, invasive exotic plants include: 
Species to be Removed 
Common name Scientific name Melaleuca, paper tree Melaleuca quinquenervia Brazilian pepper, Florida holly Schinus terebinthifolius Australian pines All Casuarina species Earleaf acacia Acacia auriculiformis Downy rosemyrtle Rhodomyrtus tomentosus Tropical soda apple Solanum viarum Winged yam Dioscorea alata Air potato Dioscorea bulbifera Lantana Lantana camara Seaside mahoe Hibiscus tiliaceus Scaevola Beach naupaka Scaevola taccada Guinea grass Panicum maximum Woman's tongue Albizia lebbeck Bishopwood Bischofia javanica Carrotwood Cupianopsis anacardioides Java plum Syzygium cumini Norfolk Island Pine* Araucaria heterophylla Rosary pea Abrus precatorius Lead Tree Leucaena leucocephala Ceasarweed Urena lobata  
*The Property Maintenance Code, Ordinance No. 11-01, as amended, requires exotic removal on vacant and occupied lands. It is not the intent of the inclusion of Norfolk Island Pine to this list to require removal on existing property that is not undergoing development. 
(g)  Prohibited species. The following species of exotic plants are considered invasive and may not be used to fulfill any requirements of this division: 
Prohibited Species List 
Common name Scientific name Rosewood Dalbergia sissoo Murray red gum Eucalyptus camaldulensis Benjamin fig Ficus benjamina Cuban laurel Ficus microcarpa Rose apple Syzygium jambos Cork tree Thespesia populnea Wedelia Wedelia trilobata Chinese tallow Sapium sebiferum Strawberry guava Psidium cattleianum Common guava Psidium guajava Glossy privet Ligustrum lucidum Chinese ligustrum Ligustrum sinense Golden raintree Koelreuteria elegans Day Jessamine Cestrum diurnum Chinaberry Melia azederach Surinam cherry Eugenia uniflora  
(h)  Credits. 
(1)  Except for prohibited species as listed above, every consideration must be given to retaining as much of the existing plant material as possible. 
(2)  Each existing indigenous native tree preserved in place not otherwise included within a credited preserve area, which has a trunk diameter of four inches or greater measured at 41/2 feet above the ground (dbh) will receive a credit of five trees against the general landscape requirements. Native palms preserved in place that are ten feet or greater from ground level to base of fronds, will receive a credit of three trees. Existing sabal palms, identified on the development order plans that are relocated onsite, will be given a two tree credit. Credits for existing trees outside of the parking areas may not be used to reduce the required parking canopy trees in parking or vehicle use areas. Existing native trees in buffers may be used for credit provided they occur within the required 100-foot buffer segment. Credits will apply only when the trees are labeled as protected-credit trees. If the protected-credit trees die within three years from the development order certificate of compliance, they must be replaced by the number of credit trees taken. 
(3)  Credits will apply where the preserved tree is in a barricaded area at least two-thirds the radius of the crown spread of the tree measured from the trunk center. In no case may this area radius be less than 21/2 feet. For indigenous native pine trees, the barricaded area may be no less than the full crown spread of the tree, unless other measures such as tie-walls or special slope treatment are constructed for additional protection. Prior to the land clearing stage of development, the owner, developer, or agent must erect protective barriers that are at minimum made of one-inch by one-inch lumber or approved alternative barricading material. For all native, indigenous open space areas, including shrubs and ground cover, barricades must be erected around the perimeter of the vegetation. The owner, developer, or agent may not cause or permit the movement of equipment or the storage of equipment, material, debris, or fill to be placed within the required protective barrier. The protected trees must remain alive and healthy at the end of the construction in order for this credit to apply. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-420), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 11-05; Ord. No. 12-11, § 1(3-420), 8-1-2012) 
Sec. 3-423. - Plant installation and maintenance standards. 
(a)  Installation. 
(1)  Plant materials must be installed in soil conditions that are conducive to the proper growth of the plant material. Limerock located within planting areas must be removed and replaced with native or growing quality soil before planting. 
(2)  A plant's growth habit must be considered in advance of conflicts that might be created (e.g., views, signage, overhead power lines, lighting, circulation). Trees may not be placed where they interfere with site drainage, subsurface utilities, or overhead utility lines, or where they will require frequent pruning in order to avoid interference with overhead power lines. Landscape designers must consult FP&L's guidelines for planting in and around power lines. 
(3)  All landscape materials must be installed in a recognized horticulturally correct manner. At a minimum, the following installation requirements must be met: 
a.  A minimum of 75 percent of plantings must utilize Florida-friendly design standards "right plant right place" practices. 
b.  All landscape areas must be mulched unless vegetative cover is already established. 
c.  Trees and shrubs used in buffers must be planted in a minimum width area equal to one-half the required width of the buffer. However, in no case may the planting area be less than five feet in width. 
d.  All landscaped areas must be provided protection from encroachment by any type of vehicle. 
e.  All required plants used in buffers and landscaping must be installed using xeriscape principles. Xeriscape principles include water conservation through drought-tolerant landscaping, the use of appropriate plant material, mulching, and the reduction of turf areas. 
f.  Utility, power, or drainage easements may overlap required buffers; however, no required trees or shrub may be located in any utility, power, or street easement or right-of-way. To avoid conflicts with overhead utility lines, only small trees, less than 20 feet in height at maturity, may be used directly adjacent to an overhead line. 
g.  Safe sight distance triangles at intersections and vehicle connections. Where an access way intersects a right-of-way or when a property abuts the intersection of two or more rights-of-way, a minimum safe sight distance triangular area must be established. Within this area, vegetation must be planted and maintained in a way that provides unobstructed visibility at a level between 30 inches and eight feet above the crown of the adjacent roadway. Landscaping must be located in accordance with the roadside recovery area provisions of the state department of transportation's Manual of Uniform Minimum Standards for Design, Construction, and Maintenance of Streets and Highways (FDOT Green Book) where appropriate. 
(b)  Maintenance of landscaping. The owner is responsible for maintaining the required landscaping consistent with the provisions in the approved development order, in a healthy and vigorous condition at all times. Tree and palm staking must be removed within 12 months after installation. All landscapes must be kept free of refuse, debris, disease, pests, and weeds. Ongoing maintenance to prohibit the establishment of prohibited invasive exotic species is required. As a condition of permitting, community development will reinspect the required landscaping which is required after 12 months from the date the permit is finalized. Canopy trees are required to grow and form a 30-foot diameter or greater spread. Canopy trees are expected to grow three or more feet in diameter per year. Canopy trees that do not form the required 30-foot or greater spread within eight years of installation may be required to be replaced if the tree(s) are in neglect, demonstrate poor form, a lack of adequate irrigation, are of poor soil quality, or show signs of fertilizer deficiencies. As a condition of maintenance, any unpermitted removal of mature landscape trees will require tree replacement on an inch-per-inch basis (dbh) measured at 4.5 feet above grade. 
(c)  Pruning. Vegetation required by this code may only be pruned to promote healthy, uniform, natural growth of the vegetation (except where necessary to promote health, safety, and welfare) and be in accordance with "Pruning Standards," as revised, of the National Arborist Association. Trees must not be severely pruned to permanently maintain growth at a reduced height or spread. Pruning must not interfere with the design intent of the original installation. Severely pruned trees must be replaced by the property owner. A plant's growth habit must be considered in advance of conflicts which might arise (i.e., views, signage, overhead power lines, lighting, circulation, sidewalks, buildings, and similar conflicts). 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-421), 1-19-2005; Ord. No. 15-28 , § 1, 12-16-2015) 
Sec. 3-424. - Landscape certificate of compliance. 
    The landscape architect must inspect and certify that all open space area, landscaping, and the irrigation system are in substantial compliance with the landscape and irrigation plans approved as part of the development order. An as-built landscape plan highlighting any changes to the approved plans must be included with the certification. Any changes to an alternative landscape betterment plan must be approved as a minor change to the development order. The general certificate of compliance procedure outlined in section 3-193 is applicable. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-422), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-425. - Restoration standards for native vegetation removed without approval. 
    A restoration plan based on the minimum standards set out in this division will be required if indigenous native vegetation has been removed without permit or approval. Restoration plantings for vegetation other than trees must be nursery grown, containerized, and planted at no less than three feet on center. The number of replacement plantings will be computed by the square footage of the area destroyed. All other restoration criteria as set forth in chapter 7, article VIII, pertaining to tree protection, will also apply. Restoration plantings for indigenous native trees must be in compliance with the standards set forth in chapter 7, article VIII. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-423), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-426. - Landscaping standards for large-scale retail establishments. 
(a)  Applicability. The following requirements apply to large-scale retail establishments as defined in LDC chapter 4 and are in addition to the landscape requirements set forth in section 3-416. 
(b)  Building perimeter plantings. Plantings required in accordance with subsection 3-416(b) must be provided along all sides of the building, including the rear of the building. Loading areas are addressed in subsection 43-426(e). 
(c)  Buffer requirements. The type "D" buffer required between commercial uses and rights-of-way may be modified where the proposed building setback is within 25 feet of the right-of-way through an alternate landscape betterment plan in accordance with section 3-419. This is not intended to allow for a reduction in general tree requirements or building perimeter tree planting requirements. 
    Where establishments regulated under this section are adjacent to residentially zoned or residentially developed properties, a type "C" perimeter buffer must be provided to screen the residential use. The required solid wall must utilize materials similar in color, module and texture to those utilized for the principal building. The wall must be setback 25 feet from the property line with the required landscaping planted on the residential side of the wall. 
(d)  Internal landscaping. The following must be provided in developments containing large-scale retail establishments. 
(1)  Trees must be planted or retained in accordance with LDC section 3-423 in parking areas, including landscaped areas reserved for future parking spaces, to provide for canopy coverage when trees mature. At least one canopy tree must be planted or retained for every 150 square feet of required internal planting areas, and no parking space may be more than 50 feet from a canopy tree planted in a permeable island or median. 
(2)  Landscaped areas must equal or exceed a minimum of 20 percent of the total paved surface area within the site. Landscaped areas reserved for future parking spaces pursuant to subsection 4-1729(d) may not be included in this calculation. 
(3)  The minimum average dimension of any required internal landscaped area is ten feet, with the exception of divider medians, which must be designed in accordance with subsection (4) below. 
(4)  Each row of parking spaces must be terminated by landscaped islands, or terminal islands, not less than ten feet in width and not less than 18 feet length, as measured from the outside edge of the curb. Curbing is required. Each terminal island will contain a minimum of one canopy tree. 
(5)  A minimum of one divider median is required for every eight rows of parking spaces. The divider median must align with the main entrance to the large-scale retail establishment(s), and provide a minimum five-foot wide sidewalk and a minimum ten-foot wide planting area, as measured from the outside edge of the curb. The planting area may be divided on each side of the sidewalk, so long as neither side is less than five feet wide. Where this option is utilized root barriers and smaller general trees must be utilized, such as palm trees to mitigate conflicts with the sidewalks. General trees must be planted at a maximum spacing of 30 feet on center, in addition to ground cover, shrubs, or other approved landscaping materials. If shrubs or hedgerows are utilized, a break in vegetation must be provided every ten linear feet to provide pedestrian access to the sidewalk. Public trash receptacles must be provided on each divider median. These shall be in the same, or complimentary architectural style to the main structure. Curbing is required. Pedestrian-scale lighting must be provided within the divider median(s) and shall not exceed a maximum height of 15 feet. See figure 4. 
(6)  All exterior mechanical equipment, refuse storage and containers, and above ground storage tanks shall be located and screened from public roadways and private properties in a manner which is compatible with the design of the project. 
(7)  All portions of a parking lot not used for buildings, future buildings, parking, accessory uses, and proposed landscaped areas shall be retained in a predeveloped state, resodded or approved ground cover to ensure the site is maintained in a safe and dust-free manner. 

(e)  Loading areas must be screened by a ten-foot wide type "B" buffer with a combination 12-foot wall berm. The required solid wall must utilize materials similar in color, module and texture to those utilized for the building. The required landscaping must be planted on the exterior side of the wall facing the property line(s) and/or abutting property(ies). 
(f)  Temporary cart storage in the parking area must be screened by a landscaped island, not less than four feet in width, and planted and maintained permanently with a 36-inch double row hedge. The plantings are required on the side of the cart storage area that faces the adjacent street frontage. Alternatively, the cart storage may be provided in a decorative corral that is consistent with and complimentary to the principle building style. The decorative corral is subject to architectural review by the city at the time of local development order review. 
(Ord. No. 14-18 , § 1, 7-2-2014; Ord. No. 14-025 , § 1, 10-15-2014)

DIVISION 8. - PROTECTION OF HABITAT 

Sec. 3-454. - Purpose of division. 
    The purpose of this division is to provide criteria, guidelines, and requirements to protect listed animal and plant species, which inhabit the city by safeguarding the habitat in which these species are found from the impacts associated with land development. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-471), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-455. - Development application requirements. 
(a)  A survey must accompany all planned development rezoning applications and all development order applications where the Florida Land Use, Cover and Forms Classification System codes for the property indicate a possible presence of a city listed species, except as set forth in subsection (c) of this section. The survey must be prepared by using survey methods which are set forth in the administrative code, except that an alternative method may be approved by the city manager or designee. Such survey must include the city listed species presence (sightings, signs, tracks, trails, nests, evidence of feeding, etc.); population estimates; and occupied habitat boundaries. A map and narrative must describe the methodology as applied and the findings. The mapped information must be at the same scale as the development order or zoning application plans and an aerial map at a scale of one inch is less than or equal to 400 feet. Approved species surveys are valid for five years from the date of approval. If the subject parcel has significantly altered the habitat, the city manager or designee may, in their discretion, determine a partial or complete resurvey is sufficient. 
(b)  A management plan may be submitted with any planned development rezoning applications. A management plan meeting the requirements of section 3-456 will be required for all development order applications if listed species are found on the property, except as set forth in subsection (d) of this section. The management plan is subject to final approval by the city manager or designee. 
(c)  Surveys and management plans are not required for small developments. However, if the property is rezoned or if the master concept plan has been vacated, a species survey and management plan will be required. The city manager or designee may waive survey and management plan requirements if the city manager or designee deems that prior surveys and management plans are adequate. 
(d)  For development order applications, submittal items that are common to both the species survey and the management plan can be provided in a single integrated report. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-473), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-456. - Management plan. 
(a)  Components of plan. The management plan required under this division shall include: 
(1)  A one inch equals 200 feet aerial map and a map at the scale of the development order drawings or zoning site plan drawing to include the following: 
a.  Habitat classification depicted by using the Florida Land Use, Cover and Forms Classification System; 
b.  Location of individuals, nest sites, dens, burrows, feeding locations, roosting and perching areas, and trails, as appropriate; 
c.  Areas to be preserved, including habitat and buffers; 
(2)  Recommended management activities; and 
(3)  An action plan with specific implementation activities, schedules, and assignment of responsibilities. 
(b)  Occupied habitat buffer areas established. Occupied habitat buffer areas must be established for an occupied habitat and must extend at a distance appropriate for the listed species as set forth in section 3-537 except where off-site mitigation is permitted in accordance with section 3-457. In the event the game commission has already established the size and dimensions of an occupied habitat buffer area, those boundaries will supersede the distances shown in section 3-537. 
(c)  Development and occupied habitat buffer areas. The occupied habitat buffer area must remain free of development, except for development which will not degrade species existing on the site as determined by the city manager or designee. Occupied habitat buffer areas may be impacted by development if off-site mitigation is utilized in accordance with section 3-457. These buffer areas must be identified on all associated applications and plats where applicable. Buffer areas may not be divided by lot lines unless the city manager or designee determines that the division of these buffer areas by lot lines is consistent with the protected species management plan. A conservation easement or similar property interest must be granted to the city for the preserved property as a condition of the development order approval or final plat approval, unless the city manager or designee determines it would not be logistically or economically feasible for the city to maintain the easement. Encroachments into occupied habitat and habitat buffer are permissible only after the incentives set forth in subsection (e) of this section have been exhausted or off-site mitigation is permitted in accordance with section 3-457. 
(d)  Conservation easements. If adjacent parcels include conservation easements or other public interest in the land, effort shall be made to connect the easements. 
(e)  Incentives. The city will allow certain incentives in return for the preservation of occupied habitat areas. This incentive system will only apply to those areas to which other incentives have not been utilized and which are not preserved under chapter 7, article VII, pertaining to wetlands protection. Occupied habitat buffer area incentives are as follows: 
(1)  Required occupied habitat buffer areas may be used to fulfill any applicable minimum open space requirements at a ratio of one unit habitat and habitat buffer to 1.5 unit required open space (1:1.5). In no event will this credit be interpreted to reduce any required occupied habitat buffer area. 
(2)  Those single-family developments which consist solely of conventional single-family dwelling units on lots of no less then 6,500 square feet and do not have an open space requirement will be exempt from division 6 of this article, pertaining to open space, buffering and landscaping, except for the minimum buffer requirements, so long as the applicant preserves occupied habitat buffer areas consisting of no less than ten percent of the development area. 
(3)  To the extent that occupied habitat buffer areas exceed applicable minimum open space requirements after the use of the above-described ratio, or as in subsection (e)(2) of this section exceed ten percent of the development area, the city must either allow encroachment into the occupied habitat or permit a credit against park impact fees. The credit against the impact fees may not exceed the appraised value of the preserved land. The appraisal must be based on the value of the property prior to the issuance of the development order that includes the occupied habitat buffer area and on the average of the two appraisals approved by the city manager or designee. The credit will be approved upon the grant of the conservation easement. 
(f)  Consideration of game commission guidelines for listed species. In cases where guidelines have been prepared by the game commission for a listed species, those guidelines must be considered in the preparation of the management plan. 
(g)  When determination made without game commission expertise. If the game commission fails to review any plan in conjunction with city staff's allotted time schedules, determinations will be made without the benefit of game commission expertise. 
(h)  Responsibility for implementation of management plan; monitoring report review. The applicant or his successor in interest is responsible for all aspects of the implementation of the management plan. A monitoring report as to the condition of the habitat and management techniques applied to the habitat must be submitted to the city manager or designee for review on an annual basis from the date that the development order is issued for five consecutive years. 
(i)  Management plan finalization. The management plan must be finalized prior to issuance of the development order. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-474), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-457. - Off-site mitigation. 
(a)  Off-site mitigation is permitted in lieu of the preservation of occupied habitat buffer areas as required in section 3-454(b) to the extent consistent with the requirements of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the game commission. 
(b)  Before development order approval, the applicant must obtain and submit appropriate permits for off-site mitigation. 
(c)  A permanent management commitment for the relocation recipient site which is compatible with long-term protected species viability must be ensured by either filing conservation easements for sites under F.S. § 704.06 or other formal commitments enforceable by the city. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-457), 1-19-2005)

Sec. 3-489. - Building design standards. 
(a)  Intent. 
(1)  General. The purpose of this section of the Code is to provide guidelines to promote visually pleasing and environmentally friendly development consistent with sound principles of urban design in the city, in a manner that safeguards the health, safety and welfare of the city's citizens and visitors. 
(2)  Large buildings. This section additionally intends to break up the monolithic appearance of structures having a footprint of 40,000 square feet or more and present a more human scale of architecture to the public right-of-way and adjacent properties. Because these buildings house a variety of functions that can be accommodated in a variety of spatial types, they can be designed to express these functions in a manner that has the appearance of a group of buildings of varying scale and size. Please refer to section 3-497 for additional standards for large-scale retail establishments. 
(3)  Buildings under 40,000 square feet and designed as a single story structure shall be aesthetically designed to appear as a single story structure. To accomplish this, building envelopes shall have a maximum eave height of 16 feet and shall be expressed as single story elements in the architectural form of the building along the building edge or edges. 
(b)  Facade standards. All facades of a building shall be designed with consistent architectural style, detail, and trim features, as set forth below: 
(1)  A primary facade is one that is in public view and faces or abuts a public or private street, residences, entry courtyard or right-of-way. A minimum of two facades will be considered primary facades, when more than two facades of a building have frontage on a street, entry courtyard, right-of-way, or property that is visible from property zoned or used as residential. The visibility requirement for primary facades does not extend to vacant nonresidentially zoned property that permits residential use. All other facades will be considered secondary facades. 
(2)  The term "visible", as pertains to overhead doors located on a facade facing property zoned or used as residential, shall be defined as able to be see it from plain view with ordinary eyesight at: 
a.  The location: 
1.  If a single-family home development, the nearest property line of the closest existing dwelling unit (or proposed dwelling unit); 
2.  If a multifamily development, the nearest building facade (or proposed building facade); or 
b.  The height: 
1.  If a proposed residential development, a height of six feet; 
2.  If a vacant multifamily residential development, a height equal to 80 percent of the allowable height. 
(c)  Primary facade standards. 
(1)  Building entrance. Buildings located along a public or private street or pedestrian right-of-way shall be designed with an entrance to the building or an entry courtyard facing or abutting the street or pedestrian right-of-way. 
(2)  Design features. The design of the primary facades shall include, at a minimum, two of the following design features: 
a.  Glazing. 
1.  Glazing covering at a minimum 30 percent of the primary facade area, consisting of window and glazed door openings, unless a lower percentage is approved in accordance with section 3-488, or where a lower percentage is permitted for specific building types in accordance with section 3-490. 
2.  In the alternative, up to 30 percent of the required glazing area may be covered with a trellis in lieu of glazing. 
b.  Projected, or recessed covered public entry providing a minimum horizontal dimension of eight feet, and a minimum area of 128 square feet. 
c.  Covered walkway, or arcade (excluding canvas type). The structure shall be permanent, and its design shall relate to the principal structure. The minimum width shall be eight feet, with a total length measuring 60 percent of the length of the associated facade. 
(3)  Mixed use buildings. Each element must be addressed to the standards of the applicable design section if it has more than one form or function, e.g., parking under multi-residential or commercial. 
(d)  Facade/wall height transition. 
(1)  Purpose and intent. The intent of this section is to ensure that the proposed buildings relate in mass and scale to the immediate streetscape and the adjacent built environment. 
(2)  Applicability. Buildings that are more than the height of any existing conforming land use (i.e., what is permitted under the current zoning or comprehensive plan, whatever is stricter, but not the existing structure) shall provide transitional massing elements to transition between the existing land uses of lower height and the proposed development. 
(3)  Design standards. 
a.  Transitional massing elements can be not more than 100 percent taller than the average height of the adjacent building, but no more than 30 feet, and no less than ten feet above the existing grade. However, when adjacent buildings are nonconforming in terms of height characteristics, the height of the new building shall be allowed to meet current zoning district requirements. 
b.  No less than 60 percent of the length of the facade, which is in part or whole within the 150 feet of an existing building, shall incorporate any combination of the following transitional massing elements: 
1.  Wall plane changes. 
2.  Roofs. 
3.  Canopies. 
4.  Colonnades. 
5.  Balconies. 
6.  Other similar architectural features. 

(e)  Variation in massing. A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Changes in mass shall be related to entrances, the integral structure and the organization of interior spaces and activities, and not merely for cosmetic effect. False fronts are prohibited. All facades, excluding courtyard area, shall be designed to employ the following design treatments. 
(1)  Projections and recesses. 
a.  For building footprints larger than 40,000 square feet, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any facade, at any point, shall be 150 linear feet. Projections and recesses shall have a minimum depth of 12 feet. Refer to section 3-497 for additional standards for large-scale retail establishments. 
b.  For building footprints between 20,000 and 39,999 square feet, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any facade, at any point, shall be 125 linear feet. Projections and recesses shall have a minimum depth of eight feet. 
c.  For building footprints between 10,000 and 19,999 square feet, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any facade, at any point, shall be 100 linear feet. Projections and recesses shall have a minimum depth of six feet. 
d.  For building footprints between 5,000 and 9,999 square feet, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any facade, at any point, shall be 65 linear feet. Projections and recesses shall have a minimum depth of four feet. 
e.  For building footprints less than 5,000 square feet, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any facade, at any point, shall be 50 linear feet. Projections and recesses shall have a minimum depth of three feet, and a minimum total width of 20 percent of the facade length. 
f.  If a building has a projection or recesses of 40 feet or more, each is considered a separate facade, and shall meet the requirements for wall plane changes. 
(f)  Project standards. 
(1)  Architectural design standards. Design style chosen shall be applicable on all facades of the building. Note: Additional characteristics (architectural language) are highly encouraged. Primary and secondary facade(s), as determined in accordance with this section, must provide the required architectural features as set forth below. Please refer to sections 3-490(f) and (g) for alternative architectural standards for warehousing/distribution and industrial/factory building types. 
a.  Old Florida. 
1.  Required architectural features (primary facade(s)):

2.  If a multifamily development, the nearest building facade (or proposed building facade); and 
b.  Height: for both a proposed and existing residential development, a height of six feet. 
(3)  For master planned commercial parks with industrial zoning (IPD/CPD/MPD), internal roads/driveways shall not be considered "private roads" under this section, and any visibility from these internal roads/driveways shall not require additional shielding. 
(b)  Self-storage facilities. The intent of these standards is to provide prototype design options while ensuring attractive streetscapes and viewsheds along public roadways, compatibility between self-storage facilities and adjacent structures due to the size and scale associated with these building types, and appropriate transitions between these uses and adjacent neighborhoods. 
(1)  Minimum design standards . The following minimum standards apply to all self-storage facilities, including single-story and multi-story facilities: 
a.  For the purposes of this subsection, a primary facade is one that is in public view and faces or abuts a public or private street, right-of-way, or residentially zoned property. There shall be no limit to the maximum number of primary facades. For the purposes of this section, visible from a residentially zoned property shall include views of the upper stories of multi-story storage facilities and the roof. 
b.  Overhead doors, drop-off locations, service doors, dumpsters and/or loading docks. The requirements of section 3-489(h), overhead doors, drop-off locations, service doors, dumpsters and/or loading docks, is superseded as follows: overhead doors, drop-off locations, service doors, dumpsters and/or loading docks shall not be visible from any public or private street, or from any residentially zoned property. 
c.  Screen walls. When a wall is proposed to screen the facility, it shall be constructed of material similar to and complementary to the primary building material and architecture. Long expanse of wall surface shall be broken into sections no longer than 50 feet, and designed to avoid monotony by use of architectural elements such as pilasters with a minimum depth of four inches. 
d.  Window standards. Windows shall not be false or applied. If the window openings are into the storage area, opaque glass shall be used. 
e.  Glazing . At minimum, primary facades for the first floor or ground level shall include glazing, covering at a minimum 30 percent of the facade area. Upper floors shall include glazing covering a minimum of 20 percent of the facade area. The requirements of section 3-489(j)(1), blank wall areas, shall apply to all facades. 
f.  Variation in massing. A single, large, dominant building mass shall be mitigated through the provision of projections and recesses along all facades. All facades, excluding courtyard area, shall be designed to employ the following design treatments. No facade shall exceed 250 feet in length. 
1.  For building footprints larger than 40,000 square feet, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any facade, at any point, shall be 150 linear feet. Projections and recesses shall have a minimum depth of five feet. 
2.  For building footprints between 20,000 and 39,999 square feet, a maximum length, or uninterrupted curve of any facade, at any point, shall be 125 linear feet. Projections and recesses shall have a minimum depth of three feet. 
g.  Roof design. Buildings shall have an appropriate and fully integrated rooftop architectural treatment which screens all mechanical equipment, stairs, and elevator towers from adjacent streets (both public and private) and residentially zoned property. All rooftop equipment must be completely screened from view at a minimum distance of 600 feet. False fronts, faux roofs, or two-dimensional rooflines are prohibited. Rooftops will be treated as part of the building elevation. The minimum roof slope shall be a 4:12 ratio for double slopes, and 3:12 ratio for single slope. A minimum roof slope of one-half-inch per foot is permitted for self-storage buildings utilizing the modern/contemporary architectural design standards set forth in subsection (2) below, and where the design conceals the roof line through application of walls, or other architectural features. If parapets are used, the end of the parapet must wrap corners for a minimum distance of 25 percent of the length of the facade, and any facade, measured from the corner. The parapet height and width shall be proportional to the overall height and width of the building. 
h.  Building perimeter plantings . Foundation planting areas shall be a minimum of 30 percent of the ground level building area. These planting areas must be located abutting all sides of the building, including the side of the building that abuts a landscape buffer. Trees and palms shall be provided at a rate of one tree per 400 square feet of required foundation planting area and planted at a minimum height of 12 feet. Where facades are uninterrupted by projections, recesses or architectural features for a length of 50 feet or more, trees must be planted in minimum groupings of three trees, spaced 20 feet apart, and planted at a minimum height of 14 feet. 
(2)  Architectural design standards . Structures shall reflect styles and materials that are similar and/or complimentary to the design of surrounding structures and developments, or at the city's discretion, must demonstrate architectural techniques that provide for an aesthetically compatible transition between adjacent structures, both internal and external to the project.

Sec. 3-494. - Signs. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. Signs are intended to be designed to complement rather than detract from the visual impact of a commercial development by utilizing design elements consistent with those employed in the structure's architecture and by minimizing conflicts with on-site landscaping areas and vehicular use areas. 
(b)  Development standards. In addition to the provisions set forth in chapter 6, the following requirements apply: 
(1)  Unified sign plan. Where multiple on-premises signs are proposed for a single site or development, or in the case of a shopping center or other multiple-occupancy complex including out-parcels under unified control with the main development, a unified sign plan must be employed. An application for a development order (or a building permit if a development order is not required) must be accompanied by a graphic and narrative representation of the unified sign plan to be utilized on the site. The unified sign plan may be amended and resubmitted for approval to reflect style changes or changing tenant needs. Design elements which must be addressed (in both graphic and narrative form) include: 
a.  Colors; 
b.  Construction materials and method; 
c.  Architectural design; 
d.  Illumination method; 
e.  Copy style; 
f.  Sign type and location; and 
g.  In the case of a shopping center or multiple occupancy complex and developments with multiple structures on site, including out-parcels, the unified sign plan must indicate conformance with the following: 
1.  All wall signs for multi-use buildings must be located at a consistent location on the building facade, except that anchor tenants may vary from this locational requirement in scale with the anchor's larger primary facade dimensions. All signs must adhere to the dimensions provided for in the unified signage plan; and 
2.  Pole signs must include colors and/or materials common to those used in the design of the building to which the sign is accessory. A minimum 100 square foot planting area must be provided around the base of any sign. These landscape areas must include shrubs and ground cover plants with a minimum of 50 percent coverage of the landscape area at the time of planting. Turfgrass is discouraged and is limited to ten percent of the landscape area. 
(2)  Building permit requests. Requests for building permits for permanent on-premises signs must adhere to the unified signage plan, which will be kept on file in the city. Requests to permit a new sign, or to relocate, replace, or structurally alter an existing sign must be accompanied by a unified sign plan for the building or project the sign is accessory to. Existing permitted signs may remain in place; however, all future requests for permits, whether for a new sign, or relocation, alteration, or replacement of an existing sign, must adhere to the unified sign plan for the property. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-630), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-495. - Out-parcels. 
    The purpose and intent of these provisions is to ensure unified architectural design and site planning between out-parcel buildings and the main building on the site, to enhance the visual impact of the buildings, and to provide for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access and movement within the site. 
(1)  Two exterior facades of an out-parcel building must be treated as primary facades and must employ architectural, site, and landscaping design elements which are common to the theme used on the main development on site including colors and materials associated with the main building. 
(2)  When the use of common wall, side-by-side development occurs, continuity of facades and consolidated parking for several businesses on one parking lot may be used. 
(3)  Out-parcel structures that are adjacent to each other must provide for vehicular connection between their respective parking lots and provide for interconnection of pedestrian walkways. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-640), 1-19-2005) 
Sec. 3-496. - Exceptions and interpretations. 
(a)  Exceptions. Unless specifically indicated to the contrary, deviations and variances to the provisions of this article may not be granted due to the flexibility and choice of design incorporated into the provisions. 
(b)  Interpretations. Should an applicant and staff be unable to concur on the application of a specific provision of this article, the city manager or designee is authorized to make a final determination. The city manager or designee must render a finding in writing within 15 days of receipt of a written request from the applicant. The determination of the city manager or designee may not be appealed. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, § 1(3-650), 1-19-2005)

(a)  Applicability. All standards set forth in section 3-489 apply to the large-scale retail establishments, with the following exceptions: 
(b)  Primary facade standards. 
(1)  The city will establish an administrative code to show illustrative examples of architectural renderings for guidance to design professionals. 
(2)  Reserved. 
(3)  Principal structures must include a covered walkway or arcade with a minimum depth of 16 feet. At least 20 percent, or 30 feet, whichever is greater, of the sidewalk along the exterior wall must be covered in front of the entrance. 
(4)  Facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings or other such features along no less than 60 percent of their horizontal length. 
(5)  Small retail stores. Where large-scale retail establishments contain additional, separately owned stores with separate, exterior customer entrances (outparcel or line building), the street level facade of such stores shall be transparent between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no less than 60 percent of the horizontal length of the building facade of such additional stores. Where additional stores will be located in the large retail establishment, each such store shall have at least one exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the architectural standards of section 3-489. 
(c)  Variations in massing. The design of large-scale retail establishments must preclude a monolithic building mass and provide a human scale of architecture. The design emphasis must include projections and recesses as follows: 
(1)  For building footprints between 40,000 and 70,999 square feet, projections and recesses shall have a cumulative minimum depth of 16 feet within a maximum uninterrupted length of 95 feet. 
(2)  For buildings between 71,000 and 110,999 square feet, projections and recesses shall have a cumulative minimum depth of 20 feet within a maximum uninterrupted length of 125 feet. 
(3)  For buildings 110,000 square feet and above, projections and recesses shall have a cumulative minimum depth of 24 feet within a maximum uninterrupted length of 150 feet. 
(4)  Where the depth of projections and recesses is less than eight feet, the building design must incorporate variations in building texture, paint color, and/or other architectural features to meet the intent of this requirement. Where the depth of the projection and recesses is less than three feet, the variation will not be utilized towards the calculations of the minimum requirements of this subsection. 
(5)  The applicant may request a deviation at time of planned development rezoning or an alternate design request prior to or at time of local development order review in accordance with this chapter. Applicant will be required to submit at the time of local development order review through the provisions of an alternate architectural betterment plan in accordance with section 3-488. The alternate betterment plan is subject to architectural review by the city, and must demonstrate compliance with the stated intent of reducing building mass and providing a human scale of building design and may be achieved through a variety of architectural methods including, but not limited to: variations in roofline, building texture, paint color, or the inclusion of features such as colonnades, porches, arcades, etc.

The structural design of all members of vehicular bridges and culverts shall be in accordance with the requirements of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, referred to in this section as AASHTO standard specifications for highway bridges and the state department of transportation standard specifications for road and bridge construction. 2.  Pedestrian and utility crossings. These crossings shall be designed according to a recognized rational analysis. B.  Design loading. The loading for the design of waterway crossings shall be as follows: 1.  Vehicular bridge and culvert crossings. The loading of a vehicular bridge shall be one of the following as designated by the AASHTO specifications: Arterial streets: H20-S16-44. All other streets: H20-44. Wind load: AASHTO adjusted to 120 miles per hour for structures over 30 feet in height. 2.  Pedestrian crossings. Live load. At the option of the design engineer subject to approval of the city engineer/public works manager. Dead load. As designed. Wind load. Florida Building Code. 3.  Utility crossings. Live load. At the option of the design engineer subject to approval of the city engineer/public works manager. Dead load. As designed. Wind load. Florida Building Code. C.  Size dimensions of waterway structures. The dimensions of all waterway structures shall be no less than the following: 1.  Width. a.  Vehicular bridges. Requirements as described in the AASHTO standard specifications for highway bridges. b.  Pedestrian crossing. A minimum clear width between handrails of five feet is required. c.  Utility crossing. A utility crossing shall be designed wide enough to suit the facility it is supporting. d.  Culverts. Box culvert crossings shall be designed to conform to the roadway requirements of vehicular bridges over the entire cross section, including roadway width, curb height, sidewalk, handrail, and drainage. 2.  Length. a.  Bridges or utility crossings. The length of structure shall be a function of the waterway to be crossed. In no case shall the clear length between abutments be less than the sum of the following measured along the centerline of the roadway or structure: i. Waterway bottom width. ii. Horizontal projection of approved bank slope. iii. Berms. Width as required by the preliminary approval. iv. Plus additional width as may be required for future widening of channel. v. Or as required for drainage. b.  Culverts. The culvert section should be selected to suit the special conditions of the proposed location, such as canal capacity, pipe cover, design water elevation, drainage area, etc. Culverts under roads shall be long enough to accommodate the roadway, shoulders, rails or barriers, and side slopes. 3.  Height elevation. a.  Bridges or utility crossings. The city engineer/public works manager and any other controlling agency, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, will establish the minimum design water elevation of the waterway to be crossed and the minimum clear vertical distance between the design water elevation and the lowest point of the superstructure. A survey of all upstream boat heights may be required. b.  Culverts. The city engineer/public works manager must approve the design water elevation. The cover over a culvert shall be as required by the design loading on the particular type of culvert to be used. 4.  Utilities. Provisions shall be made in or on all bridges for all applicable present and future utilities as specified by the city engineer/public works manager. However, utilities shall be hung from the bridge only as a last resort. D.  Geometrics. 1.  Location and alignment. All bridges shall be designed with abutments and intermediate bents parallel with the waterway flow, and all culverts shall be located parallel with the waterway flow. 2.  Horizontal curves. When a bridge is located on a horizontal curve, the bridge shall be designed and constructed concentric to the centerline curve. When a box culvert is located on a horizontal curve and the roadway is directly on the culvert and there are no headwalls, the culvert shall be long enough to accommodate the roadway plus shoulders and rail or barrier. If the headwalls are used and act as curbs, they shall be cast concentric to the centerline curve. If the roadway is placed on fill, the culvert shall be long enough to accommodate the roadway, shoulders, rail or barrier, and side slopes. 3.  Approach grades and vertical curves. If the design elevation of a bridge or culvert structure differs from the connecting roadway elevation, the connection shall be made with approach grades not to exceed four percent with an appropriate vertical summit curve over the bridge and vertical sag curves at each approaching roadway connection. It shall be further required that all AASHTO nonpassing sight distance requirements be met. E.  Materials and tests. 1.  Bridge structures. All permanent bridge structures shall be designed for, and constructed of, reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, or approved structural metal. This shall include both substructure and superstructure. An exception may be made for footbridge piling, in which case timber may be used; provided it meets the requirements of the city building code. 2.  Culverts. All culverts under roadways in which the distance from the finished pavement centerline to the top of the culvert is less then one foot six inches shall be reinforced concrete pipe. Corrugated steel pipe, if bituminous coated, or corrugated aluminum pipe, may be used in other locations. All pipes shall conform to all requirements of the state department of transportation standard specifications. 3.  Backfill at bridge approaches. All bridge approach embankments shall be compacted to a density of no less than 96 percent of the maximum dry density as determined by AASHTO T-180 designation for an approved backfill material. 4.  Material test. All material used in a bridge or culvert structure may be subjected to tests. Tests, if required by the city engineer/public works manager, shall be paid for by the developer. Minimum tests shall be for concrete slump and compression strength in accordance with state department of transportation standard specifications. 5.  Unusual design. The city engineer/public works manager may require tests of structural members of an unusual design. Tests, if required by the city engineer/public works manager, shall be paid for by the developer. F.  Design criteria. 1.  Vehicular and pedestrian bridges. All components and loading requirements of the bridge construction shall conform to the current AASHTO standard specifications for highway bridges. 2.  Pedestrian bridge railings. Each rail of the handrail for pedestrian bridges must be so designed that it will withstand a load of 100 pounds per linear foot simultaneously applied horizontally and vertically. Handposts shall be designed to withstand a load of 100 pounds per linear foot applied to the top rail in the directions producing the maximum movement. 3.  Special protection in addition to handrails. For certain locations the city engineer/public works manager may require additional protection for the safety of pedestrians. 4.  Approach slabs. All vehicular bridges having a surface elevation equal to the roadway elevation shall be provided with reinforced concrete approach slabs equal to the bridge roadway width and extending a minimum of 15 feet from the abutment as measured parallel with the centerline of the roadway. 5.  Drainage. a.  On bridges. The bridge roadway shall slope a minimum of three-sixteenths of an inch per foot from crown to curb. All two-lane bridges shall have a drainage structure equivalent to a four-inch pipe located no greater than 20 feet center to center each side. These drains shall be located to prevent the discharge of water against any portion of the structure. b.  On approaches and embankments. Drainage facilities shall be provided for the bridge approaches that are adequate to prevent erosion of the embankment. This may require curbs, gutters and spillways along roadway edges from the bridge to the bottom of the approach embankment. 6.  Guardrail. State department of transportation approved guardrails shall be provided in accordance with state department of transportation standards. Greater lengths may be required if deemed necessary by the city engineer/public works manager. 7.  Concrete reinforcement cover. All cover requirements of the ACI 318 Code shall be followed. In extreme sea exposure conditions, the city engineer/public works manager may require special additional cover. 8.  Penetration and cover for piles. a.  Penetration into soil. i.  Freestanding piles (intermediate bents). All freestanding piles shall have a minimum penetration of one-third of their length, but not less than ten feet in firm material; provided, however, that penetration is sufficient to develop the required capacity of the pile. ii.  Fully supported piles (abutments). Where stable bank slopes are provided, the minimum tip elevation of the piles shall be equal to the elevation of the channel bottom. Where vertical bank slopes may occur, the minimum tip elevation of the piles shall be ten feet below the channel bottom. b.  Penetration into pile cap. The minimum penetration of a pile into a cap shall be 12 inches; provided adequate anchorage is obtained. c.  Concrete cover. The minimum cover between the exterior face of piling and the nearest exterior face of pile cap shall be six inches. 9.  Bridge abutments. The abutments of vehicular bridges shall be constructed upon pile foundations or any other engineered system that is proved to be adequate and accepted by the city engineer/public works manager. 10.  Concrete retaining slabs. All retaining walls or retaining slabs designed to support the embankment adjacent to a bridge structure shall be provided with a positive means of anchorage to the abutments or pile caps. The retaining walls and slabs shall be designed to resist all loads which are expected to come upon them, including all live loads required by AASHTO standard specifications for highway bridges. 11.  Test borings for bridges. a.  Vehicular bridges. A minimum of two test borings shall be required for each bridge location. These borings shall be made as close as possible to the location of two of the pile bents of the proposed structure. The borings shall be performed under the control of a registered engineer and two copies of the results shall be attached to the plans submitted to the city for approval. In addition to the two test borings, the city engineer/public works manager may require other test borings in order that complete subsurface conditions can be determined. b.  Pedestrian bridges. The procedure for pedestrian bridges shall be the same as required above for vehicular bridges, except that a minimum of one test boring is required for each bridge location. This requirement may be waived in the case of small crossings at the discretion of the city engineer/public works manager. G.  Utilities on bridges. Provisions shall be made on all bridges for utility crossings such as water mains, sewer mains, telephone, cablevision or power conduits, and gas mains. Any or all of these requirements for utility support may be waived by the city engineer/public works manager.

These conditions and requirements must be reasonably related to the action requested. 
4.  In the case of a recommendation pertaining to wireless communication facilities, the city council must consider the decision as a recommendation only and may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse, affirm or modify the decision of the zoning board, or remand the case to the zoning board. 
b.  The decision of the city council on any matter listed in this subsection (4) is final. If there is a tie vote, the matter considered will be continued until the next regularly scheduled meeting for decisions on zoning matters by the city council, unless four of the members present and voting agree by motion, before the next agenda item is called, to take some other action. Such other action may be moved or seconded by any member, regardless of his vote on any earlier motion. 
c.  Any denial by the city council is denial with prejudice, unless otherwise specified by the city council (see section 4-200). 
(5)  Judicial review. Judicial review of final decisions under this section must be in accordance with section 4-55. 
(6)  Special master. Final decisions under this section may be the subject of a request for relief under F.S. § 70.51, within 30 days after the decision has been rendered. For the purposes of computing the 30-day period, the date the decision has been rendered is the date of the public hearing at which the city council made such decision by oral motion. The request for relief must allege that a decision of the city council is unreasonable or unfairly burdens the use of the subject property. A request for relief will be heard by an impartial special master in accordance with the procedure set forth in the administrative code. 
(c)  Appeals resulting from acts of administration or city boards 
(1)  The city council will consider appeals resulting from decisions or acts of its community development department or city boards who have been delegated with final decision making powers, including the historic preservation board, tree advisory board, etc., where that board's decision has the right to appeal to the city council. Subject to this section, the city council will conduct hearings and make final decisions concerning appeals from administrative actions where it is claimed that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, interpretation, determination or action of any administrative official (or board with final decision making powers) charged with the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the Land Development Code or any other ordinance that provides for a similar review. 
(2)  No appeal to the city council may lie from any act by an administrative official pursuant to: 
a.  An ordinance, resolution or directive of the city council directing the department of community development to perform such act; 
b.  Any ordinance or other regulation or provision in this Land Development Code which provides a different appellate procedure; 
c.  Zoning verification letters; 
d.  An administrative official's determinations of state or federal statutes, state or federal codes, rules, or regulations. If the city council must interpret or apply state or federal statutes, state or federal codes, rules or regulations in reaching a decision on an appeal, the city council is not authorized to hear the appeal and the case must be dismissed; or 
e.  Appeals of administrative interpretations of the comprehensive plan will be processed in accordance with the administrative section of the comprehensive plan. Likewise, interpretations of the state building code and other technical codes will be processed in accordance with the rights to appeal in those specific codes. 
(3)  No appeal may be considered by city council where it appears to be a circumvention of an established or required procedure. Specifically, in no case may an appeal be heard when the city council determines that the case should more appropriately be heard on a request for a special exception or variance. 
(4)  Unless there is a specific time limit specified in a controlling ordinance, applicants will have 30 days from the date of the specific decision or act of the community development department to appeal the decision, otherwise the use of an appeal is time-barred from consideration. The request must be filed with the city clerk, who will date stamp when filed in that office and transmit the appeal to the director of community development and the city attorney's office. 
(5)  Notices of hearings on appeals will be provided for in the agenda for regular city council meetings. No additional notices will be prepared to affected property owners or the public. Placement of appeals will be on the appeals portion of the agenda. The city attorney will schedule the item at a city council meeting, with the record consisting of the greensheet, application for the appeal, the actual record of the staff decision or act, and a staff response. 
(6)  The city council will not consider appeals for challenges to a development order controlled by F.S. § 163.3215. In cases of challenges to development orders controlled by F.S. § 163.3215, no suit may be brought or filed or accepted for filing until the development order giving rise to the complaint has become final by virtue of its having been issued by the director, or by virtue of its having been ordered by the city council on an appeal reversing the director's denial of the development permit or denial of a development order extension, or by the city council in cases where the city council has granted planned development zoning. Once a development order has been granted, the provisions of F.S. § 163.3215 will be the sole means of challenging the approval of a development order, as that term is defined in F.S. § 163.3164(6), when the approval of the development order is alleged to be inconsistent with the Bonita Plan, in which case an action brought pursuant to F.S. § 163.3215 will be limited exclusively to the issue of comprehensive plan consistency. 
(7)  Except as may be required by F.S. § 163.3215, and then only pursuant to that statute, a third party will not have standing to appeal an administrative decision. Only the applicant or their agent will be permitted to appeal such administrative action as set forth in this section. 
(8)  Considerations. 
a.  In reaching a decision, city council must consider the following criteria, as well as any other issues that are pertinent and reasonable: 
1.  Whether appeal is of a nature properly brought before the city council for a decision. 
2.  The plain and ordinary meaning of all applicable ordinance or code provisions, unless the language is unclear or ambiguous; then the intent of the ordinance or code provision applied or interpreted may be considered. 
b.  Staff recommendations, the testimony of the parties and witnesses and testimony of the general public must also be considered. 
c.  All parties may present evidence and testimony as to laws or facts supporting their position in the case. 
(9)  Findings. Before granting an appeal, the city council must determine if an error was made by the administrative official or advisory board. 
(10)  Authority. The city council has the authority to reverse, affirm or modify the decisions or actions of the administrative official.

Sec. 4-54. - Rehearing of decisions. 
(a)  Any person who may be aggrieved by a decision the city council made pursuant to an application for rezoning, development of regional impact, special exception that meets the criteria of a development of city impact, or special exceptions or variances adopted on their own as a resolution or heard as part of a rezoning, may file a written request for a public rehearing by the city council for a modification or rescission of the decision. The request must be filed with the director of community development and the city attorney's office within 15 calendar days after the decision. For purposes of computing the 15-day period, the date of the decision is the date of the public hearing at which the city council made its decision by oral motion. 
(b)  All requests for a public rehearing must state with particularity any new evidence or the points of law or fact which the aggrieved person argues the city council has overlooked or misunderstood, and must include all documentation offered to support the request for a rehearing. The city council will decide whether to grant or deny the request for a rehearing based exclusively upon the aggrieved person's written request and supporting documentation and the administrator's written analysis thereof. In addition, if the request is made by one other than the original applicant, the city must notify the applicant of the filing of the request for a rehearing and the applicant must be allowed to submit his independent written analysis. The deliberations of the city council with respect to the question of whether to grant a rehearing do not constitute a public hearing, and no oral testimony will be allowed or considered by the city council in the course of these deliberations. An aggrieved person need not request a rehearing in order to exhaust his administrative remedies as a condition precedent to filing an appeal to the circuit court. 
(c)  Judicial review. The proper filing of a petition for rehearing will toll the 30-day time limit set forth for judicial review of final decisions in section 4-55. If a rehearing request is refused, or if the request is granted but modification or rescission of the original motion of the city council is denied, any aggrieved person may, within 30 calendar days after such refusal or denial, apply for judicial review of the original motion in accordance with section 4-55. No judicial review is available to review the city council decision to refuse a rehearing request. 
(d)  There is no right to apply to court for relief on account of any determination or recommendation of the zoning board in those actions listed in section 4-53(b)(1) which require public hearing before the city council. 
(Ord. No. 03-15; Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-84), 1-19-2011; Ord. No. 11-04, § 1(4-84), 3-16-2011) 
Sec. 4-55. - Final decision; judicial review. 
(a)  Any final decision of the city council may be reviewed by the circuit court unless otherwise provided in this article. Except for review of verified complaints filed pursuant to F.S. § 163.3215, jurisdiction for review of any final decision of the city council lies exclusively in circuit court. This review may only be obtained through filing a petition for writ of certiorari pursuant to the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. Any such petition must be filed within 30 calendar days after the decision has been rendered. For the purposes of computing the 30-day period, the date that the decision has been rendered is the date of the public hearing at which the city council made such decision by oral motion. 
(b)  The person making application to the city council for any final decision that is entitled to judicial review is a necessary and indispensable party to any action seeking judicial review.

d.  The granting of the variance will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare; and 
e.  The condition or situation of the specific piece of property, or the intended use of the property, for which the variance is sought is not of a general or recurrent nature so as to make it more reasonable and practical to amend the ordinance. 
(4)  Authority.

b.  In reaching their decision, the zoning board has the authority to attach conditions and requirements necessary for the protection of the health, safety, comfort, convenience or welfare of the general public.

h.  The zoning board must also find that public facilities are, or will be, available and adequate to serve the proposed land use. 
(4)  Authority. 
a.  The zoning board serves in an advisory capacity to the city council with respect to zoning matters as set forth in subsection (d)(1) of this section, and in such capacity, may not make final determinations. 
b.  The zoning board may not recommend the approval of a rezoning, and the city council may not approve a rezoning, other than the request published in the newspaper pursuant to F.S. § 166.041 unless the zoning district proposed by the zoning board is more restrictive and permitted within the land use classification set forth in the Bonita Plan.

DIVISION 6. - APPLICATIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR CHANGES, PERMITS, INTERPRETATIONS AND APPROVALS 

Sec. 4-193. - General procedure for applications requiring public hearing. 
(a)  Initiation of application. An application for a rezoning, special exception, or variance may be initiated by: 
(1)  A landowner, or his authorized agent, for his own property; provided, however, that: 
a.  Except as provided in subsections (a)(1)b. and c. of this section, where there is more than one owner, either legal or equitable, then all owners must jointly initiate the application or petition. 
1.  This does not mean that both a husband and wife must initiate the application on private real property which is owned by them. 
2.  Where the property is subject to a land trust agreement, the trustee may initiate the application. 
3.  Where the fee owner is a corporation, any duly authorized corporate official may initiate the application. 
4.  Where the fee owner is a partnership, a general partner may initiate the application. 
5.  Where the fee owner is an association, the association or its governing body may appoint an agent to initiate the application on behalf of the association. 
b.  Where the property is a condominium or a timeshare condominium, as defined and regulated in F.S. chs. 718 and 721, respectively, an application or petition may be initiated by both the condominium association and no less than 75 percent of the total number of condominium unit owners, or by both the owners' association and no less than 75 percent of timeshare condominium unit owners. 
1.  For purposes of this subsection, each individually owned condominium unit within the condominium complex and each individually owned timeshare unit as defined by F.S. ch. 721 counts as one unit, regardless of the number of individuals who jointly own the unit. 
2.  In order to verify ownership, the applicants must furnish the city, as part of their application, a complete list of all unit owners, identified by unit number and timeshare period, as applicable, along with proof that all unit owners who did not join in the application were given actual written notice thereof by the applicants, who must verify the list and fact of notice by sworn affidavit. 
3.  So as to protect the legal rights of nonparticipating unit owners, the application must be accompanied by a letter of opinion from a licensed state attorney, who must attest that he has examined the declaration of condominium, the bylaws of the condominium association, and all other relevant legal documents or timeshare documents, as applicable, and concluded that the act of applying or petitioning to the city violates none of the provisions therein, or any federal or state law regulating condominiums or timeshare plans, or the rights of any of the nonparticipating unit owners, as derived from such documents and laws, and that approval of the requested act by the city would violate no such rights. 
c.  Where the property is a subdivision, an application or petition may be initiated by no less than 75 percent of the total number of lot or parcel owners and the homeowners' association, if applicable. 
1.  For purposes of this subsection, a subdivision is an area of property defined by a specific boundary in which lot divisions have been established on a plat that has been recorded in either a plat book or official records book whereby legal descriptions are referred to by lot or parcel number. The term "subdivision" may include any unit or phase of the subdivision and not the entire subdivision. 
2.  In order to verify ownership, the applicants must furnish the city, as part of their application, a complete list of all lot owners, identified by lot number, along with proof that all lot owners who did not join in the application were given actual written notice thereof by the applicants, who must verify the list and fact of notice by sworn affidavit. 
(2)  The term "city," for purposes of this section, means the city council. 
(b)  Application submittal and official receipt procedure. The application procedure and requirements in this section apply to all applications for rezoning, special exceptions, and variances. 
(1)  All properties within a single application must be abutting. The director may, at his discretion, allow a single application to cover non-abutting properties where it is in the public interest due to the size or scope and nature of the request, and there is a rational continuity to the properties in question. 
(2)  No application may be accepted unless it is presented on the official forms provided by the department, or on city-approved computer-generated forms containing the same information. 
a.  Forms must include, but not be limited to, disclosure forms for corporations, trusts and partnerships, and disclosure of information regarding contract purchases and their percentages of interest. 
b.  Disclosure will not be required of any entity whose interests are solely equity interests which are regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States or another country. 
c.  Disclosure forms, established by administrative code, must be included in the materials distributed to the zoning board and the city council for all cases in which the city council has the final decision. 
d.  Subsections (b)(2)a. through c. of this section do not apply to city-initiated rezonings. 
(3)  Before an application may be accepted, it must fully comply with all information requirements enumerated in section 4-194, unless specifically stated otherwise in this chapter. 
(4)  The applicant must ensure that an application is accurate and complete. Any additional expenses necessitated because of inaccurate or incomplete information will be borne by the applicant. 
(5)  Upon receipt of the completed application form, all required documents and the filing fee, the department will place the request on the appropriate agenda and inform the applicant of the hearing dates, or, in the case of planned development applications, begin reviewing the application for sufficiency pursuant to section 4-295(d). 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-201), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-194. - General submittal requirements for applications requiring public hearing. 
(a)  All applications. Every request for actions requiring a public hearing under this chapter must include the following. However, upon written request, on a form prepared by the city, the director may modify the submittal requirements contained in this section where it can be clearly demonstrated that the submission will have no bearing on the review and processing of the application. The request and the director's written response must accompany the application submitted and will become a part of the permanent file. 
(1)  Legal description. A legal description of the property must include a copy of the plat, if any, and the county STRAP number. The director has the right to reject any legal description which is not sufficiently detailed so as to locate the property on county maps or section aerial maps. 
(2)  Certified sketch of description. A certified sketch of description is required, unless the subject property consists of one or more undivided platted lots. If the application includes multiple abutting parcels, the legal description must describe the perimeter boundary of the total area, but need not describe each individual parcel. However, the STRAP number for each parcel must be included. The director may require a boundary survey prepared by a surveyor meeting the minimum technical standards for land surveying in the state where there is a question regarding the accuracy of the legal description of the property. Boundaries must be clearly marked with a heavy line. The boundary line must include the entire area to be developed. If the request is owner-initiated, flood zone and required finished floor elevation must be shown as well as the location of existing structures on the property. 
(3)  Confirmation of ownership. If at any time during the review process the director concludes there is a question regarding ownership of the property, the director may require submittal of a title insurance policy, attorney's opinion of title, or ownership and encumbrance report. 
(4)  Area location map. A map, at suitable scale, indicating the property described in the legal description. The map must be sufficiently referenced to known major streets or other physical boundaries so as to be clearly identifiable to the general public. 
(5)  Property owners list. A complete list of all property owners, and their mailing addresses, for all property within the area described. For the purpose of this subsection, names and addresses of property owners will be deemed to be those appearing on the latest tax rolls of the county. The applicant is responsible for the accuracy of such list. 
(6)  Surrounding property owners list. A complete list of all property owners, and their mailing addresses, for all property within 375 feet of the perimeter of the subject parcel or the portion thereof that is the subject of the request. For the purpose of this subsection, names and addresses of property owners will be deemed to be those appearing on the latest tax rolls of the county at the time of sufficiency. The applicant is responsible for the accuracy of such list. This list is for the purpose of mailing notice to property owners within 375 feet of the property described. The notice is a courtesy only and is not jurisdictional. Accordingly, the city's failure to mail or to timely mail such notice or failure of any affected property owner to receive mailed notice will not constitute a defect in notice or bar the public hearing as scheduled. 
(7)  Property owners map. A map displaying all parcels of property within 375 feet of the perimeter of the subject parcel or the portion thereof that is the subject of the request. This map must reference by number or other symbol the names on the property owners list. The applicant is responsible for the accuracy of the map. 
(8)  Additional material. Additional material, depending on the specific type of action requested, may be required as set forth in sections 4-194(b) and 4-195. 
(9)  Filing fee. All fees, in accordance with the duly adopted fee schedule (see section 4-31), must be paid at the time the application is submitted. 
(b)  Additional submittal requirements for owner-initiated applications. In addition to the submittal requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section, every application initiated by a property owner involving a change in the zoning district boundaries, or a request for special exception, deviation or variance, applicable to the property owners land must include the following: 
(1)  Evidence of authority. 
a.  Ownership interests. A list of all persons or entities having an ownership interest in the property, including the names of all stockholders and trust beneficiaries. Disclosure with respect to a beneficial ownership interest in any entity registered with the Federal Securities Exchange Commission or registered pursuant to F.S. ch. 517, whose interest is for sale to the general public, is exempt from the provision of this subsection. 
b.  Unified control document. A notarized statement evidencing a property owner's or entity's right and authority to impose covenants and restrictions on the parcel or otherwise bind the property with respect to conditions necessary to secure the approval requested. A notarized statement submitted to the city establishing a property owner or entity's right and authority to impose covenants and restrictions on a parcel as a result of the issuance of development approval in accordance with this Code. The unified control document also constitutes an agreement that the property owner will not transfer, convey, sell or subdivide the subject parcel unencumbered by the covenants and restrictions imposed as part of the development order permitting process. 
c.  Agent authorization. If the owner authorizes an agent to submit the application and represent the owner in all matters pertaining to the application, the owner must provide the agent with a notarized statement evidencing the agents authority to act on the owners behalf and encumber the property with conditions applicable to the approval requested in the application. An agent may authorize additional agents to assist in the preparation and presentation of the application. However, an agent cannot transfer authority to bind the property with respect to conditions. This later authority will only be recognized by the city when it is provided directly to the agent by the owner. 
d.  Contract purchaser/vendee authorization. If a contract purchaser or vendee is the applicant, a notarized statement from the property owner authorizing the contract purchaser/vendee to act as an agent of the property owner for purposes of application submittal and agreement to conditions applicable to approval of the request is necessary. 
(2)  Property restrictions. The application must include a copy of the deed restrictions or other types of covenants and restrictions on the parcel, along with a statement as to how the restrictions may affect the requested action. If there are no restrictions on the property, the applicant must indicate so on the application form. 
(3)  Affidavit regarding proposed use. If buildings or structures exist on the property, the applicant must submit an affidavit stating that the buildings and structures will be removed or that the proposed use of the buildings, structures and land is, or will be, in compliance with all applicable requirements of chapter 3 and this Code. 
(4)  When applicable, the number of bonus density units requested, the source of the bonus density units (TDRs, housing density bonus, etc.), and the resulting gross residential density of the proposal.

Sec. 4-195. - Additional requirements for applications requiring public hearing. 
(a)  Developments of regional impact. Developments of regional impact must comply with the information submittal and procedural requirements of F.S. ch. 380. If the development of regional impact requires specific zoning actions (i.e., rezoning), the procedures and requirements of this section and article III of this chapter must be met. Additionally, even if the development of regional impact does not require specific zoning action, the applicant must submit a traffic impact statement, as described in section 4-295(a)(7), and detailed in section 3-292. Thresholds for developments of regional impact are established by state law. 
(b)  Planned developments. All planned developments must comply with the additional information submittal and procedural requirements set forth in section 4-295. 
(c)  Rezonings other than planned developments and developments of regional impact. Requests for rezonings, other than planned developments and those determined to be development of regional impact, must include a statement of the basis or reason for the rezoning. The statement must be directed to the guidelines for decision making embodied in sections 4-53 and 4-131. This statement may be utilized by the city council, zoning board and staff in establishing a factual basis for the granting or denial of the rezoning. 
(d)  Rezoning of mobile home parks. If the proposed rezoning of an existing mobile home park, as defined in F.S. § 723.003, would result in the removal or relocation of mobile home owners, then the application must include facts sufficient to allow staff to conclude that adequate mobile home parks or other suitable facilities exist for the relocation of displaced owners. The facts to be provided are intended to meet the requirements of F.S. § 723.083. Therefore, the statutory definitions will prevail to the extent there is conflict with terms of this Code. 
(1)  Facts to be provided may typically include STRAP number and street addresses of properties where mobile homes are to be removed from, and relocated to (i.e., the relocation site); and any building permit numbers issued for placement of the mobile home on the relocation site. 
(2)  If the relocation site is not within the legal description of the subject rezoning, then the property owner of property proposed for relocation must submit an affidavit stating that suitable facilities exist at the relocation site to accommodate the mobile home proposed to be relocated there. 
(e)  Special exceptions. Except for special exceptions that are developments of city impact (see section 4-272), all applications for a special exception must, in addition to the requirements of sections 4-194(a) and (b) and 4-195(e)(1) and (2), include the following: 
(1)  A statement as to how the property qualifies for the special exception requested, and what impact granting the request would have on surrounding properties. Such statement must be directed, at a minimum, to the guidelines for decision making embodied in section 4-131(d)(2). This statement may be utilized by the zoning board and staff in establishing a factual basis for granting or denial of the special exception. 
(2)  A site development plan detailing the proposed use, including, where applicable, the following: 
a.  The location and current use of all existing structures on the site, as well as those on adjacent properties within 100 feet of the perimeter boundaries of the site. 
b.  All proposed structures and uses to be developed on the site. 
c.  Any existing public streets, easements or land reservations within the site, and the proposed means of vehicular access to and from the site. 
d.  A traffic impact analysis of projected trip generation for the development. 
e.  Proposed fencing and screening, if any. 
f.  Any other reasonable information which may be required by the director which is commensurate with the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(3)  Solar or wind energy modifications. If the request is to modify property development regulations for the purposes of using solar or wind energy, evidence must be submitted that the proposed modifications are the minimum necessary to provide for the solar or wind energy proposal and that the proposed modifications will not adversely affect adjacent properties. (See section 4-1896.) 
(4)  Temporary parking lot. If the request is for a temporary parking lot: 
a.  The site plan must show all existing and proposed parking spaces and drives, both paved and unpaved, vehicle access points, and lighting, if any. 
b.  An analysis indicating the need for the temporary parking lot, as well as the anticipated frequency of use, must be submitted. 
c.  If the temporary parking lot is off the premises of the principal use, plans for providing for traffic control and pedestrian safety must be submitted. 
(5)  On-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages. If the request is for a consumption on premises permit: 
a.  The property owners list and map (see section 4-194(a)(4) and (5)) must be modified to include all property within 500 feet of the perimeter of the subject property.

This section applies only where private land, or an interest in private land, as the case may be, is obtained by a governmental or other condemning entity for a public purpose, through purchase, condemnation, threat of condemnation, or otherwise, and that creates a nonconformity in terms of setback, lot size or other standards of this code. This exemption does not apply to right-of-way dedication or other public conveyances of land required by the city in the course of subdivision or other development approvals pursuant to this code. To assure that affected real property can be utilized to the greatest extent possible as it could prior to it having been affected, at the request of either the city or the property owner, the director of community development will process and approve administrative variances for such property, at no cost to the property owner. Notwithstanding the above, decisions by the director pursuant to this section are ministerial and may be appealed by the property owner to city council.

ARTICLE III. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 4-272. - Developments of city impact. 
(a)  The Bonita Plan requires developments of city impact to be developed as planned developments. These developments of city impact, defined in subsection (b) of this section, if not already zoned for the use desired, must be rezoned only to the most applicable planned development category. Other proposed developments, regardless of size, may seek a planned development designation where the developer desires and the division director determines that it is in the public interest to do so. Any request for an residential planned development (RPD) in areas designated as rural or outer islands in the Bonita Plan, which is for the purpose of increasing density over the standard density permitted, will be required to comply with special regulations set forth in sections 4-347 and 4-348 as well as the other requirements set forth in this article. 
(b)  The Bonita Plan provides that certain owner-initiated rezonings and special exceptions meeting specified thresholds will be reviewed as developments of city impact. The development of city impact thresholds are further categorized as major or minor planned developments as follows: 
(1)  Major planned developments. 
a.  A residential development of 300 or more dwelling units. 
b.  Any residential development proposing a density above the standard density range when located in areas designated as rural or outer islands by the Bonita Plan. 
c.  A commercial development or activity located on a parcel of ten or more acres or that includes 100,000 square feet or more of floor area. 
d.  An industrial development or activity located on a parcel of ten or more acres or that includes 100,000 square feet or more of floor area. 
e.  Mining/excavation activities on a parcel of 320 or more acres. 
f.  Noncommercial schools (except Lee County School District) proposed to have over 100 students. 
g.  Animal or reptile exhibits, aquariums, arenas, civic centers, convention or exhibition halls, correctional facilities and prisons, fairgrounds, museums, planetaria, race tracks, regional parks, stadiums, and zoos, on ten or more acres of land. 
h.  A health care facility Group V (hospital), that is not a part of a commercial or community facility planned development. 
i.  Any other development required to apply for planned development zoning pursuant to sections 4-716 through 4-719, and as set forth in sections 4-2037 through 4-2045, pertaining to sports/amusement parks and recreational facilities. 
j.  Residential uses within the interchange commercial area as specified by the Bonita Plan. 
k.  Any combination of the above-listed land uses where the sum of the percentages of each applicable individual threshold is equal to or greater than 100 percent. 
l.  Any development of regional impact not included in subsections (b)(1)a. through h. of this section. 
m.  Any development which includes the aboveground storage of more than 40,000 gallons of petroleum. 
n.  Any proposed hotel/motel which will contain more than 200 rental units or which will exceed the equivalency factors set forth in section 4-1529(4)b., when divided by the Bonita Plan maximum standard density for the property in question. 
(2)  Minor planned developments. 
a.  Botanical or zoological gardens, community parks, libraries, nature centers, religious facilities (excluding place of worship), state or federal parks, on ten or more acres of land. 
b.  A health care facility Group II or III, social service Group III or IV community residential home, continuing care facility (CCF), or hospice, of 50 or more beds, which is not a part of a residential, commercial, or community facility planned development. 
c.  Any other development required to apply for planned development zoning as set forth in sections 4-434 through 4-685. 
d.  Except as listed below, any other application for planned development rezoning that does not meet or exceed the thresholds in section 4-272(b)(1)(a) through (l) will be reviewed as minor planned development. 
1.  Existing development. An application for an existing development, such as a mobile home development, which has already been developed but does not conform to the regulations for a conventional district, that requests a rezoning to a planned development classification, will be reviewed in the same manner as a minor planned development, except that a traffic impact statement will not be required. 
2.  Amendments to application. Applications for amendments to an approved major or minor master concept plan or its attendant documentation, or for the extension of a previously vacated master concept plan (for plans approved prior to December 2, 1991) will be treated procedurally as minor planned developments. These applications will require only as much information as is needed to describe the changes requested, to specify the incremental change in impacts expected from the amendment, and to detail the changes in development, environment and background (surrounding land use, traffic volumes, water, wastewater and other service availability, etc.), that have occurred since the original application. 
(c)  Bonita Beach Road Corridor. To further the purpose and intent of the Bonita Beach Corridor Plan, the following uses must have planned development zoning if located within the Bonita Beach Road Corridor on a lot or parcel larger than one acre:

(2)  Any development which is less than 80 percent of the thresholds listed in section 4-272(b)(1) is conclusively presumed not to be a development of city impact. Any development which is more than 80 percent but less than 100 percent of the appropriate threshold is rebuttably presumed not to be a development of city impact. Any development which is more than 100 percent but less than 120 percent of any threshold is rebuttably presumed to be a development of city impact. Any development which exceeds 120 percent of any threshold is conclusively presumed to be a development of city impact. 
(3)  The director will consider the following items in determining the development of city impact status of a proposed rezoning or special exception: 
a.  The compatibility of the proposed zoning district with neighboring zoning districts and uses; 
b.  The impact of the proposed zoning change on existing and proposed transportation facilities; 
c.  The impact of the proposed zoning change on other urban services, as defined in the Bonita Plan; and 
d.  The impact of the proposed zoning change on environmentally critical areas. 
(4)  For the purpose of determining whether a parcel is a development of city impact, all abutting parcels which are in common ownership or control may be identified and taken into account in both determining development of city impact status and estimating the impacts of any proposed development. 
(5)  The director's decision is an administrative decision which may be appealed in accordance with the procedure in this article.

(4)  Developments of regional impact. The contents of a complete and sufficient application for development approval (ADA) per F.S. ch. 380 duplicate or exceed the submittal requirements of this chapter. 
(c)  Amendments to built planned developments (PD). 
(1)  Part or all of a planned development which is built may be the subject of an application for a variance or other approval covered by this chapter wherein the subject property is the only part of the original planned development for which the approval is sought. If the subject property meets the threshold for a development of city impact, it will be reviewed in accordance with the provisions in this chapter which apply to developments of city impact. If the subject property is not a development of city impact, it will be reviewed in accordance with the provisions in this chapter which apply to conventional zoning districts. In either case, the applicant will be the owner of the subject property and the consent of the owners of the remainder of the original planned development will be unnecessary. However, these owners must be given notice of the application and other proceedings as if they were owners of property abutting the subject property regardless of their actual proximity to the subject property. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection (c), the term "built" means that all of the roads, utilities, buffering, open space, surface water management features and structures, common space, common amenities, common landscaping, gatehouses, entrance signs, entrance ways and other similar items identified as part of the final approved master concept plan have been constructed and acknowledged by the city as complete. In the case of residential planned developments or mixed developments which include residential structures, the term "built" does not mean that all residential structures must have been constructed on individual platted lots. 
(d)  Sufficiency. 
(1)  No hearing will be scheduled for an application for a planned development until the application has been found sufficient. 
a.  All applications for planned developments will be deemed sufficient unless a letter advising the applicant of insufficiencies has been provided within 45 working days of submittal of the application. 
b.  All amended applications will be deemed sufficient unless a subsequent letters advising the applicant of any insufficiencies has been mailed within 45 working days of the resubmittal. The contents of insufficiency letters will be limited to brief explanations of the manner in which insufficient applications do not comply with the formal requirements in this section and any provisions within the land development code. 
c.  Staff may not request additional information from the applicant more than three times, unless the applicant waives the limitation in writing. Before a third request for additional information, the applicant must be offered a meeting to attempt to resolve outstanding issues. If the applicant believes the request for additional information is not authorized by ordinance, rule, statute, or other legal authority, the city, at the applicant's request, shall proceed to process the application for approval or denial. 
d.  After notice of insufficiency, the applicant has 60 days to submit supplemental or corrected documents, unless a longer time is agreed to in writing by the director and the applicant prior to the expiration of the 60 days. If the supplement or corrections are not submitted within the 60 days (or other time period agreed to) the application will be deemed withdrawn. 
e.  Once an application has been found sufficient, it will be scheduled for public hearing. Any new information submitted by the applicant, or any changes made to information submitted for the sufficiency review, which is provided after the finding of sufficiency may, at the discretion of the director, be grounds for a deferral or continuance of the public hearing, depending on the advertised status of the hearing. 
(2)  DRIs. Where a proposed planned development is identified by staff as a possible development of regional impact, the applicant will be notified that the application will be deemed sufficient only when accompanied by either a binding letter of interpretation from DEO or a complete and sufficient application for development approval (ADA). Failure by the city to notify the applicant in a timely manner (within 30 days of the application) will nullify any finding of insufficiency based on this requirement. Assuming the application is sufficient in all other respects, staff will commence its review of the planned development. However, there will be no hearing held before the zoning board until the applicant submits a binding letter of interpretation from DEO or a complete and sufficient ADA.

Sec. 4-296. - Covenant of unified control. 
(a)  Any applicant for a rezoning or master concept plan confirmation under the planned development regulations as provided in this article must submit documentation corroborating unified control over the subject property. 
(b)  If the initial applicant conveys all or part of the subject property to a subsequent purchaser, the conveyance is subject to the original covenant of unified control unless an amended covenant is filed with the director. This document must be filed within 60 days of closing, and must be recorded with other notices related to the planned development. This requirement does not apply to individual homesites or units (apartments) of a residential development or to any development wherein the obligation to enforce the regulations and conditions or covenants and restrictions is delegated to property owners or a condominium association or cooperative. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-374), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-297. - Prehearing conference. 
    Prior to the public hearing by the zoning board on an application under this division, community development may schedule and conduct a conference to facilitate a meeting of the applicant and staff persons from all relevant city, county, state, substate regional and federal agencies and special use districts. The purpose of this meeting is to identify, discuss and resolve various issues and to advise the applicant of staff concerns and potential recommendations. The product of this conference will include the staff's recommendations based upon the original or an amended application, and the applicant's written objections, if any. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-375), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-298. - Prehearing stipulation. 
(a)  If the applicant wishes to enter a stipulation under this division he must file a stipulation setting out the issues on which he and the staff do not agree, with the zoning board no less than one working day prior to the date of the hearing. The stipulation must be signed by the applicant or his representative and, if there are any disputed issues, by the city planner responsible for the preparation of the staff report. Neither the staff nor the applicant may alter their positions on issues that were not listed as disputed on the stipulation at the hearing without the consent of the other party or the zoning board. 
(b)  The prehearing stipulation will not be construed to limit the issues that may be raised by the zoning board or members of the general public. Neither the applicant nor the staff will be bound by the terms of the stipulation to the extent that new issues may be raised by the general public or the zoning board. 
(c)  If the stipulation is not filed by the date required in subsection (a) of this section, the hearing must be continued unless the zoning board determines that the absence of the stipulation will not materially impair the ability to understand the case. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-376), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-299. - Public hearing. 
(a)  Hearing before zoning board. After the staff prehearing conference required by this division, the application will be scheduled for a public hearing before the zoning board. 
(1)  At the public hearing the zoning board will consider the application in accordance with article II of this chapter. 
(2)  The recommendation made to the city council must be supported by formal findings that address the guidelines set forth in section 4-131. In addition, the findings must address whether the following criteria can be satisfied: 
a.  The proposed use or mix of uses is appropriate at the subject location; 
b.  The recommended conditions to the concept plan and other applicable regulations provide sufficient safeguards to the public interest. 
c.  The recommended conditions are reasonably related to the impacts on the public's interest created by or expected from the proposed development. 
(3)  If the zoning board determines that a recommended condition is insufficient, they may recommend an alternate condition for consideration by the city council. 
(4)  If the application includes a schedule of deviations pursuant to section 4-326, the zoning board's recommendation must approve, approve with modification or reject each requested deviation based upon a finding that each item: 
a.  Enhances the achievement of the objectives of the planned development; and 
b.  Preserves and promotes the general intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
If the zoning board concludes that the application omits necessary deviations, they may include those omitted deviations in its recommendation without an additional hearing. 
(5)  As a condition of approval of a deviation, the zoning board may recommend that the applicant receive administrative approval of a more detailed development plan for each affected development area. Applications for administrative approval will be processed as administrative amendments in accordance with section 4-302 and may be granted by the director upon a finding that public health, safety, and welfare will not be adversely affected by the request. 
(b)  Hearing before city council. 
(1)  After the zoning board's hearing, an application for a planned development, together with all attendant information, staff reports and the zoning board minutes and draft ordinance of the recommendation, will be forwarded to the city council. The city council will consider the application in public hearing in accordance with article II of this chapter. 
a.  After reviewing all the identified information, the city council may either: 
1.  Continue further consideration until additional information is provided by the applicant or staff or until the applicant makes changes in the application, subject to re-review by the staff and the zoning board as required; or 
2.  Formally approve, approve with modification, or deny the application. 
b.  If the city council denies the application without prejudice, it may remand the proposal to the staff with directions to bring the application back to the zoning board once the application is amended. If new or additional information, not previously provided to the staff or the zoning board, is supplied by the applicant subsequent to the zoning board hearing, the city council may remand the application to the zoning board for rehearing. 
(2)  The decision of the city council must be supported by a formal finding that, in addition to the guidelines set forth in article II of this chapter, the criteria set forth in subsection (a)(2) of this section have or have not been satisfied. 
(3)  In addition to adopting a master concept plan for the planned development, the city council may adopt any special conditions necessary to address unique aspects of the subject property in the interest of protecting the public health, safety and welfare. If any recommended special condition is found to be insufficient, the city council may substitute its own language for such special condition in the final resolution. 
(4)  If a schedule of deviations from other provisions of this chapter (see section 4-326) is a part of the planned development application, the city council may approve, approve with modification, or reject the entire schedule or specific items based upon their finding that each item: 
a.  Enhances the achievement of the objectives of the planned development; and 
b.  Preserves and promotes the general intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
(5)  The city council may require, as a condition of approval of the deviation, that the applicant receive administrative approval of a more specific development plan for each affected development area or parcel. Applications for administrative approval will be processed as administrative amendments in accordance with section 4-302 and may be granted by the director only upon a finding that the public health, safety, and welfare will not be adversely affected by the request. 
(6)  If the city council denies or modifies the requested use, deviation, or other information shown on the master concept plan, a revised master concept plan must be submitted to community development reflecting the substance of the approved ordinance prior to execution of the ordinance. Legible copies of the revised master concept plan must be provided in three sizes, 24 inches by 36 inches, 11 inches by 17 inches, and 81/2 inches by 11 inches. 
(7)  An application remanded for further consideration must be brought to hearing before the zoning board within six months of the date the remand order is rendered. If the application is not brought forward as ordered within six months, it will be deemed withdrawn. Thereafter, the applicant will be required to file a new application for consideration by the zoning board and the city council. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-377), 1-19-2011; Ord. No. 12-13, § 1(4-377), 8-15-2012) 
Sec. 4-300. - Effect of planned development zoning. 
(a)  Compliance with applicable regulations. After the adoption of the master concept plan and the conditions and auxiliary documentation that govern it, any and all development and subsequent use of land, water and structures within the planned development must be in compliance with the following, in order of precedence: 
(1)  The Bonita Plan. 
(2)  Divisions 1, 2 and 3 of this article. 
(3)  The master concept plan and attendant conditions and auxiliary documentation. 
(4)  Applicable city development regulations in force at the time of final plan submission. 
(5)  The general provisions of this chapter, unless otherwise excepted by an approved schedule of deviations. 
(b)  Applicability of development regulations. All approvals of general aspects of the master concept plan (see section 4-295(a)(5)) are conceptual only, and are subject to all development regulations established to protect health, safety and welfare that are in force at the time of the final plan review. Reliance in detail on the approval of a general aspect of the master concept plan is not justified and is not in good faith. 
(c)  Recording of notice. The department must record a notice of master concept plan approval in the official records of the county. The notice should include a statement which explains that the master concept plan approval is an encumbrance on the real estate described in the plan. 
(d)  Prohibitions. 
(1)  The introduction of a use of land or water not provided for on the master concept plan or attendant documentation thereto. 
(2)  Creation of a development parcel or outparcel not specified on the master concept plan. 
(3)  No development parcel or outparcel may be created that is not of sufficient size and configuration to support the principal use proposed together with all accessory land and water uses, such as open space, parking, surface water management and the like, or that does not have permanent and irrevocable rights to such space or use on adjacent and abutting property. 
(e)  Enforcement. The obligation to enforce the conditions attached to the master concept plan remains with the original applicant until all of the subject property is developed and certificated for use and occupancy or until a subsequent owner assumes that obligation for all or part of the subject property. Completion or vacation of a phase of the development, or conveyance of a development parcel or outparcel, will relieve the original applicant only as to that phase, development parcel or outparcel, and then only when notice is filed and recorded in accordance with section 4-296. The obligation to enforce the conditions attached to a reaffirmed master concept plan will lie with whoever files the covenant of unified control for that reaffirmation. 
(f)  Noncompliance. If the city discovers noncompliance with the regulations or the master concept plan and its attachments, the city may withhold any permit, certificate or license to construct, occupy or use any part of the planned development. This will not be construed to injure the rights of tenants of previously completed and properly occupied phases. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-378), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-301. - Binding nature of approval of master concept plan. 
    All terms, conditions, safeguards and stipulations made at the time of the approval of a master concept plan are binding upon the applicant or any successor in title or interest to all or part of the planned development. Departure from the approved plans or failure to comply with any requirement, condition or safeguard constitutes a violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-379), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-302. - Amendments to approved master concept plan. 
(a)  Amendments to an approved master concept plan or its attendant documentation may be requested at any time during the development of or useful life of a planned development. 
(b)  Amendments that may be approved by the director include, in general, any change to the interior of the development which does not increase density or intensity (i.e., number of dwelling units or quantity of commercial or industrial floor area), or decrease buffers or open space. The director may not approve a change which results in the substantial underutilization of public resources and public infrastructure committed to the support of the development. In addition, the director may not approve changes which result in a reduction of total open space, buffering, landscaping and preservation areas or which adversely impacts on surrounding land uses. 
(c)  All other requests for amendments to a master concept plan or its auxiliary documentation will treated procedurally as minor planned developments, but with application information and materials specified by section 4-295(a)(7). 
(d)  Any application for an amendment that proposes a development which, taken by itself, would constitute a major planned development (development of city impact see sections 4-195(b) and 4-272(b)(1)) may not be treated as a minor planned development unless it clearly meets the criteria set forth in section 4-272(b)(2). Otherwise, it must proceed as a new and separate major planned development. 
(e)  Notice of a plan amendment must be recorded in the same manner as the approved master concept plan itself. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-380), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-303. - Duration of rights conferred by adopted master concept plan. 
(a)  Duration of rights for planned developments. 
(1)  All development rights conferred by an adopted master concept plan are valid for five years from the date the planned development was approved by the city council, unless a greater time is approved for a development of regional impact (DRI). A master concept plan that is approved as part of a (DRI) is valid from the date the planned development was approved by the city council until the initial build out date provided in the DRI development order. 
(2)  An applicant must acquire a development order for a substantial portion of the project within five years of the date of the approval of the planned development, unless a greater time is approved in accordance with the provisions below. The development order must be submitted before the master concept plan expires. A substantial portion of the project is defined as no less than 20 percent of the lots, dwelling units, square feet, or other applicable measurements of intensity as applicable, unless a lesser percentage is approved by the city council. 
(3)  Master concept plans for planned developments that do not require development orders pursuant to chapter 3 are not subject to the time frames in this section. 
(4)  The duration of a master concept plan that is part of a development of regional impact DRI will be automatically extended if the DRIs phasing or build-out dates are extended. The MCP duration extension is limited to the length of the extension of the build-out date granted in the DRI. 
(b)  Status of expired master concept plans. When a master concept plan expires the property will remain zoned planned development, but no additional development can occur or be approved until a new master concept plan is approved in compliance with section 4-295 et seq.; the original master concept plan is reinstated in accordance with subsection (d) of this section; or the property is rezoned. 
(c)  Extensions of master concept plans through public hearing process. 
(1)  An approved master concept plan that is not vacated may be extended by the city council at a public hearing for one additional extension not to exceed four years; provided that: 
a.  The applicant submits a completed application form for extension (on a form provided by the community development) not more than one year and not fewer than 120 days prior to the date the current master concept plan vacates as provided in subsection (a) of this section together with the appropriate fee. The application must include, unless waived by the city council, at a minimum: 
1.  All submittal requirements for a public hearing pursuant to sections 4-193 and 4-194; 
2.  A copy of the approved master concept plan amended in accordance with section 4-299(b)(6) to reflect the uses, deviations and other modifications set forth in the approving ordinance (no changes may be made to the master concept plan); 
3.  A copy of the approved planned development zoning ordinance and all approved amendments; 
4.  A written statement describing how the criteria listed in subsection (c)(1)b. of this section have been met; 
5.  A current traffic impact statement (TIS) pursuant to section 4-295(a)(7); and 
6.  A detailed narrative explaining why the required development order is not approved and a chronology documenting that the required development order has been diligently pursued. 
7.  The director may require additional information as described in section 4-295 if necessary to review the request. 
The director may require additional information as described in section 4-295 if necessary to review the request. 
b.  The city council, after reviewing the recommendation of the staff, determines that: 
1.  The master concept plan is consistent with the Bonita Plan; 
2.  The master concept plan is compatible with existing and approved development; 
3.  There will be sufficient capacity for potable water, sanitary sewer, surface water management, solid waste disposal, parks and recreation, roadway facilities and public schools to serve the development at the time the impacts of the development will occur without causing these facilities and services to function at a level of service below the minimum regulatory levels established in the Bonita Plan; and 
4.  The reason the required development order is not approved is reasonably beyond the control of the applicant and the applicant is diligently pursuing approval of the required development order. 
(2)  Prior to granting any extension, the city council will review uses for compatibility with existing and approved development, and may remove uses or add conditions to make the use consistent with the Bonita Plan. The city council may approve, deny, or limit the requested extension to a period less than the applicant's request. The decision of the city council is discretionary. A master concept plan that has not received a development order and diligently pursued construction, prior to the master concept plan extension expiration, may not receive a second extension but must be reviewed in accordance with section 4-295 et seq. 
(d)  Reinstatement of master concept plans not permitted. 
(1)  An expired master concept plan or a phase of a master concept plan may only not be reinstated by the city council; unless an application was submitted to community development prior to August 1, 2017. Any application submitted before such date must meet former section 4-303(d) and will be processed in accordance with said section. The director may require additional information as described in section 4-295 if necessary to review the request.

DIVISION 3. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 4-325. - General standards. 
(a)  All planned developments shall be consistent with the provisions of the Bonita Plan. 
(b)  All planned developments, unless otherwise excepted, shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of all applicable city development regulations in force at that time. 
(c)  The tract or parcel proposed for development under this article must be located so as to minimize the negative effects of the resulting land uses on surrounding properties and the public interest generally, and must be of such size, configuration and dimension as to adequately accommodate the proposed structures, all required open space, including private recreational facilities and parkland, bikeways, pedestrian ways, buffers, parking, access, on-site utilities, including wet or dry runoff retention, and reservations of environmentally sensitive land or water. In large residential or commercial planned developments, the site planner is encouraged to create subunits, neighborhoods or internal communities which promote pedestrian and cyclist activity and community interaction. 
(d)  The tract or parcel shall have access to existing or proposed roads: 
(1)  In accordance with chapter 3 and as specified in the Bonita Plan traffic circulation element or the official trafficways map of the county; 
(2)  That have either sufficient existing capacity or the potential for expanded capacity to accommodate both the traffic generated by the proposed land use and that traffic expected from the background (through traffic plus that generated by surrounding land uses) at a level of service D or better on an annual average basis and level of service E or better during the peak season, except where higher levels of service on specific roads have been established in the Bonita Plan; and 
(3)  That provide ingress and egress without requiring site-related industrial traffic to move through predominantly residential areas. 
(e)  If within the Lee Tran public transit service area, the development shall be designed to facilitate the use of the transit system. 
(f)  Development and subsequent use of the planned development shall not create or increase hazards to persons or property, whether on or off the site, by increasing the probability or degree of flood, erosion or other danger, nor shall it impose a nuisance on surrounding land uses or the public's interest generally through emissions of noise, glare, dust, odor, air or water pollutants. 
(g)  Every effort shall be made in the planning, design and execution of a planned development to protect, preserve or to not unnecessarily destroy or alter natural, historical or archaeological features of the site, particularly mature native trees and other threatened or endangered native vegetation. Alteration of the vegetation or topography that unnecessarily disrupts the surface water or groundwater hydrology, increases erosion of the land, or destroys significant wildlife habitat is prohibited. That habitat is significant that is critical for the survival of rare, threatened or endangered species of flora or fauna. 
(h)  A fundamental principle of planned development design is the creative use of the open space requirement to produce an architecturally integrated human environment. This shall be coordinated with the achievement of other goals, e.g., the preservation or conservation of environmentally sensitive land and waters or archaeological sites. 
(i)  Site planning and design shall minimize any negative impacts of the planned development on surrounding land and land uses. 
(j)  Where a proposed planned development is surrounded by existing development or land use with which it is compatible and of an equivalent intensity of use, the design emphasis shall be on the integration of this development with the existing development, in a manner consistent with current regulation. 
(k)  Where the proposed planned development is surrounded by existing development or land use with which it is not compatible or which is of a significantly higher or lower intensity of use (plus or minus ten percent of the gross floor area per acre if a commercial or industrial land use, or plus or minus 20 percent of the residential density), or is surrounded by undeveloped land or water, the design emphasis will be to separate and mutually protect the planned development and its environs. 
(l)  In large residential or commercial planned developments, the site planner is encouraged to create subunits, neighborhoods or internal communities which promote pedestrian activity and community interaction. 
(m)  In order to enhance the viability and value of the resulting development, the designer shall ensure the internal buffering and separation of potentially conflicting uses within the planned development. 
(n)  Density or type of use, height and bulk of buildings and other parameters of intensity should vary systematically throughout the planned development. This is intended to permit the location of intense or obnoxious uses away from incompatible land uses at the planned development's perimeter, or, conversely, to permit the concentration of intensity where it is desirable, e.g., on a major road frontage or at an intersection. 
(o)  Unless otherwise provided for in this article, minimum parking and loading requirements shall be as set forth in article VI, divisions 25 and 26, of this chapter. Where it can be reasonably anticipated that specified land uses are generators of occasional peak demand for parking space, a portion of the required parking may be pervious or semi-pervious surfaces subject to the condition that it be constructed and maintained so as to prevent erosion of soil. In all cases, however, sufficient parking shall be provided to prevent the spilling over of parking demand onto adjacent properties or rights-of-way at times of peak demand. 
(p)  Joint use of parking by various land uses within the planned development may be permitted by special condition where it can be demonstrated or required that the demand for parking by the various uses will not conflict. Joint parking agreements between uses within and uses without the planned development shall be governed by agreement per general regulation (see section 4-1730), without exception. 
(q)  Internal consistency through sign control, architectural controls, uniform planting schedules and other similar controls is encouraged. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-411), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-326. - Deviations from general zoning regulations. 
(a)  Except where specifically suspended or preempted by alternative regulations in this article, or by special conditions adopted to the master concept plan, all general provisions of this chapter shall apply to any planned development. However, to provide design flexibility in developing land through this article, deviations from the general provisions of this chapter, as well as from any separate land development regulation or code, may be permitted where it can be demonstrated in the process of reviewing the concept plan that the planned development will be enhanced and that the intent of such regulations to protect health, safety and welfare will be served. Such deviations shall be set forth in a separate schedule in the application and be accompanied by documentation, including sample detail drawings illustrating how each deviation would operate to the benefit, or at least not to the detriment, of the public interest. Approved deviations shall be set forth as part of the documentation attached to the master concept plan. 
(b)  Deviations may be permitted by this procedure to general or specific standards set forth in this chapter, chapter 3 when specifically requested and approved on the master concept plan, and other development ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-412), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-327. - Density or intensity of use. 
    Density or intensity of use permitted in any planned development shall be determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the following: 
(1)  The range of density or the uses permitted or encouraged under the Bonita Plan at that location; 
(2)  The availability of adequate capacity of all public facilities and services (in order of precedence, roads, water, sewer, surface water management, public safety, schools and other public services); 
(3)  The level of public services to be provided by the development; and 
(4)  The nature of and the density and intensity of existing development surrounding the project. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-412), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-328. - Open space. 
(a)  For the purpose of calculating requirements for planned developments, the term "open space" is defined as follows: 
    Common open space means open space which is physically accessible to all residents of the development. 
    Open space has the meaning given such term in chapter 3. 
    Private open space means open space which is physically separated from the common open space and is accessible primarily from a building or unit to which it is appurtenant. 
(b)  Open space should be reasonably accessible to all dwelling units. 
(c)  Each lot, tract or outparcel shall meet or exceed the minimum open space percentage and size requirements of chapter 3. The minimum amount of open space for the total development area shall be no less than the minimum percentage required in chapter 3 for large projects, including indigenous vegetation preservation. A request may be made to assign minimum open space percentages to individual lots, tracts or outparcels which are different than those required by chapter 3; provided that: 
(1)  The sum of open space allocated to the individual lots, tracts, or outparcels shall be no less than the minimum percentage required in chapter 3 for the entire development area, including indigenous vegetation preservation. 
(2)  An open space table shall be inserted as part of the master concept plan which indicates the minimum amount of open space which each lot, tract or outparcel shall provide. 
(3)  Open space areas shall meet, at a minimum, the dimensional size requirements for open space as set forth for small or large projects, as applicable, in chapter 3. 
(4)  No lot, tract or outparcel shall provide less than ten percent open space. 
(5)  All such requests must be approved by the city council as part of the planned development rezoning. 
(d)  Unimproved open space, e.g., reserved conservation or preservation areas such as wetlands (see the comprehensive plan, as amended, or as further amended, renumbered or replaced), must be committed at the completion of the first phase. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-414), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-329. - Provision of public facilities and services. 
(a)  If, at the time of rezoning or final plan review, a proposed planned development is found to require the creation, enlargement or extension of any road or street, any public utility system or other public service provision: 
(1)  Notwithstanding concept plan approval, no permits for occupancy or use of the development, or phase thereof, shall be issued until such additional infrastructure is in place, or the service is available; 
(2)  The developer shall make provisions acceptable to the appropriate agency, utility or other service provider for offsetting any incremental increase in net cost of or premature and unprogrammed commitment of capital necessitated by the act or timing of the development; or 
(3)  The developer shall provide the necessary capital facilities and services in such a manner as to ensure their continuous operation and maintenance for the near and long term, in accordance with the standards set by the appropriate local, regional, state and federal agencies. 
(b)  The requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to credits or additional conditions as specified in other city ordinances. 
(c)  Each and every planned development approved after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and all previous planned developments with resolutions containing a condition requiring payment of road impact fees, shall be subject to the following standard condition: If chapter 2, article VI, division 2, pertaining to road impact fees, is ever repealed or rescinded or otherwise becomes of no force and effect, the developer or property owner or successor of the developer or property owner shall pay an amount of road impact fees equivalent to that required by chapter 2, article VI, division 2, or the specific amount of mitigation required by the resolution, or provide alternative mitigation acceptable to the director. The amount of the fee shall be determined as of the date chapter 2, article VI, division 2, is repealed or rescinded or otherwise becomes of no force and effect. All planned development ordinances adopted after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived (December 3, 1990) shall contain the language of the condition listed in this subsection.

Sec. 4-347. - Installation of improvements; responsibility for costs of public services. 
    In order for a proposed planned development in rural or outer islands to be approved at a density above the standard density range, the property owner or land developer shall demonstrate that the development is in compliance with the following performance standards: 
(1)  All internal improvements, including, but not limited to, water, sewer, roads, water management and recreational areas, shall be installed to city standards or specifications at the developer's expense. 
(2)  The property owner or land developer shall pay for all of the capital costs of all off-site improvements and services required by the project. This payment of capital costs may include, but shall not be limited to, impact fees, special taxing districts (this does not include municipal services taxing units), capital construction, operation and maintenance funds, in lieu of fees, and dedication of land and facilities. 
(3)  The property owner or land developer must clearly demonstrate that the operation and maintenance costs of the project will not be borne by the city. The establishment of a homeowners' association or other legally responsible organization or arrangement may be utilized to bear the responsibility for operation and maintenance costs.

(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-611), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-400. - Types and general purpose of districts. 
(a)  There are two basic types of zoning districts provided for in this article: conventional zoning districts and planned development districts. The general purpose of both types of zoning districts is to implement the goals, objectives and policies of the Bonita Plan, as well as to provide protection to the public health, safety and welfare through the regulation of land use. 
(1)  Conventional districts. Conventional zoning districts are districts within the city within which land use is controlled through the regulation of the height and bulk of buildings and structures, the minimum area and dimensions of lots, the percentage of lot coverage, minimum open space and yard areas, through the use of setback requirements, the density of population, and the type and intensity of use of the land and buildings. Use and development regulations for the conventional districts are provided in divisions 2 through 8 of this article. 
(2)  PD, planned development districts. The purpose and intent of the various planned development districts is to further implement the goals, objectives and policies of the Bonita Plan while providing some degree of flexibility in planning and designing developments by: 
a.  Facilitating state-of-the-art site planning in order to improve the quality of the built environment and to ensure the most economical use of land and public resources; 
b.  Stimulating, where appropriate, the integration of new development with surrounding land uses, providing for consistency and visual harmony through various techniques, including screening and buffering, sign control, architectural controls and landscape design; 
c.  Encouraging multiple or mixed use development strategies, including the use of several housing types, the provision of several uses in combination such as residential and neighborhood commercial, office and light industry, and other analogous combinations; 
d.  Promoting improved and unifying design techniques that reduce dependence on vehicular movement within the development, encourage the use of joint parking and loading facilities, provide for joint access, and generally maintain adequate service and facilities while avoiding negative impacts on surrounding land use and traffic circulation; 
e.  Encouraging patterns of land use that support more economical provision of infrastructure; 
f.  Providing a mechanism by which the preservation or conservation of historic or natural resources and environmental amenities, including open space, may be ensured; 
g.  Providing a mechanism for offsetting any increased cost of the premature commitment of capital by any public utility or service provider through developer donations and dedications of capital, through private provisions and operation of services and facilities, or through a system of impact fees; 
h.  Providing a process and record on which developers, public officials, the general public and the consumers of development may rely; and 
i.  Providing for the protection and preservation of historic resources through reuse, sensitive adaptive use, compatible design and rehabilitation. 
(b)  Use and development regulations for planned development districts are provided in division 9 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-612), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-401. - Zoning maps; designation of district boundaries; vested rights. 
(a)  The boundaries of each zoning district as they were officially adopted from 1991 through 1994 are designated and established as shown on the official zoning map of the county prior to incorporation of Bonita Springs. Amendments officially approved by the city council since the adoption of the most recent official zoning maps are shown on the current zoning map described in section 4-402. Both the official zoning map and the current zoning map are a part of this chapter as if fully described in this chapter. 
(b)  There is no right to rely on either the official or current zoning maps to vest development or private rights. Staff members and members of the public must consult the pertinent zoning ordinances or resolutions, decisions for special exceptions or variances, and administrative approvals or deviations to determine the parameters and conditions affecting the subject property. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-613), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-402. - Official zoning map. 
(a)  Description.

(f)  Unauthorized changes to the official zoning maps. Changes to the official zoning map may only be made as provided for in subsection (c) of this section. No one may acquire any interest or right in property or personalty from an unauthorized change in the official zoning map. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-614), 1-19-2011) 
*A copy of this map is available to the public and on file in the city clerk's office. 

Sec. 4-403. - Current zoning maps. 
(a)  Description. The current zoning maps of the city consist of computer-generated section maps depicting the same information on the official zoning map as it may be subsequently modified by zoning amendments, special exceptions, variance or administrative deviations, etc., and mapping corrections that have been entered into the computer database since the most recent adoption of the official zoning maps which is on file in the city clerk's office. 
(b)  Public availability. The current zoning maps are part of the public records. 
(c)  Preparation. The city council hereby authorizes the preparation of current zoning maps in conformance with the procedures set forth in this section. 
(1)  Current zoning maps are scaled, computer-generated maps. 
(2)  Printed copies of the current zoning map that are provided as part of a public records or zoning verification letter request must contain the following statement: "This map represents the official zoning map and all district boundary changes, special exceptions, zoning variances and administrative amendments approved as of ________ (date)." 
(3)  The boundaries of each district will be shown on the current zoning map, and the district symbols will be used to designate each district. 
(4)  For mapping purposes only, a zoning district boundary line may be drawn to the centerline of a street, stream or river, or to the shoreline of a stream, river or other body of water, and all existing streets or bodies of water within such district may be included within such district without delineation of the streets or bodies of water. 
(5)  Official changes to the current zoning map will be entered into the computer database in the following manner: 
a.  The district boundary change will be entered into the database and will indicate the new district designation, as well as a symbol referencing additional zoning information. 
b.  The additional zoning information may include the city council zoning ordinance number, what the change of districts was and any special conditions. 
(6)  All approved special exceptions or variances and all appropriate administrative approvals and deviations will be noted as follows: 
a.  The property in question will be marked with a reference symbol directing the reader to additional zoning information; 
b.  The additional information may include the case number, type of action taken (i.e., special exception or variance) and special conditions and the administrative approval or deviation reference number. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-615), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-404. - Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. 
    When uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts of the official or current zoning map, the following rules apply: 
(1)  Boundaries following centerlines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways or alleys will be construed to follow such centerlines. 
(2)  Boundaries following lot, section or tract lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, section lines or tract lines will be construed as following such lot lines. 
(3)  Boundaries following municipal boundaries. Boundaries indicated as approximately following municipal boundaries will be construed as following such municipal boundaries. 
(4)  Boundaries following railroad lines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following railroad lines will be construed to be the centerline of the railroad right-of-way. 
(5)  Boundaries following shorelines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers or canals will be construed to follow such centerlines. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines will be construed to follow such shorelines as indicated on the aerial photography flown for the county in 1984. In the event of change in the shoreline due to natural causes, land created through accretion will automatically be classified as EC until and unless a zoning district change is applied for and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(6)  Parallel lines. Boundaries that are approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, the centerlines or alley lines of alleys, or the centerline or right-of-way lines of highways will be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning maps. If no distance is given, such dimension will be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning maps. 
(7)  Vacated lands. Where a public road, street, alley or other form of right-of-way is officially vacated the regulations applicable to the property to which the vacated lands attach will also apply to such vacated lands. 
(8)  Excluded areas. 
a.  Where parcels of land and water areas have been annexed or revert to the city in any manner, such parcels will be classified in accordance with F.S. § 171.062, unless or until rezoned pursuant to current regulations. 
b.  Where land accretes through natural processes, the land will be classified as an EC zoning district unless or until rezoned pursuant to current regulations. 
(9)  Uncertainties. Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official or current zoning map, or in case any other uncertainty exists as to the proper location of district boundaries, the director will interpret the intent of the official or current zoning map as to the proper location of the district boundaries. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-616), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-405. - District conversions. 
(a)  The 1986 zoning ordinance effective on August 1, 1986, contained a chart (section 400.04) which converted existing zoning districts and some select areas to the new districts incorporated in the revised ordinance. For historical purposes only, this conversion chart is retained as subsection (d) of this section. 
(b)  Upon the effective date of Ordinance No. 93-24 (September 27, 1993), all land currently zoned RM-14 was converted to RM-2.

DIVISION 4. - RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARK DISTRICTS 
Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 4-576. - General purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose and intent of the recreational vehicle park districts is to provide regulations for existing recreational parks which were lawfully established under state or county regulations prior to September 16, 1985. 
(b)  It is the intent of this chapter that: 
(1)  Except as provided for in sections 4-577(1) and 4-605, no recreational vehicle shall be used as a yearround residence; 
(2)  All new recreational vehicle development and all expansion of existing recreational vehicle developments shall be permitted only as recreational vehicle planned developments (see division 9 of this article); and 
(3)  Any lawfully existing recreational vehicle development that cannot conform to any of the conventional recreational vehicle districts set forth in this division may apply for a recreational vehicle planned development so as to resolve issues of nonconformity on a development-wide rather than on an individual basis. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-761), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-577. - General regulations. 
    The following regulations are applicable to all existing and new recreational vehicle parks: 
(1)  Permanent residency prohibited. The use of a recreational vehicle type unit by a permanent resident as a permanent residence, as the terms are defined in F.S. ch. 196, is expressly prohibited as of September 16, 1985. Persons who have established permanent residency within a recreational vehicle park as of September 16, 1985, are exempt from the residency provisions of this section, provided that the proof of residency was established by an affidavit filed with the county prior to October 31, 1985. 
(2)  Tiedowns. 
a.  All of the following recreational vehicles shall be properly tied down in accordance with the standards set forth in F.S. § 320.8325 and Ordinance No. 90-23, as may be amended from time to time, whichever is applicable, as follows: 
1.  All permanent units. 
2.  All travel trailers, motor homes or camping trailers left unattended for more than two weeks during the months of June through December. For purposes of this section only, the term "unattended" shall be interpreted to mean that the owner of the unit has not provided for a person to be responsible for the unit in the event of a hurricane watch alert as set forth in subsection (2)b of this section. 
b.  All travel trailers, motor homes or camping trailers shall be tied down within 48 hours of the issuance of a hurricane watch for the county by the National Hurricane Center. Travel trailers, motor homes or camping trailers not tied down shall be removed within 48 hours of such a hurricane watch, or placed within an approved off-lot storage area. 
(3)  Emergency shelters. New or phased recreational vehicle developments will be required to provide an emergency shelter in accordance with the provisions of section 3-265. 
(4)  Recreational vehicle storage facilities. Off-lot storage of recreational vehicles shall be allowed for periods of non-occupancy in recreational vehicle parks; provided, however, all such storage shall comply with the following: 
a.  Off-lot storage areas shall provide a continuous visual screen of at least eight feet in height along any lot line abutting a residential use under separate ownership, and along any street right-of-way. 
b.  Off-lot storage areas shall comply with all other applicable regulations contained in this chapter. 
c.  All storage areas presently in existence and use which are in noncompliance with any provision set forth in this section shall be brought into compliance within one year from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
d.  The area of the off-lot storage shall be limited to ten percent of the total area of the recreational park.

Secs. 4-578-4-602. - Reserved. 
Subdivision II. - Conventional Recreational Vehicle Districts 

Sec. 4-603. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose and intent of the conventional recreational vehicle district is to accommodate existing developed or phased recreational vehicle parks which were lawfully constructed in compliance with state and local laws prevailing at the time of development. 
(b)  The conventional recreational vehicle districts include, and are limited to, two subdistricts based upon the minimum required lot size (recreational vehicle site) at the time of development. The two subdistricts are further categorized as transient or nontransient, or a combination of both. 
(c)  It is the intent of this division that all existing developed and phased parks will be rezoned into one or both subdistricts where possible. Any park which does not fall within a subdistrict shall be required to apply for an RVPD zoning or remain as a nonconforming park subject to the provisions for nonconformities. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-781), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-604. - Subdistricts and subtypes. 
(a)  Subdistricts. All existing recreational vehicle parks which meet the definition of a developed or phased vehicle park shall be classified into one or more of the recreational vehicle subdistricts based upon the period of time in which they were developed. (See section 4-614, pertaining to property development regulations.) 
(b)  Subtypes. The subtype of a park indicates the predominant use (transient or non-transient) of the park, or portion of the park, as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, and establishes regulations for accessory uses which may or may not be permitted within the park. The subtype shall be noted on the official zoning map at the time of rezoning. Park subtypes are as follows: 
(1)  Type A (transient). Parks which are predominately operated as transient parks and in which individual sites are rented or leased for relatively short periods of time (six months or less). 
(2)  Type B (non-transient). Parks which are predominately operated as non-transient parks and in which individual sites were lawfully subdivided, platted, recorded or otherwise approved by the city council prior to the city incorporation. Individual sites may be rented or leased, owned by individuals, or part of a condominium, cooperative or other similar arrangement. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-782), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-605. - Applicability of use and property development regulations; prohibited uses.

No recreational vehicle shall be used for other than temporary living quarters except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  Any use not specifically enumerated in section 4-613 is hereby prohibited in an RV district. Additionally, in the RV district, there is expressly prohibited the use of a recreational vehicle type unit by a permanent resident as a permanent residence, as the terms are defined in F.S. ch. 196, as of September 16, 1985. Persons who have established permanent residency within a recreational vehicle park as of September 16, 1985, are exempt from the residency provisions of this subsection, provided that the proof of residency was established by an affidavit filed with the county within 45 days of September 16, 1985.

Secs. 4-636-4-658. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 6. - COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 4-659. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Generally. The purpose and intent of the conventional commercial districts is to regulate the continuance of certain land uses and structures lawfully existing as of August 1, 1986, which were originally permitted by the county zoning regulations of 1962, as amended, or 1978, as amended, and to encourage and guide new commercial development in accordance with the goals, objectives and policies set forth in the Bonita Plan. Commercial development shall be permitted where requisite infrastructure exists or can feasibly be extended. Subsequent to August 1, 1986, with the exception of rezonings to recognize and accommodate existing developments, no parcel of land of ten or more acres in size shall be rezoned to any of the conventional commercial districts. 
(b)  C-1A, C-1 and C-2 commercial districts. The purpose and intent of the C-1A, C-1 and C-2 districts is to regulate the continuance of commercial and select residential land uses and structures lawfully existing in the C-1A, C-1 and C-2 districts as of August 1, 1986, and as originally permitted by the county zoning regulations of 1962, as amended, and 1978, as amended, respectively. Subsequent to February 4, 1978, no land or water shall be rezoned into the C-1A, C-1 or C-2 districts. In no case shall new development be permitted in any existing C-1A, C-1 or C-2 district which is not consistent with the Bonita Plan. 
(c)  C-2A commercial district. The purpose and intent of the C-2A district is to recognize and provide for the continuation of most commercial and residential uses as set forth in the C-2 zoning district use regulations but prohibiting the industrial and manufacturing uses permitted by the C-2 district. This district is not available to landowners through normal procedures, but shall be used only by the city council on its own initiative to achieve the purpose stated in this subsection. 
(d)  CN-1 neighborhood commercial district. The purpose and intent of the CN-1 district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for small-scale commercial facilities within or adjacent to areas or neighborhoods which are essentially residential in nature, and to facilitate their proper development and use. It is anticipated that locating small retail and service establishments in close proximity to low to moderate-density residential land uses will encourage pedestrian activity and otherwise reduce the number and length of automobile trips, as well as providing increased convenience to all users. It is further intended that substantial buffering and other design techniques shall be used to prevent negative impacts on nearby or adjacent residential or lower-intensity land uses. 
(e)  CN-2 neighborhood commercial district. The purpose and intent of the CN-2 district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for consumer-oriented commercial facilities of moderate scale, including neighborhood shopping centers, and to facilitate their proper development and use. Such facilities include the functions of CN-1 commercial places, but the greater floor area and the broader mix of goods and services available results in a wider market or service area, a larger population served, and a greater impact on surrounding land uses. The primary uses provided for include retail trade in food, drugs, sundries, hardware and similar items, and the provision of personal services. 
(f)  CC community commercial district. The purpose and intent of the CC district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for medium to large-scale consumer-oriented commercial facilities, particularly for multiple-occupancy complexes known as community or regional shopping centers, and to facilitate their proper development and use. In addition to the retail sale of consumer goods, this district is intended to permit a wide range of services, financial and other, including business and professional offices, all arranged in discrete commercial centers or evolving business districts. Such centers or districts differ from neighborhood commercial facilities in concentrating a greater floor area of use and a broader mix of goods and services in order to serve a wider market or service area and a larger population. This is expected to create greater impact on surrounding land uses and therefore require buffering and designed gradients of intensity adjacent to less intense uses. 
(g)  CG general commercial district. The purpose and intent of the CG district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for and to facilitate the proper development and use of consumer-oriented commercial facilities which are of a type or scale which are not suited for and do not generally seek locations in neighborhood, community or regional shopping centers. Such uses frequently consist of a single principal building containing sales, administration, repair services or manufacture; often rely on large ground areas for storage or display of goods; and are relatively insensitive to the impacts of adjacent land uses while generating substantial impacts on their neighbors. High visual exposure and easy accessibility, usually from arterial roads or suburban highways, are important. 
(h)  CS-1 special commercial office district. The purpose and intent of the CS-1 district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for and to facilitate the proper development and use of land for standard office space for various purposes, and a minimum level of retail sales and personal services required to provide convenient access to goods and services for the workforce and clientage. While it is recognized that such uses will demand easy access from arterial or high-volume collector roads, this district is intended to be used to separate and buffer residential and other low- or medium-intensity land uses, such as schools or parks, from higher-intensity commercial and light industrial land uses. 
(i)  CS-2 special commercial office district. The purpose and intent of the CS-2 district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for the proper development of standard office space for various purposes, as well as a number of other low-impact uses that can be allowed by special exception in particular circumstances. This district is intended to be used to separate and buffer residential and other low- or medium-intensity land uses, such as schools or parks, from higher-intensity commercial and light industrial land uses. 
(j)  CT tourist commercial district. The purpose and intent of the CT district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for and to facilitate the proper development and use of land for the commercial provision of accommodations and services for tourists and other visitors and short-term or seasonal residents. The term "accommodations," as used in this subsection, is intended to include housing, various amenities, including recreational facilities, and local retail trade in goods and services, both general and specific to the locality or attractor or principal activities. Areas designated tourist commercial are expected to be located near or adjacent to an attractor of tourism such as gulf beach frontage, theme parks, major public or private parks and other recreational or scenic resources.

Sec. 4-660. - Applicability of use and property development regulations. 
    No land, body of water or structure may be used or permitted to be used and no structure may hereafter be erected, constructed, moved, altered or maintained in any conventional commercial district for any purpose other than as provided in section 4-661, pertaining to use regulations for conventional commercial districts, and section 4-662, pertaining to property development regulations for conventional commercial districts, except as may be specifically provided for in article VII (nonconformities) of this chapter, or in section 4-406.

DIVISION 8. - I INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 4-716. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Generally. The purpose and intent of the industrial districts is to regulate the continuance of certain land uses and structures lawfully existing as of August 1, 1986, which were originally permitted by the county zoning regulations of 1962, as amended, or 1978, as amended. It is also the purpose and intent of the industrial districts to encourage industrial growth in accordance with the goals, objectives and policies set forth in the Bonita Plan, and to guide most industrial growth into areas where required infrastructure exists or can be feasibly extended. 
(b)  It is the intent of this chapter that any proposed industrial development which requires a rezoning, and which meets or exceeds one or more of the following criteria, must be rezoned only to an IPD industrial planned development: 
(1)  Any development exceeding the thresholds set out in section 4-203. 
(2)  Any development involving the manufacturing of the following products, regardless of the land area involved: 
a.  Chemicals and allied products Groups I and II (excluding cosmetics, perfumes, etc.) (section 4-408(c)(6)). 
b.  Fabricated metal products Group I (section 4-408(c)(14)). 
c.  Lumber and wood products Groups V and VI (section 4-408(c)(25)). 
d.  Paper and allied products Group I (section 4-408(c)(30)). 
e.  Petroleum manufacturing (section 4-408(c)(33)). 
f.  Primary metal industries (section 4-408(c)(34)). 
g.  Research and development laboratories Group III (section 4-408(c)(40)). 
h.  Rubber and plastic products Group I (section 4-408(c)(43)). 
i.  Stone, clay, glass and concrete products Group IV (section 4-408(c)(47)). 
j.  Textile mill products Group III (section 4-408(c)(49)). 
(3)  Refuse and trash dumps. 
(4)  Sanitary landfills. 
(5)  Salvage yards or junkyards. 
(6)  Auto wrecking yards. 
(7)  Resource recovery facilities to produce energy. 
(c)  IL light industrial district. The purpose and intent of the IL district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for and to facilitate the proper development and use of areas devoted to various light industrial and quasi-industrial commercial uses. While it is presumed that most industrial processes will take place within enclosed buildings, any activity not taking place within a building shall take place within a yard enclosed by an opaque wall or fence. 
(d)  IG general industrial district. The purpose and intent of the IG district is to permit the designation of suitable locations for and to facilitate the proper development and use of areas devoted to various heavy industrial uses which have the potential of producing extensive adverse impacts on surrounding land uses or resources. Such uses include those which produce noise, odors or increased hazards of fire, or are generally incompatible with lower-intensity land uses. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-901), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-717. - Applicability of use and property development regulations. 
    No land, body of water or structure may be used or permitted to be used and no structure may hereafter be erected, constructed, moved, altered or maintained in the industrial districts for any purpose other than as provided in section 4-718, pertaining to use regulations for industrial districts, and section 4-719, pertaining to property development regulations for industrial districts, except as may be specifically provided for in article VII (nonconformities) of this chapter, or in section 4-406.

(b)  Special conditions may be formulated and applied to address unique aspects of the parcel in the protection of a bona fide public interest. The source of such restrictions may include good planning practice as well as those specifications set forth in the application documents, policy and standards set forth in the Bonita Plan. 
(c)  All special conditions shall be reasonably related to the proposed development and to any reasonably expected impacts on public services and facilities and the public safety, health and general welfare. Such special conditions should be pertinent to the mitigation of these impacts. All conditions shall be adopted as part of the zoning resolution and as an appendix to the approved master concept plan which governs the planned development. 
(d)  The standards for use and development of a planned development shall be set forth in the documentation attached to the master concept plan, and, unless modified through the schedule of deviations, where applicable (see section 4-326), such standards shall not be less restrictive than the minimum standards set forth elsewhere in this chapter or other applicable development regulations. 
(e)  Areas devoted to various uses shall be designated on the concept plan. The application for a planned development shall include a schedule detailing the uses desired, identifying such uses by citing the enumerated uses of one or more conventional zoning districts, use activity groups (section 4-408), and defined uses (section 4-2).

Sec. 4-741. - Property development regulations. 
(a)  Minimum area for planned developments. 
(1)  Recreational vehicle planned developments. The minimum area required for a new recreational vehicle planned development is 20 acres. A minimum of five acres is required to expand an existing recreational vehicle park, a phased recreational vehicle park or an approved recreational vehicle planned development in order to provide additional recreation vehicle units to the park. However, a recreational vehicle park, a phased recreational vehicle park or an approved recreational vehicle planned development can be expanded by less than five acres, if the expansion is solely for the purpose of providing amenities to the park and will not result in creating additional recreational vehicle units. 
(2)  Other planned developments. Minimum area and dimensions are not specified for other planned developments. However, the net developable land remaining, after deleting any environmentally sensitive lands and waters, must be of such size, configuration and dimension as to adequately accommodate the proposed structures, parking, access, onsite utilities, including wet or dry runoff retention, all required open space, including buffers, and similar spatial requirements. 
(b)  Minimum setbacks of structures and buildings from development perimeter boundaries. 
(1)  All buildings and structures must be set back from the development perimeter a distance equal to the greater of: 
a.  The width of any buffer area or landscape strip, required by chapter 3; 
b.  Fifteen feet, if the subject property is, or will be zoned RPD, MHPD, CFPD, or CPD; 
c.  Fifteen feet for residential and commercial portions of the development, if the subject property is, or will be zoned MPD; or 25 feet for industrial portions of the development, if the subject property is, or will be MPD; 
d.  Twenty-five feet, if the subject property is, or will be zoned IPD; 
e.  One-half the height of the building or structure; 
f.  The setback from road, street or drive as appropriate (see section 4-1893), if the development perimeter abuts a street right-of-way or easement; or 
g.  Forty feet, if the subject property is, or will be zoned RVPD unless abutting land zoned RV or RVPD. 
(2)  Parking or internal roads or drives may not be closer to the development perimeter than the width of any buffer area or landscape strip, required by chapter 3 or five feet, whichever is greater. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section all buildings, parking areas, and shipping and receiving areas and open storage areas of industrial land uses within a CPD, IPD or MPD, must be set back in accordance with section 4-2012 et seq. or 100 feet, whichever is greater, from the development perimeter where the planned development abuts a residential land use or land zoned exclusively for residential uses. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section, when a proposed development will abut an existing residential subdivision or residential lots, the requirements set forth in section 3-418(d)(6) must be satisfied. 
(5)  The provisions of this subsection notwithstanding, the city council may require greater setbacks and buffers when, in its opinion, they are necessary for the protection of public health, welfare or safety. 
(c)  Uses permitted within required perimeter setback. Street stubs required by chapter 3, bikeways and pedestrian walks, sidewalks, jogging and equestrian paths, and park furniture, including gazebos and picnic shelters, are permitted within required perimeter setbacks. 
(d)  Minimum lot size, dimensions and setbacks. 
(1)  Lot size and dimensions. 
a.  In the RPD and MHPD districts, if the development contains or consists of a conventional subdivision for single-family residences, two-family or duplex structures or mobile homes, the lot dimensions and areas specified in section 4-489 for the RSA, RS-1, RS-2, RS-3, RS-4, RS-5 and TF-1 single-family and two-family districts or in section 4-556 for the MH-1 or MH-2 mobile home districts shall apply as appropriate, unless other lot areas and dimensions are approved by the city council. 
b.  Where the master concept plan calls for dwelling units on individual lots in clusters or townhouse configurations, the specific lot areas and dimensions shall be determined by the space requirements of the unit itself, the provision of private open space and the voluntary reservation of additional common open space, if any. 
(2)  Setbacks for residential buildings and mobile homes. Setbacks from lot lines and separation of buildings for residential buildings and mobile homes in residential planned developments and mobile home planned developments shall be determined as follows: 
a.  If the development contains or consists of a subdivision for single-family detached or duplex structures or mobile homes, the front, side and rear setbacks specified in section 4-489 for the RSA, RS-1, RS-2, RS-3, RS-4, RS-5 and TF-1 single-family and two-family districts or in section 4-556 for the MH-1 or MH-2 mobile home district shall apply as appropriate, unless other lot areas and dimensions are approved by the city council. 
b.  Where the master concept plan calls for single-family detached or attached zero lot line housing, each dwelling unit structure may have one wall without windows or doors on a side lot line, may encroach with eaves or cornice no more than 36 inches into the adjacent yard, and shall maintain at least a minimum separation from the building or mobile home on the side opposite the zero setback line consistent with the standard set forth in subsection (d)(2)c of this section. 
c.  Where the master concept plan calls for clustering of single-family detached structures or mobile homes, and so long as sufficient separation is maintained to prevent the spread of fire, and so long as adequate access is provided for emergency services as certified by the fire official, the separation of buildings may be reduced to no less than ten feet. 
(3)  Setbacks for buildings in commercial planned developments, industrial planned developments and mixed use planned development. 
a.  If the development contains or consists of a subdivision for development parcels to be sold or leased as improved land for further development for commercial, industrial or multifamily residential purposes, where permitted, side and rear setbacks for all lots shall be scheduled on the master concept plan, except that, where a lot line is congruent with the development perimeter, the setback defined in subsection (b) of this section shall have priority. 
b.  The setbacks from internal streets shall be determined by the functional classification of the streets as set forth in section 4-1893. 
(4)  Minimum separation of buildings. Unless otherwise specified, where there are two or more principal buildings on a development tract, the minimum separation of buildings shall be one-half of the sum of their heights, or 20 feet, whichever is greater. 
(e)  Height of buildings. 
(1)  Bonita Beach Road Corridor. 
a.  Bonita Beach Road Corridor west of U.S. 41. No building or structure may exceed 45 feet in height*, unless all side setbacks are increased 12 inches for each 12 inches by which the height exceeds 45 feet. In no event, may the height exceed 55 feet unless a variance or deviation is approved by the city council as part of a mixed use development. 
b.  Bonita Beach Road Corridor east of U.S. 41. No building or structure may exceed 55 feet in height* unless all required setbacks are increased 12 inches for each 12 inches by which the height exceeds 55 feet.

c.  Other planned developments. Except as restricted by section 4-1874, height of buildings in all other planned developments will vary in accordance with the land use classification of the subject property according to the Future Land Use Map of Bonita Springs contained within the comprehensive plan. 
(f)  Open space. See section 4-328(a) for definitions pertaining to open space. 
(1)  Residential and mobile home planned developments. 
a.  In the residential or mobile home planned development districts, 40 percent of the total area of the project shall be common open space, except that this may be reduced to 30 percent when the remaining ten percent is distributed as private open space to individual dwelling units having immediate private ground floor access. Additional land or water may be reserved as open space at the developer's discretion. 
b.  No additional open space is required in the accessory commercial area beyond landscaped buffering, as required elsewhere in this chapter. 
c.  The common open space requirements set forth in subsection (g)(1)a of this section do not apply to developments consisting of a conventional subdivision for single-family detached or two-family (duplex) dwelling units or mobile homes on lots of standard dimensions. 
(2)  Community facilities planned developments. In the community facilities planned development district, not less than 30 percent of the total area of the project shall be common open space. 
(3)  Commercial planned developments. Open space shall be required in accordance with chapter 3. 
(4)  Industrial planned developments. 
a.  In the industrial planned development district, open space shall be provided in accordance with chapter 3. Additional land or water may be reserved as open space at the developer's discretion. 
b.

Subdivision III. - PUD Planned Unit Development District 

Sec. 4-827. - Applicability. 
(a)  The PUD planned unit development district is intended to recognize and provide for those developments which had received preliminary or final approval as a planned unit development or which had been scheduled for a PUD hearing before the local planning agency prior to September 30, 1985. Subsequent to September 30, 1985, no application for preliminary approval of a development of a planned unit development shall be accepted. 
(b)  Certain sections of the PUD district regulations are hereby retained so as to allow completion of these developments which have received preliminary approval prior to August 1, 1986. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1031), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-828. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the intent of this subdivision to establish a planned unit development (PUD) zoning district in an effort to: 
(1)  Encourage developers to exercise greater ingenuity and imagination in the planning and development or redevelopment of tracts of land under unified control than generally is possible under this chapter; 
(2)  Allow a diversification of uses, structures and open areas in a manner compatible with both the surrounding existing and approved development of land surrounding and abutting the PUD site; 
(3)  Provide a means for land to be used more efficiently, and for utilization of smaller networks of utilities and streets; 
(4)  Retain the natural amenities of land by encouraging scenic and functional open space within the PUD; and 
(5)  Give the developer reasonable assurance of approval of a PUD application before he expends complete design monies, while providing the city with assurances that the PUD will be developed according to approved specifications.

Sec. 4-834. - Changes to final development plan. 
(a)  The director of community development may approve those minor changes specifically allowed pursuant to an approved final PUD development plan for a PUD. For any approved final PUD development plan for a PUD which does not specifically set forth those minor changes that may be approved by the director of community development or any PUD development plan which has not received final approval prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this subdivision is derived (July 6, 1987), minor changes (amendments) that may be approved by the community development director include, in general, any change to the interior of the development which does not increase density or intensity (i.e., number of dwelling units or quantity of commercial or industrial floor area), or which does not decrease buffers or open space. The director shall not approve any change which results in a substantial underutilization of public resources and public infrastructure committed to the support of the development, nor shall the director approve any change which results in a reduction of total open space, buffering, landscaping and preservation areas, or which adversely impacts on surrounding land uses. 
(b)  Any other changes or amendments to the approved final development plan for a PUD not authorized pursuant to this section shall only be approved by the city council after public hearing. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1038), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-835. - Amendments to built planned unit developments. 
(a)  Any part or all of a planned unit development (PUD) which is built may be the subject of an application for a variance, special exception or other approval covered by this chapter wherein the subject property is the only part of the original (PUD) for which the approval is sought. If the subject property meets the threshold for a development of city impact, it must be reviewed in accordance with the provisions in this chapter which apply to developments of city impact. If the subject property is not a development of city impact, it will be reviewed in accordance with the provisions in this chapter which apply to conventional zoning districts. In either case, the applicant must be the owner of the property and the consent of the owners of the remainder of the original (PUD) is unnecessary. However, these owners must be given notice of the application and other proceedings as if they were owners of property abutting the subject property regardless of their actual proximity to the subject property. 
(b)  For purposes of this section, the term "built" means that the roads, utilities, buffering, open space, surface water management features and structures, common space, common amenities, common landscaping, gatehouses, entrance signs, entrance ways and other similar items identified as part of the final approved master concept plan have been constructed and acknowledged by the city as complete. In the case of (PUDs) which include residential structures, the term "built" does not mean that all residential structures have been constructed on individual platted lots.

(l)  Adjustments to base number of dwelling units permitted. Under certain conditions, adjustments may be made or required to be made to the base number of dwelling units permitted in a PUD when the preliminary and final approval are given, or subsequent to approval. 
(1)  Decreases in the base number of dwelling units permitted may be required if it has been determined that the calculated base number would: 
a.  Create inconvenient or unsafe access to the PUD; 
b.  Create traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin or lead to the PUD; 
c.  Place an undue burden on streets, utilities, schools and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the PUD; 
d.  Be in conflict with the intent or provisions of the Bonita Plan; or 
e.  Create a threat to property or incur abnormal public expense in areas subject to natural hazards.

The shared parking factor for two functions, when divided into the sum of the two amounts as listed on the required parking table, produces the effective parking needed for each site involved in sharing. Conversely, if the sharing factor is used as a multiplier, it indicates the amount of building allowed on each site given the parking available. 

(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1151), 1-19-2011; Ord. No. 13-01, § 1(4-1151), 2-6-2013; Ord. No. 13-09, § 1(4-1151), 8-7-2013) 
Sec. 4-867. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The Old U.S. 41 Corridor Redevelopment Overlay District is a special zoning classification established to recognize and provide for the unique requirements of redevelopment that cannot be adequately addressed through existing regulations. The purpose of the district is to create favorable conditions for the revitalization of redevelopment areas, or portions thereof, by establishing a procedure through which such areas should be master planned. The master planning includes development guidelines and standards that are intended to provide an incentive-driven alternative to the standard zoning and other land development regulations in exchange for enhanced lighting, landscaping, signage and architectural design standards. The policies contained within this subdivision are intended to encourage redevelopment, interconnectivity, pedestrian activity, and to achieve and maintain a unique, unified and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality in landscaping, architecture, signage. 
(b)  It is the express policy of the city council that development within the Old U.S. 41 Corridor Redevelopment Overlay district is to be consistent with the city comprehensive plan and the Old U.S. 41 Master Plan. 
(c)  The city has adopted the Old U.S. 41 Corridor Redevelopment Master Plan and re-designated the area previously known as the Old U.S. 41 Town Center Mixed-Use Redevelopment Overlay Area. This area is intended for mixed-use redevelopment as a residential, commercial, cultural and community, hospitality, recreational and governmental center focused around the aesthetic and recreational value of the Imperial River and supported by walk-to-town neighborhoods. The following guidelines apply to planning and development within this overlay area. This area shall be known as the Old U.S. 41 Corridor Redevelopment Area. 
(d)  The images in Exhibit V illustrate acceptable building forms and architectural styles. These images are for informational purposes only and do not dictate actual design. However, they are representative of the intent of these regulations. These regulations encourage architectural style that demonstrates "Old Florida Coastal" vernacular, Mediterranean or the Bermuda/Island style. 
(e)  The walkability of the Old U.S. 41 Corridor Redevelopment Area takes precedent as a design element. As part of the evaluation of walkability, human scale shall be considered. 
(Ord. No. 09-13; Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1152), 1-19-2011; Ord. No. 13-01, § 1(4-1152), 2-6-2013; Ord. No. 13-09, § 1(4-1152), 8-7-2013) 
Sec. 4-868. - Overview of Redevelopment Overlay District regulations and processes. 
(a)  Property owners in the Redevelopment Overlay District are required to develop or redevelop their property in conformance with the applicable redevelopment overlay district regulations and the approved community redevelopment plan. The city manager or designee may review variances administratively within all redevelopment sub-areas, which may include: 
(1)  Site design, including architectural standards described in section 4-869(3). 
(2)  Building regulations (including height, setbacks, building siting, landscaping and regulations specified in Table 4-872 A) up to an additional five percent of the maximum or within five percent of a minimum may be approved through this administrative process, as identified in the specific building regulation. 
(3)  Review criteria. In reviewing an administrative variance, the city manager or designee shall find that the variance accomplishes the purpose and intent of the redevelopment area in a manner that is equal to, or better than, the site design and building regulations for this division. The approval shall specifically note the approved variance and the basis for their approval. 
(b)  The review process explained in this section may be before or concurrent with the zoning process, but is mandated prior to the issuance of the development order. If prior to zoning, recommendations will be given to the zoning reviewer and applicant in the form of conditions to be incorporated in the zoning process. The review process may not take longer than 60 days from the date the matter is placed on the reviewers agenda, unless agreed to by the applicant. 
(c)  Density. 
(1)  The relationship of the Old U.S. 41 Corridor Redevelopment Area Master Plan as depicted in Exhibit 1 to the Bonita Plan Policy 1.1.11 is as follows: 
OLD U.S. 41 CORRIDOR REDEVELOPMENT AREA MASTER PLAN RESIDENTIAL DENSITY RANGE 
Sub-area Land Use Category Maximum Standard Density Maximum Standard Density with Bonus 2A and 2B Single-family residential 5.8 du/acre N/A 4 Multifamily residential 10 du/acre 15 du/acre 5 Townhomes 10 du/acre 14 du/acre 6A and 6B Mixed-Use 15 du/acre residential

(2)  Existing lots that exceed current density may be permitted to replace up to the existing lawful density or intensity prior to a natural disaster in accordance with Bonita Plan Future Land Use Element Objective 1.6. Any application under this process must comply with the design standards set forth in the overlay regulations. 
(3)  Intensity/density conversion factor. Mixed use development within sub-area 6A and 6B may convert allowable commercial floor area ratio to residential dwelling units subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  For the purposes of this section the intensity of 400 square feet of commercial is equal to the density of one residential dwelling unit. 
(b)  A minimum of 60 percent of the overall intensity for any mixed use development within sub-areas 6A and 6B shall be derived from commercial uses. 
(4)  Bonus densities are permitted in accordance with the bonus density provisions set forth in division 12 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 09-13; Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1153), 1-19-2011; Ord. No. 13-01, § 1(4-1153), 2-6-2013; Ord. No. 13-09, § 1(4-1153), 8-7-2013; Ord. No. 15-08 , § 1, 4-15-2015; 15-21 , § 1, 10-21-2015; Ord. No. 16-01 , § 1, 1-20-2016) 
Sec. 4-869. - Regulations and processes for development within the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Urban Core. 
    In addition to the regulations contained in section 4-871, all development within the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Urban Core (as depicted in Exhibit II) shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Design review meeting and submission requirements for the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Urban Core. 
a.  The review process is to help guide the planning and design of projects and buildings within the Urban Core of the Old U.S. 41 Corridor Redevelopment Area as defined in the master plan. The intent of the review is to strive to create a genuine downtown area with well-designed and sensible buildings that work together harmoniously, while the individual buildings themselves are different. The city's objective is to encourage high quality development that will be of benefit to its residents and others for generations to come. The purpose of the review is to encourage a design approach and product that is compatible with southwest Florida's cultural and geographical context. The design process should incorporate the natural and manmade environmental conditions, as well as the social and economic milieu that any development within or near the town center needs to accommodate. The review is to encourage good design and good buildings that fit within the context of the downtown area. 
b.  Consistent with section 3-487(f), a reviewer will offer advice and recommendations concerning the applications for each specific development. 
c.  When any property owner has a project requiring new, rehabilitated or remodeled building within the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Urban Core area, the applicant must submit during the design phases of any project, including hardscape improvement designs proposed on any properties within the area, regardless of whether a building is involved (for example, the proposed layout of a parking lot). 
d.  The owner or authorized representative shall attend the review meeting if this is a major impact project. A review meeting may be needed for a minor impact project, depending on the submitted materials. 
1.  A minor-impact project is one that does not involve structural changes except replacement with identical materials. It can be accommodated by either an informal meeting or by providing the reviewer with simple illustrations, drawings, or diagrams that clearly indicate the intent of the design of the project in its relation to the streetscape. The reviewer can then determine whether a meeting is necessary. Examples of a minor impact project include the addition of a sign, an awning, replacing of windows or doors, or the repainting of a façade, or other such minor improvement to a building. An owner, or tenant, or a representative thereof, such as a sign company, awning company, graphics firm, etc., may make the presentation to the reviewer for the applicant, if needed. 
2.  All other projects not considered minor shall be deemed major impact projects. For any architectural projects determined to have a major impact, the Florida-licensed architect or engineer responsible for the design of the building or the project and its buildings shall make submissions and presentations to the reviewer. For a planning concept project, the Florida planner or planning entity, the Florida-licensed landscape architect or architect responsible for the planning of the project shall make submissions and presentations to the reviewer. For a landscape design project, a Florida-licensed landscape architect shall make submissions and presentations to the reviewer. The professionals involved in the design will be referenced throughout this article as the designer. For the first meeting (or others as required by the process or the reviewer) the designer shall be present at the meeting and make the presentation of the project to the reviewer. A dialogue between the designer and the reviewer shall follow the presentation in a cooperative and constructive manner: designer-to-designer. At the conclusion of the discussions, the reviewer will provide specific and general statements regarding the projects conformance with the regulations and design standards as set forth in subsections (b) (building and site uses) and (c) (architectural standards) of this section. 
e.  Major impact projects: the design review meetings and submissions. 
1.  A major impact project is any project not considered a minor impact project in this section. 
2.  Optional pre-design dialogue: The designer may schedule with the reviewer a pre-design meeting to discuss the process and its intent. 
3.  The applicant designer of any major impact project should deliver designs for a building or project at least two weeks prior to the meeting. Elements to be submitted at the first design meeting: 
(i)  A contextual site plan of the project and surrounding areas within 200 feet of the subject property. (Images taken from Google Earth would be an appropriate base map upon which the project may be inserted and notes regarding contextual features may be added); 
(ii)  Photos of the street façades of both sides of the street on which the project is proposed: 
A.  Site plan and building footprint to scale, including the landscaping concept. Key or critical elements on the site plans and sections need to be dimensioned. Provide drawings at a scale appropriate to the design and sufficient to be legible to the reviewer. A minimum scale is one-sixteenth inch = 1.0 feet for architects and one inch = 30 feet for engineers; 
B.  Site section from back lot line (or across alley), through the site, then across the fronting street to the other side, and including the proposed building or buildings in section, to scale; 
C.  3D graphics of project exterior views, sufficient to explain the project in its context. Provide the drawings in color. (While color and material is important, the emphasis is on form, context, volume, and so on); and 
D.  Other illustrations or exhibits the designer feels are warranted or may be helpful. 
The designer may use whatever medium he wishes to present to the reviewer, but the designer should be aware of the limitations of the venue for the presentation. However, in addition to the materials used for the presentation, please also provide a package of the presentation materials in an 81/2 x 11 bound format for the reviewer's records, to be maintained at community development. 
Note: All materials shall have the designers or designers firms name along with the Florida license number and date. 
E.  Within three working days from the first meeting, the reviewer will provide to the applicant individual written findings and recommendations. 
4.  Development orders and/or building permit stage. Plans submitted to community development for plan review will be examined, and considered in light of the reviewer's findings and recommendations, to determine if the plans are consistent with the design review provisions. 
f.  Minor-impact projects: the design review meetings and submissions. 
1.  For minor impact projects as defined in this section, submissions below are required, and unless additional information is needed by the reviewer or if the designer requests otherwise, no meeting is required. While there is not a set time prior to a scheduled design meeting, the owner or authorized representative of any minor-impact project should deliver designs for a building or project at least two weeks prior to the meeting. If it is determined that the project is to be deemed a major-impact project, the applicant will be notified as soon as possible prior to the meeting. 
2.  Design meeting, if applicable. The design meeting will be held at the earliest point of concept or schematic design that the designer responsible for the design can bring the schematic to the reviewer. (The applicant should contact the city manager or designee at least ten working days in advance of a regularly scheduled meeting.) At the meeting, the projects designer must provide enough information to the reviewer that mutual dialogue will be productive. Others may be in attendance, but the dialogue will be among the designers only, with opportunity for other comment. The objective is that the review process generate ideas and suggestions that will result in an appropriate design for the redevelopment area. 
3.  Elements to be submitted at the design meeting. 
(i)  A contextual site plan of the project and surrounding areas within 200 feet of the subject property. (Images taken from Google Earth would be an appropriate base map upon which the project may be inserted and notes regarding contextual features may be added.) This step may be omitted if the project is a repainting of a building or façade or a proposed sign or other such very simple improvement. 
(ii)  Photos of the street façades of both sides of the street on which the project is proposed. 
(iii)  Elevations (to scale) or, as an alternative, 3D graphics of the improvement, sufficient to explain the design. Provide the drawings, sketches, or diagrams in color. 
(iv)  Any other illustrations or exhibits the designer feels are warranted or may be helpful. The designer may use whatever medium he or she wishes to present to the reviewer, but the designer should be aware of the limitations of the venue for the presentation. However, in addition to the materials used for the presentation, please also provide a package of the presentation materials in an 81/2 x 11 bound format for the records to be maintained at community development. 
(v)  Within three working days from the design meeting, the reviewer will provide to the applicant and the community development its written findings and recommendations. 
(vi)  The findings shall reflect the reviewer's determination whether the development plans are consistent with the regulations and standards set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(vii)  The reviewer's recommendations may include suggestions for more appropriate alternative allowable materials or standards. Where the reviewer determines that a design aspect is appropriate but is otherwise prohibited or discouraged by the provisions of subsections (b) or (c) of this section, the reviewer may include a recommendation to allow an administrative deviation. Such recommendations may involve, but are not limited to, elements such as automatic doors, colors and materials, awnings, the location of outside dining chairs and tables, etc. 
g.  Upon receiving a recommendation and implementing possible revisions, the applicant may continue with community development for review. Plans submitted to the community development will be examined and considered in light of the reviewer's findings and recommendations, to determine if the plans are consistent with the provisions of this section and section 4-870 
(2)  Building and site uses. 
a.  Applicability. Only to areas within the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Urban Core as depicted in Exhibit II. Uses not specifically listed under permitted shall be prohibited, unless the proposed uses has similar traffic, patronage, intensity and characteristics similar to those cited therein. The determination of similarity shall be determined by the director of community development. 
b.  Permitted uses.

Subdivision III. - Felts Avenue Subdistrict 

Sec. 4-886. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The intent of establishing this subdistrict is to create a transition between more intense mixed-use development to the west and the established single-family neighborhood to the east. By permitting commercial uses of low intensity adjacent to mixed-use development, the impacts of those uses could be reduced gradually creating a more integrated feel to the community. Permitted uses and development standards for this area are intended to establish a subdistrict that embraces the city's vision for redevelopment on Old U.S. 41 with consideration for adjacent residential uses. This subdistrict will consist of existing single-family residences while allowing for low intensity nonresidential uses. 
(b)  Applicability. The Felts Avenue Subdistrict shall apply to those areas generally defined as property south of the Imperial River and east of Felts Avenue, extending approximately block east of Felts Avenue, as designated in the Bonita Plan. The provisions of this subdistrict shall supplement or supersede the provisions of the underlying zoning districts. Those provisions of the city Land Development Code and Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Overlay District shall apply except when in conflict with this subdistrict. In the event of a conflict, the provisions of this district shall apply. 
(c)  Permitted uses. Uses not specifically listed under permitted shall be prohibited, unless the proposed uses has similar traffic, patronage, intensity and characteristics similar to those cited therein. The determination of similarity shall be determined by the director of community development.

(2)  Bed and breakfasts, not to exceed 12 bedrooms. 
(3)  Dance, art, and music studios. 
(4)  Dwelling unit (as limited by density in the Bonita Plan and Sub-area designation). 
(5)  Home occupational uses/home offices (use must be conducted within the residence, with clients and employees permitted, based on meeting parking requirements). 
(6)  Public uses. 
(7)  Professional offices. 
(8)  Recreational facilities (public and private). 
(9)  Retail (within existing structures). 
(10)  Restaurant or specialty food establishment (within existing structures). Outdoor seating by special exception only. 
(d)  Dimensional requirements. 
(1)  Residential. All residential development, redevelopment, and alterations to existing structures will be in accordance with section 4-872. 
(2)  Nonresidential. 
a.  All nonresidential development standards will be in accordance with 4-869; however a minimum of 15 feet side setback along property lines is required when adjacent to a single-family residential use. 
b.  Infill development, redevelopment, and substantial improvements. Infill development, redevelopment, and substantial improvements for commercial uses of existing structures within this subdistrict shall maintain the character and scale of single-family homes and shall conform to the design standards for nonresidential and residential uses contained in sections 4-869 through 4-871. Any structures floor to area ratio (FAR) must be compatible with existing properties within the subdistrict so as to achieve compatibility with mass and scale. 
(3)  Regulations and processes for development within the Felts Avenue Subdistrict. For any structural changes associated with a change of use, the regulations contained in sections 4-869 through 4-871 shall apply. 
(4)  Parking. Parking for commercial or multifamily developments must be provided per section 4-1732 or 4-871. Parking may be provided entirely on-street, in a manner not to interfere with vehicular movement. The city manager shall have the authority to reduce required parking administratively. 
(5)  Stormwater.

EXHIBIT V 
The following design guidelines shall apply to the development and redevelopment within the Downtown Redevelopment Overlay Area. These guidelines are not intended to limit creativity, rather they are established to act as a tool for site-specific design of new and redeveloped structures that recognize and meet the intent of the Downtown Redevelopment Overlay Area. The massing, scale, articulation, arrangement of doors and windows, roof style, and overall architectural style all make up the character of a building and contribute to the collective appearance of the downtown and surrounding neighborhood.

(Ord. No. 15-27 , § 2, 12-2-2015) 
Sec. 4-893. - Site design standards. 
(a)  Amenity zones. Developments that abut U.S. 41 must address the public realm through the incorporation of an amenity zone that meets the following minimum criteria. These standards may be administratively waived where principal structures are located within 50 feet of the U.S. 41 right-of-way. 
(1)  Retention ponds smaller than five acres and visible from the U.S. 41 right-of-way must enhance the public realm through two or more of the following: 
a.  Fountain or water feature consistent with all other city ordinances. 
b.  Enhanced littoral plantings with a minimum of two native wetland herbaceous plants per three linear feet of lake shoreline as measured from control elevation and a minimum of one cluster of native wetland tree and shrubs within a 50-square-foot area containing a minimum of 25 plants. The tree and shrub cluster may be used to offset the minimum number of required herbaceous plants in accordance with LDC section 3-420. 
c.  Gazebo, trellis, pergolas or other architectural feature. 
(2)  Pedestrian amenities. Developments must incorporate sidewalks, benches, street furniture, planters, and other pedestrian amenities in their design. All accessories such as railings, trash receptacles, street furniture and bicycle racks must be complimentary to and consistent with the architectural design of principal building(s) within the development. 
(b)  U.S. 41 right-of-way buffer. U.S. 41 right-of-way buffer requirements. Developments that directly abut the U.S. 41 right-of-way must provide the following buffer: 
(1)  The landscape buffer shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width with five trees per 100 lineal feet. Clustering of trees and plant material is encouraged to promote healthy growth of vegetation, screen parking areas from public view, and generally uphold the view corridors along U.S. 41. 
(2)  The required trees and palms shall be clustered in double rows with a minimum of three trees per cluster. Canopy trees shall be planted a minimum of 30 feet on center within a cluster. Palms shall be planted in staggered heights, a minimum of three palms per cluster, spaced at a maximum of eight feet on center, with a minimum of three feet in difference in height between each tree. The maximum spacing between canopy trees and/or palm clusters is 50 feet. 
(3)  All trees must be a minimum of 14 feet in height at the time of installation, and shrubs must be a minimum of three feet in height at time of installation. The buffer must be designed in a manner that does not block signage. 
(4)  The buffer must be designed in a manner that facilitates pedestrian access to the development. Where perimeter fences and walls are incorporated into the perimeter buffer design of the site, the pedestrian access point(s) must be visible and well marked from the adjacent rights-of-way, and must include an archway, pergola, or other architectural feature to identify the pedestrian access. 
(5)  Where buildings are located a maximum of 25 feet from the U.S. 41 right-of-way line, an alternative buffer may be permitted in accordance with LDC section 3-421. 
(6)  For developments defined as large-scale retail establishments within the U.S. 41 Overlay, refer also to the supplementary regulations in section 4-1560.

(b)  Vehicular interconnections required. Developments are required to provide vehicular, interconnections to the adjacent property, regardless of existing or proposed land use, unless one of the following criteria are met: 
(1)  It is not physically possible to provide the interconnection. 
(2)  The cost associated with the shared access or interconnection is unreasonable. For this application unreasonable will be considered when the cost exceeds the cost of a typical local road section or is above ten percent of the value of the improvements being made to the development. 
(3)  The location of environmentally sensitive lands, either on site or off site, precludes it and mitigation is not possible. 
(4)  The abutting use is found to be incompatible with the existing or proposed use. All developments required to provide interconnections to existing and future developments must dedicate sufficient right-of-way or easement for all required roads, sidewalks, and bike lanes. Bike lane and sidewalk interconnections must be constructed concurrently with the required vehicular interconnection. 
(c)  Pedestrian interconnections required. Sidewalks and crosswalks must be provided to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic both internal and external to the site. Pedestrians will only share pavement with vehicular traffic in marked crosswalks.

Sec. 4-895. - Intersection design and corner lots. 
(a)  Corner lots. Sites located at collector or arterial intersections along U.S. 41 shall be designed to define and give prominence to the corner on which they are sited and contribute to the public realm through the use of building placement, both principal and accessory; accessory structures or architectural feature, such as pergolas, bell towers, monuments; landscape feature; or other focal point. 
    Developments subject to this subsection must be designed to include a minimum of one of the following design elements: 
(1)  Principal building placement. Corner lot design requirements may be accomplished through placement of the principal structure a maximum of 25 feet from each adjacent right-of-way. The building design and placement must also provide pedestrian access from the street intersection. The design of the building must also incorporate an architectural feature, or features, including but not limited to: dome, conical or pyramidal roof; storefront or building protrusion, bay, porch element or arcade that wraps around the corner; public entrance that protrudes or is cut-away from the corner; change in roofline; such as a gabled end to mark the corner. 
Where developments employ this design concept the director may administratively waive or modify right-of-way buffer requirements, building perimeter plantings, and minimum open space requirements. 
Figure 1. Corner Lot Principal Building Placement (N.T.S) 

(2)  Accessory structure placement. Where buildings are set back more than 25 feet from the adjacent rights-of-way, the corner lot design requirements may be accomplished through the placement of an accessory structure(s) or architectural feature along the property frontage, including, but not limited to: pergolas, belltower, colonnades, gazebos, or other structure. The feature must be set back a maximum of 25 feet from the right-of-way and must be a minimum of eight feet in height and maximum of 20 feet in height to address the pedestrian realm. The accessory structure must be designed in a manner that is complimentary to and consistent with the architectural design of principal building(s) within the development.

(1)  Intent; applicability. 
a.  It is the intent of this subsection to require nonprofit and for-profit organizations and establishments to obtain a one-day temporary alcoholic beverage permit for the sale of alcoholic beverages at the specific location where an event is held. This subsection pertains to, but is not necessarily limited to, the following uses: 
1.  Grand openings or open houses at residential, commercial or industrial developments; 
2.  Special outdoor holiday or celebration events at bars and restaurants;

5.  Block parties; and 
6.  Carnivals. 
b.  Only 12 temporary alcoholic beverage permits may be issued per year to a specific location. If more than 12 permits are sought per year for a specific location, then the location must obtain a permanent alcoholic beverage special exception. If the event for which the temporary alcoholic beverage permit is sought continues for longer than one day, the applicant may petition the director for an extended permit. A temporary alcoholic beverage permit may not be issued for more than three days. 
(2)  Procedure for approval.

1.  The name and address of the applicant; 
2.  A general description of the exact site where alcoholic beverages are to be sold and consumed;

(e)  Expiration of approval. After the following time periods, the administrative or special exception approval of a location for the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises granted in accordance with this section will expire and become null and void: 
(1)  In the case of an existing structure, the approval will expire six months from the date of approval, unless, within that period of time, operation of the alcoholic beverage establishment has commenced. For purposes of this subsection, the term "operation" is defined as the sale of alcoholic beverages in the normal course of business. 
(2)  In the case of a new structure, the approval will expire one year from the date of approval unless, within that period of time, operation of the alcoholic beverage establishment has commenced. The director may grant one extension of up to six months, if construction is substantially complete. 
(f)  Transfer of permit. Alcoholic beverage permits, excluding permits for bottle clubs and as noted in section 4-1023(a)(1)i, issued by virtue of this section is a privilege running with the land. Sale of the real property will automatically vest the purchaser with all rights and obligations originally granted to or imposed on the applicant. The privilege may not be separated from the fee simple interest in the realty. 
(g)  Expansion of area designated for permit. The area designated for an alcoholic beverage permit may not be expanded without filing a new application for an alcoholic beverage permit in accordance with the requirements contained in this chapter. The new application must cover both the existing designated area as well as the proposed expanded area. All areas approved must be under the same alcoholic beverage permit and subject to uniform rules and regulations. 
(h)  Nonconforming establishments. 
(1)  Expansion. A legally existing establishment engaged in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages made nonconforming by reason of the regulations contained in this section may not be expanded without a special exception. The term "expansion," as used in this subsection, includes the enlargement of space for the use and uses incidental thereto, the expansion of a beer and wine bar to include intoxicating liquor, as that term is defined by the Florida Statutes, and the expansion of a bar use to a nightclub use. Nothing in this subsection may be construed as an attempt to modify any prohibition or diminish any requirement of state law. 
(2)  Abandonment. Any uses, created and established in a legal manner, which thereafter become nonconforming, may continue until there is an abandonment of the permitted location for a continuous six-month period. For purposes of this subsection, the term "abandonment" means failure to use the location for consumption on the premises purposes as authorized by the special exception, administrative approval, or other approval. Once a nonconforming use is abandoned, it cannot be reestablished, unless it conforms to the requirements of this chapter, and new permits are issued. 
(i)  Revocation of permit or approval. 
(1)  City council has the authority to revoke an alcoholic beverage special exception, administrative approval, or other approval upon any of the following grounds: 
a.  A determination that an application for special exception or administrative approval contains knowingly false or misleading information. 
b.  Violation by the permit holder of any provision of this chapter, or violation of any state statute which results in the revocation of the permit holder's state alcoholic beverage license by the state alcoholic beverage license board or any successor regulatory authority. 
c.  Repeated violation of any city ordinance at the location within the 12-month period preceding the revocation hearing. 
d.  Failure to renew a state liquor license, or written declaration of abandonment by the tenant and owner of the premises if under lease, or by the owner himself if not under lease. 
e.  Abandonment of the premises. An establishment which continually maintains (renews) its state liquor license, even though it has suspended active business with the public, will not be deemed to have been abandoned for purposes of this subsection. 
f.  Violation by the permit holder of any condition imposed upon the issuance of the special exception or administrative approval. 
g.  Violation of any of the minimum standards of the special exception. 
(2)  Prior to revoking an administrative approval, special exception, or other approval for alcoholic beverages, the city council must conduct a public hearing at which the permit holder may appear and present evidence and testimony concerning the proposed revocation. At the hearing, the city council may revoke the permit if a violation described in this subsection is established by a preponderance of the evidence. The permit holder must be notified of the grounds upon which revocation is sought prior to any hearing, and must be given notice of the time and place of the hearing in the same manner as set forth in article II of this chapter. 
(3)  When an alcoholic beverage permit is revoked in accordance with the terms of this subsection, the city may not consider a petition requesting an alcoholic beverage permit on the property for a period of 12 months from the date of final action on the revocation. 
(4)  Upon written demand of the city council, any owner or operator of an establishment with a COP license must make, under oath, a statement itemizing the percentage of his gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic beverages. Failure to comply with the demand within 60 days of the demand date is grounds for revocation of the special exception, administrative approval, or other approval. 
(j)  Appeals. All appeals of decisions by the director must be in accordance with the procedures set forth in article II or article III of this chapter for appeals of administrative decisions. 
(k)  Bottle clubs. 
(1)  All bottle clubs operating under a valid special permit are deemed nonconforming on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(2)  All nonconforming bottle clubs must discontinue their use no later than 12 months from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(3)  No new bottle clubs will be allowed in any zoning district. This subsection supersedes and repeals any existing city regulations in conflict herewith.

Stored feed must be secured in metal containers to prevent mice and other pests. 
(9)  No slaughtering of the hens is allowed on the subject site.

All antenna-supporting structures 150 feet or greater in height aboveground level must be artificially lighted and maintained pursuant to the technical requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration's current Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, Obstruction Marking and Lighting, as amended, or other appropriate aviation authority, unless pre-empted by FAA or FCC regulations. All lighting must be approved in conjunction with the development order for the facility. 
2.  If the height of a structure under construction equals or exceeds the height at which permanent obstruction lights are required by the FAA, FCC or the division of development services, temporary high or medium intensity flashing lights must be installed at that level in accordance with Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, Obstruction Marking and Lighting, as amended. 
(4)  Notice of commencement of construction. Forty-eight hours before commencing construction of an antenna-supporting structure, and within 48 hours after the antenna-supporting structure construction reaches its maximum height, the county port authority, sheriff's office, emergency medical services, the local fire district and the county mosquito control district must be notified by the entity constructing the antenna-supporting structure. Notice must include the location of the antenna-supporting structure tied to the state plane coordinate system for the Florida West Zone (North American Datum of 1983/1990 Adjustment). 
(5)  Floor area. Floor area will be calculated based on the total impervious surface associated with an equipment enclosure. Floor area may not exceed 400 square feet per antenna array, not to exceed 2,500 square feet total area, without approval by special exception provided that the floor area meets all applicable setbacks and lot coverage requirements. 
(f)  Signage. 
(1)  Signs on antenna-supporting structures, ancillary appurtenances, equipment enclosures, or on any fence or wall are prohibited, unless permitted in accordance with this subsection. 
(2)  If high voltage is necessary for the operation of proposed wireless communications facilities, "High Voltage-Danger" and "No Trespass" warning signs not greater than one square foot in area must be permanently attached to the fence or wall at intervals of not less than 40 feet and upon the access gate, or as otherwise required by the FAA or FCC. 
(3)  A sign not greater than one square foot in area must be attached to the access gate that includes the following information: 
a.  Federal registration number, if applicable; 
b.  Name of property owner, facility owner, providers, and contact person; and 
c.  An emergency contact number for the contact person. 
(Ord. No. 03-15; Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1447), 1-19-2011; Ord. No. 15-07 , § 1, 3-18-2015) 
Sec. 4-1222. - Fees and insurance. 
(a)  Antenna-supporting structures and wireless communications facilities must be insured by the owners against damage to persons and against damage to property. The owners must provide a certificate of insurance to the director annually. 
(b)  Fees for antenna-supporting structures and wireless communications facilities permitting and renewal, monitoring of emissions and inspection of structures, and other fees will be established by city council by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 03-15; Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1450), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-1223. - Discontinued use. 
(a)  Notice of discontinued use. The owner of an antenna-supporting structure 75 feet or greater in height, the use of which has been discontinued for a period of one year, on an annual basis must provide the director with an affidavit of an intention to continue the use, including a description of the owners efforts to keep the facility in use. If the affidavit is not provided the director may make a preliminary determination of discontinued use. For any other antenna-supporting structure, the use of which is discontinued for a period of 180 days, the director may make a preliminary determination of discontinued use. In making such a determination, the director may request documentation and affidavits from the property owners regarding the structure's usage, including evidence that use of the structure is imminent. The failure of a property owners to provide updated contact information on the owner of the antenna-supporting structure for two consecutive years will be presumptive evidence of discontinued use. If the director determines that the use of an antenna-supporting structure or antenna has been discontinued, the director will provide the property owner with a written notice of discontinued use by certified mail. 
(b)  Declaration of discontinued use. If the property owner fails to respond to the notice of discontinued use or to adequately demonstrate that the use of the antenna or antenna-supporting structure is not discontinued within 90 days, such failure will be evidence of discontinued use. Based on the foregoing, or on any other relevant evidence before the director, the director may make a final determination of discontinued use, whereupon a declaration of discontinued use will be issued to the property owner by certified mail. 
(c)  Removal of facility. 
(1)  Within 120 days of a declaration of discontinued use, the property owner must either: 
a.  Reactivate the use of the antennas or antenna-supporting structure as a wireless communications facility or transfer ownership of the antennas or antenna-supporting structure to another owner who will make use of the facility; or 
b.  Dismantle and remove the facility. 
(2)  If transfer of ownership occurs, the new owner must supply the director with an affidavit attesting that the antennas or antenna-supporting structure will be in use within 120 days of the transfer in accordance with subsection (c)(1) of this section. If the facility remains discontinued upon the expiration of 120 days, the city may enter upon the property and remove the facility, with all costs to be borne by the property owner. The city may use the funds posted in the surety for this purpose. 
(Ord. No. 03-15; Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1451), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-1224. - Nonconforming antenna-supporting structures. 
(a)  The addition or replacement of antennas and any ancillary appurtenances on or around any type of nonconforming structure will not be treated as an increase in the nonconformity of the structure. 
(b)  Antenna-supporting structures made nonconforming as to height by implementation of this division that have not received a variance, as indicated in subsection (f) of this section , will be reviewed by city council no sooner than 30 years from the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived to evaluate whether the use of the portion of the antenna-supporting structure in excess of the height limitations to support active wireless communication antennas has been discontinued, as described in section 4-1223, and the portion is creating significant visual impacts. The owner of the antenna-supporting structure and each known occupant of the nonconforming structure will receive written notice from the city of the undertaking of this review and shall be allowed to provide information to be used in the review. 
(c)  If the use of the portion of the antenna-supporting structure in excess of the height limitations to support active wireless communication antennas has been discontinued and the portion is creating significant visual impacts, the city council may, at its discretion, require that the nonconforming portion be removed or otherwise made to conform. 
(d)  If the portions of the antenna-supporting structure in excess of the height limitations is in use supporting active wireless communication antennas and is creating significant visual impacts, city council will evaluate whether those antennas can reasonably be lowered to a conforming height and the height nonconforming portion be removed, or if the antennas can be reasonably replaced with flush-mounted antennas to reduce the visual impacts; provided that any such modification does not significantly: 
(1)  Decrease the network service provided; or 
(2)  Create the need for additional wireless communication facilities elsewhere. 
(e)  If the portion of the antenna-supporting structure in excess of the height limitations is not creating significant visual impacts, no modification of the structure will be required. 
(f)  No sooner than 25 years from the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived, the antenna-supporting structure owner, with consent from the underlying property owner, may apply for a special exception in accordance with section 4-1225, to exempt the antenna-supporting structure from the review. 
(Ord. No. 03-15; Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1452), 1-19-2011; Ord. No. 15-07, § 1, 3-18-2015) 
Sec. 4-1225. - Special exception criteria; broadcast antenna supporting structure. 
    In order to grant a special exception for a wireless communication facility, the city council must make at least one of the following findings of fact: 
(1)  Failure to grant the special exception would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services; 
(2)  The special exception is necessary to ensure adequate public safety and emergency management communications; 
(3)  The special exception or any required variance or deviation is the minimum necessary in order for the applicant to provide broadcast services pursuant to an FCC-issued license or construction permit (existence of an FCC license requiring a broadcast antenna at a given height will constitute a presumption that this requirement has been met); 
(4)  Failure to grant the special exception would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of amateur radio services; or the special exception will obviate the need for additional antenna-supporting structures in the geographic search area.

Secs. 4-1254-4-1279. - Reserved. 
Subdivision II. - Residential Development 

Sec. 4-1280. - Applicability of subdivision. 
    The provisions set forth in this subdivision apply to any proposed or existing residential development. For purposes of this subdivision, the term "residential" does not include hotel/motel density calculations (see division 19 of this article). 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1491), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-1281. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subdivision, have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Gross residential acres means the total land area of a residential development as follows: 
(1)  Land areas to be included are as follows: 
a.  The area of existing and proposed artificial water bodies within the parcel boundaries; 
b.  Parks, noncommercial recreational facilities and open space; 
c.  Schools (noncommercial); 
d.  Police, fire and emergency services; 
e.  Sewage, water and drainage facilities; 
f.  Land proposed to be used for street rights-of-way or street easements; 
g.  Land proposed to be used for utility rights-of-way or easements; and 
h.  Land used for residential buildings and normal residential accessory uses. 
(2)  Existing open natural bodies of water may not be included in calculating gross residential acres. 
(3)  In mixed use developments, any existing or proposed street right-of-way or street easement, and any utility right-of-way or easement, must be prorated between the residential and the nonresidential uses. 
    Gross residential density means the ratio of housing units per gross residential acre. 
    Total land area means the total area of land, expressed in acres or fractions thereof, contained within the boundary lines of a development. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1492), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-1282. - Calculation of total permissible housing units. 
(a)  Procedure for determining density. The Bonita Plan establishes a standard and maximum residential density range permissible for each residential land use category. The procedure set forth in this section must be used to determine the standard residential density as well as the total number of housing units which may be permitted within a development. 
(b)  Proposed developments. 
(1)  Determination of land area. The applicant must provide the calculations used in determining the following: 
1.  Total land area of the proposed development. 
2.  Total gross residential acres. 
3.  Gross residential acres less any area classified as wetlands. 
4.  Acres of any area classified as freshwater wetlands. 
5.  Acres of any other areas classified as wetlands (if applicable for density calculations). 
(2)  Estimation of total permissible housing units. The number of permissible housing units is addressed in the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Existing developments and lots. Due to the problems of computing gross density in the same manner as set forth for new developments, the following procedures must be followed: 
(1)  Single-family structures. Any lawfully existing lot of record zoned for residential use will be permitted one single-family residence so long as the lot complies with either the property development regulations for the zoning district in which located, or the owner receives a favorable single-family residence determination in accordance with section 4-2399. 
(2)  Two-family or duplex structures. If two or more abutting properties have each qualified for the right to construct a single-family residence, and if the lots or parcels are located in a zoning district which permits duplex or two-family dwellings, the property owner may combine the lots to build a single duplex or two-family building in lieu of constructing two single-family residences. 
(3)  Townhouse or multiple-family structures. Any legally existing lot of record which is zoned for townhouse or multiple-family development will be permitted dwelling units as follows: 
a.  Developments which are not planned developments or PUDs. When reviewing a request for a building permit for a townhouse or multiple-family building which is not part of a PUD or planned development, the maximum permitted dwelling units will be determined by the property development regulations set forth for the zoning district in which located for the particular type of building proposed; provided that: 
1.  The maximum number of dwelling units permitted will not exceed the density for the land use category in which located; and 
2.  The parcel area must be calculated as the area of the lot in question plus one-half of any abutting right-of-way or easement. 
b.  Planned developments and PUDs. Maximum density will be as set forth in the approving zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 11-02, § 3(4-1493), 1-19-2011) 
Sec. 4-1283. - Density equivalents. 
(a)  Applicability. The density equivalents set forth in this subsection will be used in situations where it is necessary to convert permissible uses to residential dwelling unit equivalents. When permitted by the use regulations in a zoning district that permits dwelling units, the permissible density equivalents may not exceed the density limitations set forth in the zoning district or land use category (whichever is less) in which the property is located. 
(b)  Equivalency factors. 
(1)  Where health care, social service, adult living facilities (ALF), continuing care facilities (CCF), or other group quarters (df) are provided in dwelling units, wherein each unit has its own cooking facilities, density equivalents will be calculated on a 1:1 ratio. 
(2)  Except as may be specifically set forth elsewhere in this chapter, where health care, social service, adult living facilities (ALF), continuing care facilities (CCF), or other group quarters (df) are provided in dwelling units or other facilities wherein each unit does not have individual cooking facilities and where meals are served at a central dining facility or are brought to the occupants from a central kitchen, density equivalents will be calculated at the ratio of four people equals one dwelling unit. A planned development, for which the master concept plan states the number of persons that may occupy an approved adult living facility (ALF) or continuing care facility (CCF), may request an amendment to the approved master concept plan to reflect the increased number of occupants based upon the equivalency factor set forth in this section (if applicable). Such amendment will be considered a minor administrative amendment that will be deemed to not increase density and may be approved pursuant to section 4-302(b) as long as existing floor space is not increased to accommodate the increased number of occupants. If increased floor space is required, then a public hearing will be required. 
(3)  Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) of this section, no density equivalency calculation is required for a bed and breakfast (df) in an owner-occupied conventional single-family residence (df) accommodating four or less lodgers. If the bed and breakfast will accommodate more than four lodgers, then the equivalency will be calculated as four lodgers equals one dwelling unit. 
(4)  Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) of this section, no density calculation is required for hospital, prison, jail, boot camp, detention center, or other similar type facility owned or operated by a county, state or federal agency. 
(c)  Determination of permitted density. The maximum permitted density shall be determined by multiplying the number of dwelling units permitted (see subsection (a) of this section) by the appropriate equivalency factor.

However, the need must be documented by a letter from a medical doctor or the state department of health and rehabilitative services or an equivalent federal or state agency. In these cases, the caretaker's income will be counted toward the income tests for eligible households only if the caretaker's income is available to meet the needs of the eligible persons. 
    Fund means the Affordable Housing Trust Fund established by section 4-1319(a). 
    Low income means a person or household whose annual (gross) income does not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, as determined by HUD.

(a)  The city manager or designee will be responsible for maintaining public records of: 
(1)  All dwelling units constructed pursuant to the bonus density program; 
(2)  All such dwelling units that are occupied by eligible households, where applicable; 
(3)  Complaints of violations of the bonus density program that are alleged to have occurred and the disposition of all those complaints; 
(4)  A list of all eligible households who have participated in the bonus density program, where applicable; 
(5)  All such improvements, both on and off site, which are constructed pursuant to the bonus density program; and 
(6)  Such other records as the city manager or designee believes may be necessary or desirable to monitor the success of the program and the degree of compliance therewith. 
(b)  The developer or the subsequent owner of dwelling units obtained via the density bonus program using the affordable housing site-specific density bonus (option 1) set forth in section 4-1317 must submit the following eligible household income verification reports to the planning director so that they may monitor the program for compliance. 
(1)  Verification of the incomes of the households occupying units must be: 
a.  On a form provided by the city; 
b.  Notarized; and 
c.  Submitted annually for ten years from the date that the certificate of occupancy is issued for the unit in question.

(Ord. No. 16-01 , § 1, 1-20-2016) 
Sec. 4-1315. - Eligibility for program. 
(a)  A developer may be eligible to exceed the standard density range for a particular land use category if: 
(1)  The additional dwelling units that are achieved through the bonus density program are available only to eligible households in a site specific manner as described in section 4-1317; or 
(2)  The developer makes a cash contribution to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund as described in section 4-1318; or 
(3)  The additional dwelling units that are achieved through the provision of site design features and/or developer contributions in accordance with the bonus density program for the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Overlay District (option 3). 
(b)  The maximum bonus density a given area of land may be eligible for is set forth in the Bonita Plan. 
(c)  All requests for participation in the program must comply with and be consistent with the Bonita Plan and all other applicable federal, state and regional laws and regulations and must be designed so that: 
(1)  The resulting development does not have substantially increased intensities of land uses along its perimeter, unless adjacent to existing or approved development of a similar intensity, or where such densities are permitted in accordance with the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Overlay District; 
(2)  Existing and committed public facilities are not so overwhelmed that a density increase would be contrary to the overall public interest; 
(3)  There will be no decrease in required open space, buffering, landscaping and preservation areas or cause adverse impacts on surrounding land uses; and 
(4)  Storm shelters or other appropriate mitigation is provided if the development is located within the Category 1 Storm Surge Zone for a land-falling storm as defined by the October 1991 Hurricane Storm Tide Atlas for Lee County prepared by the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council. 
(5)  All dwelling units constructed as a bonus density are mandated green, as outlined in the green building program ordinance. 
(d)  Parcels of land of one-half acre or less. Where the total actual bonus density will consist of only one dwelling unit and the developer agrees to participate in the program, a copy of the agreement required by section 4-1317(b)(1) and the bond required by section 4-1317(b)(2) may be waived upon written request by the community development director prior to approval of the bonus density. 
(e)  Assisted living facilities whose annual rental rates, including all services, do not exceed the levels established for eligible households will be eligible for bonus density consistent with the applicable land use category. Where the cash contribution density bonus option is used, the cash contribution must be applied for each dwelling unit or its equivalent unit built above the standard density. 
(Ord. No. 16-01 , § 1, 1-20-2016) 
Sec. 4-1316. - Approval of density increases. 
(a)  Administrative approval of density increases in conventional zoning districts. The department city manager or designee may administratively approve the use of housing bonus density to increase the density of a proposed development in a conventional zoning district, including the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Overlay District zoning classifications set forth in section 4-866, exhibit I; provided: 
(1)  The request does not exceed the maximum total density allowed by the Bonita Plan for the applicable land use category; and 
(2)  The city manager's or designee's written findings conclude that the proposed development: 
a.  Is in compliance with the Bonita Plan; 
b.  Is zoned for the type of dwelling units to be constructed; 
c.  Is designed so that the resulting development does not have substantially increased intensities of land uses along its perimeter, unless adjacent to existing or approved development of a similar intensity, or where such densities are permitted in accordance with the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Overlay District; 
d.  Is in a location outside of the Category 1 Storm Surge Zone for a land-falling storm as defined by the October 1991 Hurricane Storm Tide Atlas for Lee County prepared by the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council (except within the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Area, as permitted in the Bonita Plan, and as approved by city council) or that the developer has provided sufficient storm shelter or other appropriate mitigation; 
e.  Is in a location where existing and committed public facilities are not so overwhelmed that a density increase would be contrary to the overall public interest; and 
f.  Will not decrease any required open space, buffering, landscaping and preservation areas or cause adverse impacts on surrounding land uses. 
(3)  The city manager or designee's written approval may contain reasonable conditions to mitigate any adverse impacts that could otherwise be created by the density increase. The city manager's or designee's decision may be appealed according to the provisions for appeals of administrative decisions. 
(b)  Planned development zoning districts. An application for a planned development rezoning district may request bonus density concurrently with the rezoning application where the master concept plan clearly shows the location of the additional density and the conditions for approval set forth appropriate commitments to ensure compliance with this division. An existing planned development's approved density may be increased using the bonus density program by amending the planned development approval pursuant to section 4-302. The applicant must submit, as part of the submittal documents, a revised master concept plan that clearly shows the location of the proposed additional density, and must also provide additional information as is needed to describe the changes in impact that the increased density will have over that which was contained in the application for the original approval. 
(c)  Rezoning. If a property owner or developer applying for rezoning intends to use the bonus density program to increase densities above the Bonita Plan standard density range, the application for the rezoning, and the contract required by sections 4-1317(b)(1) and 4-1318(c), where applicable for options 1 and 2, may be submitted at the same time for concurrent review. The maximum density may not exceed the maximum total density for the land use category in which the property is located. The application process, including the use of bonus density, will follow the same procedures applicable to any other rezoning case. 
(d)  If the use of bonus density has been approved, a developer may choose one of the two options set forth in sections 4-1317 and 4-1318 for the provision of affordable housing site-specific density bonus (option 1) or cash contribution density bonus (option 2). Where projects are located within the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Overlay District, the developer may also choose option 3 as set forth in section 4-1320 for the provision of eligible improvements. 
(Ord. No. 16-01 , § 1, 1-20-2016) 
Sec. 4-1317. - Affordable housing site-specific density bonus (option 1). 
(a)  A developer may apply for bonus density if he agrees to build and make the bonus density units available for eligible households. 
(b)  Prior to receiving a final development order or building permit, the developer must: 
(1)  Execute a contract with the city council, in a form approved by the city attorneys office that will bind the developer and his successor: 
a.  In the case of rental units, to rent the unit exclusively to eligible households for a period of ten years or more from the date when the certificate of occupancy for the unit is received. If the dwelling unit is rented initially to an eligible household whose income increases above the levels established for eligible households, the developer must designate another unit for eligible household use in order to maintain the required level of eligible household units; 
b.  In the case of owner-occupied units, to sell the unit to an eligible household, by conveyance that must include a recorded deed restriction prohibiting the transfer, either through rental or sale of the unit, for a period of ten years, to any other person except another eligible household who has never owned a bonus density rental unit or owner-occupied unit; 
c.  To adhere to the limitation on monthly payments set forth in subsection (e) of this section; 
d.  To acknowledge and waive objections to the remedies reserved to the city in subsection (d) of this section; 
e.  To agree to rent or sell only to eligible households as defined in section 4-1311; and 
f.  To agree to comply with all federal, state and local fair housing laws, rules, regulations or orders applicable to the development. 
(2)  Deliver a bond or equivalent performance guarantee acceptable to the city attorney, in an amount equal to 110 percent of the contribution required by section 4-1318 (option 2). The bond or equivalent performance guarantee must guarantee the developer's performance under this option, notwithstanding any subsequent events, including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, change of ownership or death. Such bond or equivalent performance guarantee must provide that the surety will pay to the city an amount equal to 110 percent of the contribution rate set forth in section 4-1318(b)(2) for each bonus density rental unit or owner-occupied unit rented or sold by the principal of the bond in violation of the requirements of subsection (b)(1)a or b or subsection (e) or (f) of this section, plus costs of litigation, including attorney's fees and interest incurred by the city, directly or indirectly, to enforce the requirements of this subdivision. 
(c)  The city council may waive any requirement of this section if the developer is a Florida not-for-profit corporation exempt from federal income taxation as a charitable organization under the provisions of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or of any corresponding section of a subsequently enacted federal revenue act, or if the development is a nonprofit housing project financed, in whole or part, by a mortgage made by or through any agency of the government of the United States of America that is subject to tenant income limitations established by that agency as a condition of the mortgage. 
(d)  In addition to any action necessary to enforce payment of the secured amounts described in subsection (b)(2) of this section, the city may bring an action for legal and equitable relief be necessary to invalidate attempted transfers of legal or equitable real property ownership or possessory rights that would violate the restrictions of subsection (b)(1)a or b of this section. 
(e)  The rental rate of bonus density rental units and the selling price of bonus density owner-occupied units may be determined by the developer; provided, however, that the monthly rent (exclusive of utility charges) or mortgage payments may not exceed 35 percent of the gross monthly income of the lessees or buyers. In the case of assisted living facilities, the rental payment, including all services, may not exceed 80 percent of the household's income. 
(f)  Lessors and sellers may rent or sell bonus density rental units and owner-occupied units only to eligible households. 
(Ord. No. 16-01 , § 1, 1-20-2016) 
Sec. 4-1318. - Cash-contribution density bonus (option 2). 
(a)  A developer may elect to pay the cash contribution set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section and satisfy the other requirements of this section. The degree to which density may be increased pursuant to this option above the standard density limitations otherwise imposed by law represents a bonus to the developer of the land and is offered as a means of encouraging the developer to contribute to the city's Affordable Housing Trust Fund, thereby assisting the city in its efforts to provide adequate housing for eligible households. 
(b)  The bonus density for which a given area of land may qualify depends upon the amount the developer of the land contributes to the city's Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
(1)  Contributions will be based on the number of dwelling units by which the developer desires to exceed the standard density range. 
(2)  The contribution per-unit rate will be established by the administrative code, based on the current fair market value of the land by evidence of a bona fide sales contract or a current property appraisal prepared by a qualified professional that appraises the entire development of a planned development as to the value per unit increased. Once the current fair market value of the land is ascertained, the contribution per-unit rate will be specified in the schedule contained in the administrative code, as may be amended from time to time. 
(3)  For every unit for which a contribution is paid, the developer will be entitled to exceed, by an equal number of units applied to the development as a whole, the standard density cap which otherwise may be imposed on the development in question. However, the development will not be permitted to exceed the applicable maximum bonus density set forth in section 4-1316(b). 
(4)  Final zoning approval, final development order, or building permit if a development order is not required, whichever occurs at the earliest date, will not be issued until the required contribution is paid in full. Except when the density requested in a zoning case is denied, contributions will not be refunded once made, even if the development in question fails to occur for any reason. Density bonuses for which contributions are made will run with the specific development plan submitted and approved by the city concurrent with the request for bonus density units. 
(c)  The developer must execute a contract with the city council, in a form approved by the city attorney's office that binds the developer to the standard contribution per-unit rate and conditions set forth in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. 
(d)  Development made in excess of the standard density which otherwise would be imposed by law but for the provisions of this subdivision must comply with all other legal requirements which may be imposed by current or future federal, state, regional or local laws and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 16-01 , § 1, 1-20-2016) 
Sec. 4-1319. - Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
(a)  All contributions received from developers pursuant to this subdivision will be placed in a fund entitled the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
(b)  The fund will be used to assist the city in its efforts to provide needed housing for eligible households. The assistance may include rental assistance, mortgage assistance for eligible households to become potential homeowners, housing rehabilitation, demolition of dilapidated housing, and relocation of residents to safe, sanitary and decent housing, and other purposes the city council may approve by resolution. The major purpose, however, will be to obtain home ownership for eligible households. In any given fiscal year, at least 75 percent of the fund must be used to assist eligible households. 
(Ord. No. 16-01 , § 1, 1-20-2016) 
Sec. 4-1320. - Regulations and processes for bonus densities within the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Overlay District (option 3).

The contribution per unit rate is based on the current fair market value of the land by evidence of a bona fide sales contract or a current property appraisal prepared by a qualified professional that appraises the entire development of a planned development as to the value per unit increased. Once the current fair market value of the land is ascertained, the contribution per-unit rate will be specified in the schedule contained in the administrative code, as may be amended from time to time. 
(e)  The value of the eligible improvements must be based upon a signed and sealed/certified opinion of probable cost prepared by a professional engineer, architect, landscape architect, or other registered professional. The land costs directly related to the area of the improvement(s) may be included in the total value of proposed improvements. 
(f)  The following are eligible improvements for projects seeking bonus density in the Old U.S. 41 Redevelopment Overlay District subject to the review and approval by the city manager or designee on a project-specific basis: 
(1)  Civic space, to be maintained by the developer or their assign, including landscape and hardscape features. 
(2)  Public art contribution or construction of public art feature on site or on adjacent public lands. The proposal and location must be reviewed and approved by the Art in Public Places Advisory Board. 
(3)  Public access to the Imperial River and its tributaries, which, at a minimum, must include a dock feature and public seating/benches.

(1)  Minimum land area. All uses permitted under this subdivision must have a minimum lot size of five acres. 
(2)  Setbacks for excavation site. 
a.  No excavation may be allowed within: 
1.  One hundred fifty feet of an existing street right-of-way line or easement; 
2.  One hundred feet of any private property line under separate ownership. 
In all cases, the most restrictive setback will apply. 
b.  The city council may allow lesser setbacks in a planned development approval; provided: 
1.  The reclamation plan indicates how access will be made to future development; 
2.  The reclamation plan indicates that the setback area will not be developed after restoration; or 
3.  A closer setback will not be injurious to other property owners and the applicant agrees to fence the excavation site nearest private property under separate ownership if deemed necessary by the city council. 
(3)  Setbacks for accessory buildings or structures. All setbacks for accessory buildings or structures must be shown on the site plan required as part of the application for a general excavation permit and an excavation/mining operation permit. No crusher, mixing plant, bin, tank or structure directly involved in the production process may be located less than 600 feet from any residentially zoned area or district, or 250 feet from all other nonresidential areas or zoning districts. To allow flexibility, the general area of any accessory buildings, structures and processing facilities must be shown on the site plan with the appropriate setbacks as noted in this subsection, listed as criteria for the final placement of these buildings, structures or facilities. 
(4)  Security. All entrances to excavation and removal areas must be restricted from public access during working hours and locked at all other times. 
(5)  Observation wells. 
a.  Where dewatering is proposed and permitted by the city council, shallow observation wells must be installed at regular intervals along the periphery of the proposed site, as prescribed by the division of natural resources. 
b.  The division of natural resources will monitor observation wells monthly to determine the effect on the water table in adjacent areas. The applicant must pay a fee, the amount of which is on file in the city clerk's office, to cover costs of the monitoring. In lieu of monitoring by the division of natural resources, monitoring may be performed by private consultants retained by the operator, provided the results are forwarded to the division. The division may also perform its own monitoring at random. 
(6)  Maximum depth. City council will establish maximum excavation depths after reviewing any findings and recommendations of the South Florida Water Management District and the division of environmental services. The permitted controlled water depth may not exceed the depth permitted by the South Florida Water Management District and may not penetrate through any impervious soil or other confining layer which presently prohibits intermingling of two or more aquifers. 
(7)  Bank slope. 
a.  After excavation is complete and upon reclamation of the site, the banks of the excavations must be sloped at a ratio not greater than six horizontal to one vertical from the top of the finished grade to a water depth of four feet below the dry season depth. The excavation banks must also have a revegetated linear edge of at least 150 feet along the perimeter when abutting a residentially zoned area or district; or 
b.  The bank may be sloped a minimum of four horizontal to one vertical to four feet below the dry season water table if planted with suitable native wetland vegetation according to a plan approved by the city council. Requests for four to one slopes must be included in the schedule of deviations (see section 4-326).

Sec. 4-1466. - Residential project walls. 
(a)  For purposes of this section, a residential project fence means a wall or fence erected around a residential subdivision (but not individual lots) or development of ten or more dwelling units. 
(b)  A residential project fence or wall: 
(1)  May be a maximum height of eight feet around the perimeter of the project upon a finding by development services that the fence does not interfere with vehicle visibility requirements (see section 4-2251) at traffic access points. 
(2)  May include architectural features such as columns, cupolas, fountains, parapets, etc., at a height not to exceed half the fence or wall height (up to four additional feet); provided they are compatible with the project and abutting properties. 
(3)  Required or optional residential project walls must be landscaped on the exterior side (between the wall and the abutting property or street right-of-way) with a minimum of five trees per 100 lineal feet and shrub hedges, within a minimum plantable width of 71/2 feet located on the exterior side of the wall or fence. 
a.  Hedges must be planted and maintained so as to form a 36-inch-high continuous visual screen within one year after time of planting. 
b.  Trees adjacent to a right-of-way must be appropriately sized in mature form so that conflicts with overhead utilities, lighting and signs are avoided. The clustering of trees and use of palms adjacent to the right-of-way will add design flexibility and reduce conflicts. 
(4)  Must be constructed to ensure that historic water flow patterns are accommodated and all stormwater from the site is directed to on-site detention/retention areas in accordance with the SFWMD (South Florida Water Management District requirements. 
(5)  May not be permitted until proper documents have been recorded providing for the maintenance of the project fence and landscaping.

DIVISION 20.5. - LARGE-SCALE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 14-18 , § 2, adopted July 2, 2014, amended the Land Development Code by adding provisions designated as Div. 21, §§ 4-1560-4-1563. Inasmuch as there were already provisions so designated, and to keep alphabetical order, the new provisions have been redesignated as Div. 20.5, §§ 4-1560-4-1563, at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 4-1560. - Purpose and applicability. 
    The purpose of this division is to provide regulations for large-scale retail establishments, as defined herein. These regulations recognize that it is in the public interest to provide design standards and review processes to address the unique needs of these uses in relation to traffic circulation, community character, architectural scale, and compatibility with the adjoining neighborhoods. 
    This division provides minimum regulations for large-scale retail establishments, which are not regulated elsewhere in this chapter. 
    Provisions of this division shall apply to the following: 
(1)  New construction of a large-scale retail establishment. 
(2)  Change of use to a large-scale retail establishment. 
(3)  Building expansion, redevelopment, and/or the addition of structures to an existing development which results in the development of a large-scale retail establishment as defined herein. 
(4)  Building renovation or improvements performed over a period of five years that exceed 25 percent of the assessed value of an existing large-scale retail establishment building. 
    Compliance with these provisions will be required in order to obtain development order approval. 
(Ord. No. 14-18 , § 2, 7-2-2014; Ord. No. 14-025 , § 2, 10-15-2014) 
Sec. 4-1561. - Definitions. 
    Anchor building means a major department or chain store located within a shopping center or mall, which generally occupies the greatest amount of retail square footage on a per-tenant basis, or occupies the largest structure within the center. Shopping centers and malls may have more than one anchor building in the development. 
    Large-scale retail establishment means a shopping center, mall, or freestanding building whose primary use is, or was, a retail sales facility with at least one tenant or occupant located in a 40,000 square foot or larger building or structure, or where the total development exceeds 100,000 square feet. These establishments are commonly known as "big box stores". 
    Liner building means a building/structure oriented parallel to the adjacent street frontage in order to screen parking areas from direct view and provide activity at the pedestrian level. Liner buildings may be attached by a common wall or covered walkway, or detached from other principal structures, and may be used by a separate tenant or may be integrated into the large-scale retail establishment. 
    Patron space means commonly owned areas within a development that are strategically designed and sited exterior from the retail units to serve as a place where the public can commingle or spend time outdoors during their time shopping or visiting the large retail space and surrounding stores. It is not the intent by the inclusion of some patron space in this Land Development Code to be a requirement for patron space to be a semi-public forum, and any developer and successor has the right to have private restrictions on such use. Patron space is not limited to pervious surfaces and may contain structures and paved areas. Patron space may include but is not limited to courtyards, plazas, playgrounds, active and passive parks, and water features accompanied by outdoor seating. See 3-427. 
    Water feature means a design feature internal to the site, within and/or adjacent to a body of water, that includes fountains, waterfalls, gazebos, piers, boardwalks and decorative rocks to make the patron space enjoyable. 
(Ord. No. 14-18 , § 2, 7-2-2014) 
Sec. 4-1562. - Procedure for approval. 
(a)  Approval required. Large-scale retail establishments are permitted as part of an approved planned development or as specified in the zoning district regulations, provided there is compliance with this division. 
(b)  Existing PDs. Existing PDs may voluntarily bring a master concept plan into compliance with the regulations contained in this division administratively. Large-scale retail establishments that are approved as part of an existing PD based upon the schedule of uses and approved intensity and that are not subject to local development order approval must comply with this division. 
(c)  Deviations. The community development director may administratively approve deviations from the requirements of this division. Administrative deviations may be granted only where the director finds that the following criteria have been met: 
(1)  The alternative proposed to the standards contained herein is based on sound engineering practices. 
(2)  The alternative is no less consistent with the health, safety and welfare of abutting landowners and the general public than the standard from which the deviation is being requested; 
(3)  The granting of the deviation is not inconsistent with any specific policy directive of the city council, any other ordinance or any comprehensive plan provision.

    Unless specifically approved otherwise as part of a planned development district approval or as set forth in article VII of this chapter: 
(1)  All specified lot area, width and depth dimensions are mandatory minimums. 
a.  Exception. The director of community development may approve the subdivision of the following projects notwithstanding the noncompliance of the individual lots with property development regulations in this chapter and chapter 3; provided the overall development complies with all other applicable zoning requirements. The projects which may be approved in this matter are as follows: 
1.  The subdivision of existing commercial and industrial developments; 
2.  Commercial or industrial developments which have received a development order; 
3.  A final development order for a commercial or industrial development which is still effective; or 
4.  A new final development order application for a commercial or industrial development. 
b.  Applicants seeking such relief shall submit the following: 
1.  A detailed site plan of the overall development which indicates existing and proposed lot lines, buildings and uses, streets and accessways, off-street parking, water management facilities, buffering and open space. 
2.  A detailed listing of the section numbers and the specific regulations of this chapter, chapter 3 and/or chapter 6, if applicable, from which relief is sought. This information shall also be shown on the site plan.

Lots or yards created after August 1, 1986, shall meet at least the minimum requirements established in this chapter for the zoning district in which located. Where a lot or yard is reduced below the minimum requirements as a result of dedication, condemnation, purchase or other acquisition for a public use, the resultant nonconforming lot or yard may be required to obtain a variance in accordance with article II of this chapter. 
(4)  The following shall apply to lot width (see also the definition of lot measurement in section 4-2): 
a.  On straight streets where lot lines are perpendicular to the street right-of-way line, the terms "lot width" and "street frontage" are synonymous. 
b.  On curvilinear streets where lots may not have parallel side lot lines, a lesser street frontage may be permitted provided that the required lot width is met at the midpoints of the side lot lines. 
c.  On cul-de-sacs where irregularly shaped lots with nonparallel side lot lines occur, the street frontage may be less than the minimum required width provided that the side lot lines are radial to the center point of the cul-de-sac with a minimum angle of 45 degrees. 
d.  On lots lawfully created prior to August 1, 1986, where side lot lines are not perpendicular to the street right-of-way line and form a parallelogram or similar type lot in which the street frontage is greater than the true lot width, a permit may be issued provided all applicable setbacks are met. 
e.  On lots created after August 1, 1986, where side lot lines are not perpendicular to the street right-of-way line and form a parallelogram or similar type lot in which the street frontage is greater than the true lot width, lot width shall be measured perpendicular to the side lot line, at the required street setback line.

(a)  For purposes of this division, the term "nonconforming building or structure" means a building or structure which was lawful prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or the adoption of a revision or amendment of this chapter, but which fails, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, to conform to the proper development requirements of the zoning district in which the building or structure is located due to its size, dimension or location on the lot. 
(b)  A nonconforming building or structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Except as provided in section 4-2322, no such building or structure may be enlarged, altered or repaired in a way which, in the opinion of the department director or his designee, increases its nonconformity, but any structure or building or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. If there is more than one structure on a property with a legally nonconforming use, a limited expansion may be allowed subject to there being a determination that there will be an improvement to neighborhood compatibility. The limited expansion shall be to allow a structure or portion of a structure to be destroyed and the equivalent square footage replaced by expansion of another existing structure if the department director makes a determination that such expansion would not be detrimental to the neighborhood and such expansion is less than five percent of the current assessed value of the structure which will be expanded. Any expansion must also conform to setback requirements and all other requirements for the zoning district in which the property is located. 
(2)  Except as provided in this section: 
a.  Any nonconforming structure or building, or portion thereof, that is substantially improved (reconstructed, rehabilitated, altered or demolished) to the extent that the cost of such improvement equals or exceeds a cumulative total of 50 percent of the current assessed value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement may only be reconstructed at, but not to exceed, the lawful density or intensity existing at the time of destruction; provided, however, that the reconstruction of the structure is consistent with federal, state and local regulations and all the other provisions of this chapter.

b.  Structures which have been damaged by fire or other natural forces to the extent that the cost of their reconstruction or repair exceeds 50 percent of the replacement cost of the structure may be reconstructed at, but not to exceed, the legally documented actual use, density and intensity existing at the time of destruction, thereby allowing such structures to be rebuilt or replaced to the size, style and type of their original construction, including their original square footage; provided, however, that the affected structure, as rebuilt or replaced, complies with all applicable federal and state regulations, local building and life safety regulations, and other local regulations which do not preclude reconstruction otherwise intended by the Bonita Plan and Ordinance No. 90-61, as amended from time to time. 
(3)  A lawfully existing single-family residence or mobile home damaged by fire or other natural forces may be repaired or replaced, provided the new unit is no larger in area, width and depth than the size of unit being replaced. 
(4)  Repairs, reconstruction or renewal of an existing structure, building or portion thereof for the purpose of its maintenance may be permitted. However, repairs, reconstruction or renewal of structural elements will be reviewed by community development to determine applicability under this section, or whether such repairs will be considered under subsection (b)(2)a of this section. For purposes of this section, a change in the roofline from a flat roof to a peaked roof constitutes an alteration as indicated in subsection (b)(2)a of this section, provided that there is no increase in floor area. 
(5)  Should a nonconforming structure be moved on site for any reason, for any distance whatever, it may not be moved unless the relocation decreases the nonconformity. 
(6)  Any portion of a nonconforming structure that becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and which is declared unsafe or unlawful by a duly authorized city official, but which the owner wishes to repair, restore or rebuild, must be repaired, restored or rebuilt in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Excluded from this provision are buildings that have been designated as historic by chapter 5.

(2)  Discontinuance. When a nonconforming use of a building, land, or building and land in combination is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months (except when government action impedes access to the land), the building, or building and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. This subsection shall not apply to seasonal agricultural uses. 
(3)  Repair and maintenance. 
a.  Only ordinary repairs and maintenance, including repair or replacement of roof covering, walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, shall be permitted on any building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use. In no case shall such repairs include structural alterations. 
b.  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations for the district in which located.

DIVISION 3. - CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS 

Sec. 5-82. - Required. 
    No building, moving or demolition permit shall be issued for a designated historic resource, or a building, structure or site which is part of a designated historic or archaeological district, until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued. Except for applications requesting certificates of appropriateness for noncontributing properties, the criteria for issuance of a certificate of appropriateness (regular or special) shall be the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, 36 CFR 67, as such standards may be amended, renumbered or replaced, which are hereby adopted by reference as though set forth fully in this article. Applications for certificates of appropriateness for noncontributing properties shall be reviewed using the specific criteria set out in the resolution designating the historic district where the property is located. 
(Ord. No. 02-05, § 1(22-101), 4-17-2002; Ord. No. 06-08, § 1(5-101), 8-16-2006; Ord. No. 09-02, § 1(5-101), 3-4-2009; Ord. No. 13-20, § 1(5-101), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 5-83. - Regular certificate of appropriateness. 
(a)  A regular certificate of appropriateness shall be required for work requiring a building permit and classified as ordinary maintenance and repair by this chapter, or for any work that will result, to the satisfaction of the city staff, in the close resemblance in appearance of the building, architectural feature or landscape feature to its appearance when it was built or was likely to have been built, or to its appearance as it presently exists so long as the present appearance is appropriate to the style and materials. 
(b)  The historic preservation board staff shall, administratively, within five working days from the date a complete application has been filed with the community development department, approve, deny or approve with conditions, an application for a regular certificate of appropriateness presented by the owner of a designated historic resource or a property within a designated historic district. No hearing before the historic preservation board shall be required. The written findings of the staff shall be mailed by first class mail to the applicant and to the members of the historic preservation board within two working days of the staff decision, accompanied by a statement explaining the decision. The applicant shall have an opportunity to appeal the staff decision by applying for a special certificate of appropriateness within 30 calendar days of the date that the decision is issued. 
(Ord. No. 02-05, § 1(22-102), 4-17-2002; Ord. No. 06-08, § 1(5-102), 8-16-2006; Ord. No. 09-02, § 1(5-102), 3-4-2009; Ord. No. 13-20, § 1(5-102), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 5-84. - Special certificate of appropriateness. 
(a)  Required. A special certificate of appropriateness shall be issued by the historic preservation board prior to initiation of any work involving alteration, demolition, relocation, reconstruction, excavation or new construction which will result in a change to the original appearance of a designated historic resource or a contributing property within a designated historic district. A special certificate of appropriateness is also required prior to any new construction, reconstruction or alteration of a noncontributing property within a designated historic district. A special certificate of appropriateness may also be issued to reverse or modify a staff decision regarding an application for a regular certificate of appropriateness or a conditional certificate to dig. 
(b)  Application. An applicant for a special certificate of appropriateness shall submit an application to the community development department, accompanied by two sets of full plans and specifications, a site plan and, in the case of sites involving buildings or structures, samples of materials as may be deemed appropriate and requested by the historic preservation board to fully describe the proposed appearance, color, texture, materials or design of the building or structure and any outbuilding, wall, courtyard, fence, landscape feature, paving, signage or exterior lighting. The applicant shall provide adequate information to enable the historic preservation board to visualize the effect of the proposed action on the historic resource and on adjacent buildings and streetscapes within a historic district. Alterations shall achieve the purpose of the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings. 
(c)  Public hearing. The historic preservation board shall hold a public hearing upon an application for a special certificate of appropriateness affecting designated historic resources or districts. Notice of the public hearing shall be given to the property owners by certified mail, return receipt requested, and to other interested parties by posting a copy of such notice at the premises, at city hall, and upon the city's website or other electronic media at least five calendar days but no sooner than 20 calendar days prior to the date of hearing. 
(d)  Action of historic preservation board. The historic preservation board shall meet and act upon an application for a special certificate of appropriateness on or within 70 calendar days from the date the application and materials adequately describing the proposed action are received. The historic preservation board shall approve, deny or approve the special certificate of appropriateness with conditions, subject to the acceptance of the conditions by the applicant, or suspend action on the application for a period not to exceed 35 calendar days in order to seek technical advice from outside sources or to meet further with the applicant to revise or modify the application. Failure of the historic preservation board to act upon an application on or within 70 calendar days (if no additional information is required) or 105 calendar days (if additional information is required by the historic preservation board) from the date the application was received shall result in the immediate issuance of the special certificate of appropriateness applied for, without further action by the historic preservation board. 
(e)  Notice of decision. All decisions of the historic preservation board shall be in writing and shall include findings of fact. Evidence of approval of the application shall be by the special certificate of appropriateness issued by the historic preservation board or the board's designated staff representative. Notice of a decision shall be given to the applicant and to the building official, the zoning director and any other appropriate public agency, as determined by the historic preservation board. When an application is denied, the notice of the historic preservation board shall provide an adequate written explanation of its decision to deny the application. The historic preservation board shall keep a record of its actions under this chapter. Any appeal may be pursued using the procedure set forth in section 4-53, pertaining to appeals from administrative matters. 
(Ord. No. 02-05, § 1(22-103), 4-17-2002; Ord. No. 06-08, § 1(5-103), 8-16-2006; Ord. No. 09-02, § 1(5-103), 3-4-2009; Ord. No. 13-20, § 1(5-103), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 5-85. - Demolition of a designated historic resource or a contributing property. 
(a)  Demolition of a designated historic resource or a contributing property within a designated historic district may only occur pursuant to an order of a governmental body or board or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction and pursuant to approval of an application by the owner for a special certificate of appropriateness for demolition. 
(b)  Governmental agencies having the authority to demolish unsafe structures shall receive notice of the designation of historic resources and districts pursuant to article III of this chapter. The historic preservation board shall be deemed an interested party and shall be entitled to receive notice of any public hearings conducted by such agencies regarding demolition of any designated historic resource or contributing property to a designated historic district. The historic preservation board may make recommendations and suggestions to the governmental agency and the owner relative to the feasibility of and the public interest in preserving the designated resource. 
(c)  No permit for voluntary demolition of a designated historic resource or contributing site within a historic district shall be issued to the owner thereof until an application for a special certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to the historic preservation board and approved pursuant to the procedures in this article. The historic preservation board shall approve, deny or approve with conditions the application for a special certificate of appropriateness for demolition. Refusal by the historic preservation board to grant a special certificate of appropriateness for demolition shall be evidenced by a written order detailing the public interest that is sought to be preserved. The historic preservation board may grant a special certificate of appropriateness for demolition, which may provide for a delayed effective date of six months to allow the historic preservation board to seek possible alternatives to demolition. During the demolition delay period the historic preservation board may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve the structure concerned, in accordance with the purpose of this chapter. Such steps may include, but shall not be limited to, consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens, recommendations for acquisition of property by public or private bodies or agencies, and exploration of the possibility of moving the building or other feature. 
(d)  The historic preservation board shall consider the following criteria in evaluating applications for certificates of appropriateness for demolition of designated historic resources or contributing properties within a designated historic district: 
(1)  Is the building or structure of such interest or quality that it would reasonably meet national, state or local criteria for additional designation as a historic or architectural landmark? 
(2)  Is the building or structure of such design, craftsmanship or material that it could be reproduced only with great difficulty or expense? 
(3)  Is the building or structure one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, the city or the region? 
(4)  Does the building or structure contribute significantly to the historic character of a designated historic district? 
(5)  Would retention of the building or structure promote the general welfare of the city by providing an opportunity for the study of local history or prehistory, architecture and design or by developing an understanding of the importance and value of a particular culture and heritage? 
(6)  Are there definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what will be the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area? 
(7)  Has demolition of the designated building or structure been ordered by the appropriate public agency due to unsafe conditions? 
(e)  Unless demolition has been ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or another governmental body, the fire marshal or the building official, a special certificate of appropriateness for demolition of a designated building or structure shall not be issued until there are definite plans for reuse of the property and a building permit or development order for the new construction has been applied for. 
(f)  If an undue economic hardship is claimed by the property owner as a result of the denial of a special certificate of appropriateness for demolition, the historic preservation board shall have the power to vary or modify adherence to its original decision no later than 35 calendar days from the date the original decision is issued. Any variance or modification of a prior order shall be based upon sufficient evidence submitted by the owner and a subsequent finding by the historic preservation board that retention of the building or structure would deny the owner of all economically viable use of the property, thus creating an undue economic hardship. The owner may present the following evidence as grounds for such a finding: 
(1)  For all property, the owner may present: 
a.  The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the party from whom purchased; 
b.  The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon according to the two most recent property tax assessments; 
c.  The amount of real estate taxes for the previous two years; 
d.  The annual debt service, if any for the previous two years; 
e.  All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of the property; 
f.  Any listings of the property for sale or lease, the price asked and offers received, if any; and 
g.  Any profitable adaptive uses for the property which have been considered by the owner. 
(2)  In addition to the items set forth in subsection (f)(1) of this section, the owner may present, for income-producing property: 
a.  The annual gross income from the property for the previous two years; 
b.  Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years; and 
c.  The annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two years. 
(Ord. No. 02-05, § 1(22-104), 4-17-2002; Ord. No. 06-08, § 1(5-104), 8-16-2006; Ord. No. 09-02, § 1(5-104), 3-4-2009; Ord. No. 13-20, § 1(5-104), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 5-86. - Moving permits. 
    The historic preservation board shall consider the following criteria for applications for special certificates of appropriateness for the moving of all historic resources and contributing properties located within a designated historic district: 
(1)  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building or structure contributes to its present setting. 
(2)  The reasons for the proposed move. 
(3)  The proposed new setting and the general environment of the proposed new setting. 
(4)  Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity. 
(5)  Whether the proposed relocation site is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building or structure. 
(6)  When applicable, the effect of the move on the distinctive historical and visual character of a designated historic district. 
(Ord. No. 02-05, § 1(22-105), 4-17-2002; Ord. No. 06-08, § 1(5-105), 8-16-2006; Ord. No. 09-02, § 1(5-105), 3-4-2009; Ord. No. 13-20, § 1(5-105), 12-18-2013) 
Sec. 5-87. - Archaeological sites and districts. 
(a)  Designation. The survey entitled "An Archaeological Site Inventory and Zone Management Plan for Lee County, Florida" (Piper Archaeological Research, Inc., 1987) and "Historic Resources Survey of Bonita Springs, Final Report" (also known as "The Janus Report") (October, 2004), shall be used as the initial database when considering the designation of areas of archaeological sensitivity level 1. 
(b)  Certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required prior to the issuance of a building permit for activity within an archaeological site or district designated pursuant to this chapter. An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by two sets of full plans and specifications indicating areas of work that might affect the surface and subsurface of the archaeological site. 
(1)  The requirements outlined in article III of this chapter shall apply to all applications and the issuance of all certificates of appropriateness for archaeological sites and districts designated pursuant to this chapter. 
(2)  In reviewing the application for a special certificate of appropriateness for a designated archaeological site, the historic preservation board may also require any or all of the following: 
a.  Scientific excavation and evaluation of the site by an archaeologist at the owner's expense. 
b.  An archaeological survey, conducted by an archaeologist, containing an analysis of the impact of the proposed activity on the archaeological site. 
c.  Proposal for mitigation measures. 
d.  Protection or preservation of all or part of the designated archaeological site for green space, in exchange for incentives as provided in article III, division 2 of this chapter. 
(3)  To knowingly disturb human burial remains is a third degree felony in the state, pursuant to F.S. ch. 872, pertaining to offenses concerning dead bodies and graves. The law includes prehistoric as well as historic period interments, and aboriginal burial mounds or cemeteries as well as historic period cemeteries. Procedures for dealing with the accidental discovery of unmarked human burials are outlined in F.S. ch. 872. If unmarked human burials are suspected or known in an area under consideration for any certificate of appropriateness, the area shall be surveyed by a professional archaeologist to locate such remains. Procedures for dealing with human remains shall be carried out according to F.S. ch. 872. Any located human interments should be preserved in place if at all possible. If it is necessary to excavate or otherwise move the remains, every effort shall be made to identify and contact persons who may have a direct kinship, tribal, community or ethnic relationship with the deceased in order to arrange for their appropriate reinternment or disposition. 
(c)  Certificate to dig. The survey entitled "An Archaeological Site Inventory and Zone Management Plan for Lee County, Florida" and "Historic Resources Survey of Bonita Springs, Final Report" (also known as "The Janus Report") (October, 2004), shall be used to identify areas of archaeological sensitivity levels 1 and 2. 
(1)  A certificate to dig shall be required prior to or in conjunction with the issuance of a final development order for activity within any area recorded on the Florida Master Site File or of archaeological sensitivity levels 1 and 2 that may involve new construction, filling, digging, removal of trees or any other activity that may alter or reveal an interred archaeological site. If submerged or wetland areas, such as ponds, sloughs or swamps, are also to be damaged by development or by dredge and fill activities, these shall also be assessed for their potential to contain significant archaeological sites. 
(2)  The purpose of a certificate to dig shall be to allow sufficient time to conduct any necessary investigations, including the location, evaluation and protection of significant archaeological sites in areas suspected of having such archaeological sites. 
(3)  The staff of the historic preservation board shall, within 15 calendar days of receipt of a complete application for a certificate to dig, approve the application for a certificate to dig, or approve the certificate to dig subject to specified conditions, including, but not limited to, a delay not to exceed 60 days to allow any necessary site excavation or additional archaeological assessment prior to commencement of the proposed construction activity. The staff's decision shall be based on the application and any other guidelines which the historic preservation board may establish. If the approved certificate to dig requires archaeological excavation, the certificate shall specify a period of time during which excavation shall occur, not to exceed 60 days unless the owner agrees to an extension. The owner shall have an archaeologist conduct excavations as necessary during this period. The certificate to dig and any staff findings shall be mailed to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, within seven calendar days of its review and approval. Copies of the certificate to dig shall also be provided to the historic preservation board members. 
(4)  The applicant shall have the opportunity to appeal any conditions attached to a certificate to dig by applying for a special certificate of appropriateness within 30 calendar days of the date the conditional certificate to dig is issued. The historic preservation board shall convene no later than 50 calendar days after the date a completed application for a special certificate of appropriateness is filed with the staff. Approved certificates to dig shall contain an effective date not to exceed 60 calendar days, at which time the proposed activity may begin, unless the archaeological excavation should uncover evidence of such significance that it warrants designation of the archaeological site as a historic resource pursuant to article III of this chapter. 
(5)  All work performed pursuant to the issuance of a certificate to dig shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. It shall be the duty of the appropriate city agencies and the staff of the historic preservation board to inspect work for compliance with such certificate. In the event of noncompliance the appropriate city staff shall have the power to issue a stop work order and all work shall cease. 
(Ord. No. 02-05, § 1(22-106), 4-17-2002; Ord. No. 06-08, § 1(5-106), 8-16-2006; Ord. No. 09-02, § 1(5-106), 3-4-2009; Ord. No. 13-20, § 1(5-106), 12-18-2013; Ord. No. 17-05 , § 1, 4-19-17) 
Sec. 5-88. - Waiting period for demolition of recognized historic resources. 
(a)  Permits to demolish any building or structure, or any portions thereof, determined by the historic preservation board to be, and listed as, a recognized historic resource as defined by this chapter, shall not be issued until the expiration of a maximum of 90 days measured from the date of the filing of the demolition permit application with the city. The purpose of this restriction shall be to enable the historic preservation board to pursue alternatives to demolition and to assemble and document information with the property owner or owners of the recognized historic resource pertaining to the appearance and history of the building or structure prior to its demolition. Upon the filing with the city, through its community development department, of an application for a permit to demolish a recognized historic resource, or any portions thereof, notice of such filing shall immediately be given to the historic preservation board's staff liaison for an expedited hearing. 
(b)  A demolition permit for a building or structure, or for any portions thereof, that has a Florida Master Site File and/or is 50 years of age or older, and has been determined by the historic preservation board to be, and listed as, a recognized historic resource, may not be issued prior to the expiration of a maximum of 90 days measured from the date of the filing of the demolition permit application with the city, unless the historic preservation board, in its opinion, determines sooner that no cause exists to further delay the issuance of such demolition permit, based upon a finding that either no alternatives to, or delays for, demolition are any longer necessary, practicable or required; or that substantial economic hardship will result to the property owner or owners by reason of any further delay in demolition; or that the building or structure has been substantially destroyed or damaged by an event not within the property owners' control with more than 50 percent of the building or structure affected. 
(c)  The demolition application shall be forwarded from the city's community development department, immediately after its filing, to the historic preservation board's staff liaison for consideration. Unless waived by the property owner or owners, the property owner or owners will be notified not less than ten days after the filing of the demolition application, by certified mail, of the delay imposed, and of the date, time and place of the next regularly scheduled meeting, or special meeting called, of the historic preservation board, at which the property owner or owners shall be given an opportunity to be heard, on an expedited basis, in order to contest and/or limit such delay. If, after submission of demolition application, property owner or owners request(s) an opportunity to be heard to contest and/or limit a delay, a hearing shall take place no later than 30 days after the ten-day notification has been provided by certified mail. 
(d)  At the next regularly scheduled meeting, or special meeting called, of the historic preservation board the property owner or owners may request that the historic preservation board waive or limit the demolition delay and determine that no cause exists to further withhold the issuance of such demolition permit, based upon a finding that either no alternatives to, or delays for, demolition are any longer necessary, practicable or required; or that undue economic hardship will result to the property owner or owners by reason of any further delay in demolition; or that the building or structure has been substantially destroyed or damaged by an event not within the property owners' control with more than 50 percent of the building or structure affected. 
(e)  In the event that undue economic hardship due to the effect of the demolition delay is claimed by a property owner or owners, the historic preservation board may give consideration to the economic impact of the delay upon the property owner or owners and the reasonableness of the property owner or owners carrying out the decision of the board. In doing so, the historic preservation board may require from the property owner or owners to demonstrate undue economic hardship, and may require that such property owner or owners provide sufficient information before it makes a decision on the application, as long as such information is relevant for the historic preservation board to decide whether an undue economic hardship exists. 
(f)  In the event that undue economic hardship due to the effect of the demolition delay is claimed by a property owner or owners of income-producing property, the historic preservation board may also require any other information considered necessary by the historic preservation board to a determination as to whether the property does yield or may yield a reasonable return to the owner or owners. 
(g)  For the purpose of making available to owners of property for which a demolition waiting period has been invoked pursuant to this section, the historic preservation board shall maintain a list of qualified interested parties, such as Florida licensed contractors, as defined in F.S. § 489.105(3), and possessing an appropriate division 1 contractors license or a local certificate of competency for demolition contracting issued by Lee County, and preservationists specializing in relocation and salvage of historic structures. 
(h)  If an undue economic hardship is claimed by the property owner or owners as a result of the demolition delay, the historic preservation board shall have the power to modify adherence to its original decision. Any modification of a prior order shall be based upon sufficient evidence submitted by the owner and a subsequent finding by the historic preservation board that retention of the building or structure would deny the owner of all economically viable use of the property, thus creating an undue economic hardship. 
(i)  If an undue economic hardship is claimed by the property owner or owners as a result of the demolition delay, the historic preservation board shall have the power to modify adherence to its original decision. Any modification of a prior order shall be based upon sufficient evidence submitted by the owner and a subsequent finding by the historic preservation board that retention of the building or structure would deny the owner of all economically viable use of the property, thus creating an undue economic hardship. 
(j)  Any decision of the historic preservation board in requiring a demolition delay may be appealed to the city council by filing a written request within 15 days after the decision has been made. In reviewing such an appeal, city council shall consider the information submitted for the historic preservation board to base their decision, the facts presented, and any new information that could have affected the decision. Prior to filing any claims under the Bert J. Harris, Jr., Private Property Rights Protection Act, a property owner or owners must apply for an exemption to consider having exhausted his, hers or their administrative remedies under this section before a cause of action or "action of a governmental entity" will accrue or be deemed ripe. Such exhaustion shall not include a filing for an appeal or a petition for writ of certiorari in circuit court.

Sec. 5-206. - Ordinary maintenance and repair. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or discourage the ordinary maintenance and repair of the exterior elements of any historic resource or any property within a designated historic district when such maintenance and repair do not involve a change of design, appearance (other than color) or material, and do not require a building permit. Any proposed change to the exterior colors of a designated historic resource, or a contributing property within a designated historic district as may be created and located within the Old 41 Redevelopment overlay, shall conform to the provisions of section 4-869(3)e.4(c)(5), as may be amended, renumbered or replaced, relating to the Old 41 Redevelopment design standards, and shall be reviewed and approved by the city's architect in accordance with any designated color palette adopted by city council.

Such temporary construction, reconstruction or demolition must take place pursuant to permission granted by the building official, and only such work as is reasonably necessary to correct the emergency conditions may be carried out. The owner of a building or structure damaged by fire or natural calamity will be permitted to immediately stabilize the building or structure and to later rehabilitate it under the procedures required by this chapter.

The owner shall have until the time of the public hearing to make necessary repairs to rectify the evidence of neglect as identified in the certified notice. Upon failure by the owner to abate the structural, health or safety hazards identified in the initial notice within 45 calendar days, the historic preservation board shall hold a public hearing to consider recommending to the building official that the owner be issued a citation for code violation.

Footnotes:

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 6-1. - Purpose and intent of chapter. 
(a)  Generally. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to: 
(1)  Facilitate the implementation of goals, objectives and policies set forth in the city comprehensive plan relating to sign control and protection of areas from incompatible uses. 
(2)  Promote convenience, safety, property values and aesthetics, by establishing a set of standards for the erection, placement, use and maintenance of signs which will grant equal protection and fairness to all property owners in the city. 
(3)  Encourage signs which help to visually organize the activities of the city, lend order, identification, and place-making, creating identifiable destinations for the public and businesses. 
(4)  Establish regulations to promote signs that have lighting elements that focus to the city's "dark skies" provisions, balancing the need for the public to find the sign but not to create light pollution and glare. 
(b)  Protection of public safety. The regulation of the placement, installation and maintenance of signs is justified by the innate scheme and primary purpose to draw mental attention to them, potentially to the detriment of sound driving practices and the safety of the motoring public to which a majority of signs are oriented. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter to regulate the size and location of signs so that their purpose can be served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions. 
(c)  Protection of property values and aesthetics. The aesthetic impact of signs is an economic fact which may bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property. The fact that signs are intended to command visual contact grants them a proportionately greater role than other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community. Therefore, the regulation of signs is further justified on the basis that the city has an obligation to promote the general welfare, including enhancement of property values, so as to create a more attractive business climate and make the city a more desirable place in which to visit, trade, work and live. 
(d)  Equal protection and fairness. This chapter is designed to be fair to each property owner in that each receives equal and adequate exposure to the public and no one is allowed to visually dominate his neighbor. 
(e)  Use. With the stated purpose in mind, it is the intention of this chapter to authorize the use of signs in commercial and industrial areas which are: 
(1)  Compatible with their surroundings; 
(2)  Appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain; 
(3)  An expression of the identity of the individual proprietors or of the community as a whole; and 
(4)  Large enough to sufficiently convey a message about the owner or occupants of a particular property, the commodities, products or services available on such property, or the business activities conducted on such property, yet small enough to prevent excessive, overpowering advertising which would have a detrimental effect on the character and appearance of commercial and industrial areas, or which could unduly distract the motoring public causing unsafe motoring conditions. 
(f)  Limitations. It is also the intent of this chapter to limit signs in noncommercial areas to essential uses, primarily for identification and information, in order to protect the character and appearance of noncommercial areas.

Sec. 6-8. - Removal of unlawful or dangerous signs. 
    All signs and sign structures which are or have been erected or maintained unlawfully shall be considered illegal and subject to the following removal procedures: 
(1)  Banners, promotional signs, sidewalk or sandwich signs and snipe signs. 
a.  The city council finds that, in view of the inexpensive nature of these signs and the administrative burden which would be imposed by elaborate procedural prerequisites prior to removal, any procedure other than summary removal of these signs when unlawfully erected and maintained would defeat the purpose of regulating such signs. Therefore, the city manager or designee is hereby authorized summarily to remove such signs when unlawfully erected and maintained, subject to the provisions contained in subsection (2) of this section. 
b.  After summary removal of a sign pursuant to this section, the city manager or designee shall notify, either in person or by first class postage, prepaid, the occupant of the property from which the sign was removed, and, if the sign identified a party other than the occupant of the property, the party so identified. The notice shall advise that the sign has been removed, and shall state that the sign may be retrieved within 30 days of the date of the notice and that if the sign is not retrieved within 30 days it will be disposed of by the city. If the sign is removed from public property, the party, if any, identified on the sign shall be notified; if no party is identified on the sign, then no notice prior to disposition is required. The city shall dispose of all unclaimed signs after the expiration of the 30-day period. 
(2)  Other unlawful signs. Signs which are or have been erected or maintained unlawfully but do not fall under the provisions set forth in subsection (1) of this section shall be subject to the following procedures: 
a.  The city manager or designee shall prepare a notice which shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved, and which shall state that, if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within 15 days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
b.  All notices mailed by the city manager or designee shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail. 
c.  The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located as shown on the Lee County Property Appraisers current roll. If the owner of the sign and the occupant of the property are known, or with reasonable care should be known, the notice shall be mailed to or delivered to the owner of the sign and the occupant of the property. 
d.  Failing determination of the sign owner or user or owner of the property on which the sign is located, the notice may be affixed in a conspicuous place to the sign or to the business premises with which the sign is associated. The city manager or designee shall require new sign permits to be issued for each existing sign classified as a legal nonconforming sign. A photograph of each sign so classified shall be attached to the city's copy of the permit application. 
e.  Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the administrator ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the city within 15 days after the date of receiving the notice. 
f.  Upon completion of the notification procedures and after expiration of the 15-day appeal period, if no appeal has been filed, the city manager or designee shall have the authority to remove or contract with a contractor to remove the unlawful sign. All costs associated with the removal of the unlawful sign shall be assessed against the property owner. Each such assessment shall be a lien against the property until paid, in accordance with subsection (4) of this section. 
(3)  Emergency work. When it is determined by the city manager or designee that a sign would cause an imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be made with a sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served. In this emergency situation, the city manager or designee may take reasonable steps to correct the danger, with all costs being assessed against the property owner. 
(4)  Assessment of costs. 
a.  As soon after the offending condition is corrected or removed by the city manager or designee and the expense thereof can be finally determined, the city manager or designee shall render a statement to the property owner or permittee or person having possession or right to use, by regular United States mail, addressed to the last known address of any of such persons, informing the person of the sums due the city. 
b.  If such sums are not paid within 45 days, the city council shall, by resolution, levy a special assessment lien in the amount of all sums due the city, plus interest on the amount at a rate of 12 percent per annum, plus all expenses which may be incurred incident to the enforcement of such lien, including any court costs or attorney's fees, until final payment of all sums have been made. 
c.  Liens shall be recorded in the official records of the county and shall remain in full force and effect until finally paid. The city council shall furnish releases of the subject lien upon proper satisfaction having been made. The lien may be enforced in the manner provided by the general law of the state for the enforcement of liens or the foreclosure of mortgages.

(b)  Upon being denied a permanent sign permit, a property owner may apply for a special exception in accordance with chapter 4 except as modified by this section. 
(1)  A special exception from the terms of this chapter will be considered by city council if a written request for a sign special exception has been submitted demonstrating: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist such as, but not limited to, building orientation, vehicular circulation or vision obstructions (not to include landscaping) that are peculiar to the land, structure, or building that create a site specific justification for the exception; 
b.  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property of lands, structures or buildings of similar character with identical special circumstances (nonconforming signs shall not be grounds for issuing sign special exceptions), or alternatively, that a special exception from the provisions of this chapter is warranted and justified to protect, preserve, or enhance the city's tax base or to prevent or eradicate conditions of economic blight; 
c.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action of the applicant; 
d.  That the sign special exception to be granted is the minimum measure needed to address the special conditions and circumstances that justify the special exception; and 
e.  That the sign special exception will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or surrounding property, and will not otherwise detrimental to safe and convenient use of nearby rights-of-way; 
f.  that all other signage on the property is in substantial compliance with this chapter, as applied. 
(2)  City council may grant special exception signage different than that contemplated by this sign code and may require that such exceptional signage be removed and signage in conformance with this sign ordinance substituted therefore if the circumstances giving rise to the need for such special exception no longer continues to exist. Further, the city may limit or prohibit other signage which establishment might otherwise be allowed under the terms of this sign code as a condition precedent to granting such special exception signage. 
(3)  This process is available for all permanent signs except billboards. Special exceptions will not be considered for temporary signs. 
(4)  The applicant shall have the burden of proof, which shall include the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion on all issues, which are to be determined by city council.

Sec. 6-39. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  A sign falls under one of the following categories: 
(1)  A nonconforming sign which was legally erected prior to regulations currently in effect, but which does not conform to the regulations as currently in place. 
(2)  A legal sign, which conforms to the regulations that are currently in effect. 
(3)  An illegal sign, which was never allowed or has lost its nonconforming status. 
    All nonconforming signs shall be subject to the provisions of this section. 
(b)  A nonconforming sign may not be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
(c)  Loss of nonconformity. A nonconforming sign shall become an illegal sign which shall not be replaced or repaired, in part or in full, except upon full compliance with this chapter when: 
(1)  The sign is altered or relocated in any manner which increases its nonconformity or causes it to be less in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  A sign will lose its nonconforming status if it makes copy changes of 25 percent or more of the total copy area of the original sign in any 12-month period. The act of more than 25 percent change within this timeframe will create a loss of nonconformity and require new permitting in accordance with this sign code. 
(3)  More than 25 percent of the copy area is removed or unassembled for a period of more than six months. 
(4)  When a sign face remains blank, which is defined as void of advertising matter, for a period of six months it loses its nonconforming status. Signs displaying an "available for lease" message or similar message and partially obliterated signs which do not identify a particular product, service, facility or active business are considered to be blank signs. 
(5)  A change in copy or an alteration which increases its nonconformity, other than on a changeable copy sign. 
(6)  Any structural repair or refurbishing of a nonconforming sign that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the sign in its preexisting state. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to provide the city with adequate proof of the cost of such work in the form of an itemized statement of the direct repair cost, whenever such information is requested by the city. 
(d)  Any sign that loses its nonconforming status shall be immediately brought into compliance with this chapter, or the sign shall be removed. 
(e)  The existence of an illegal sign or a legal nonconforming sign does not constitute a hardship warranting the issuance of a variance from the provisions of this chapter. 
(f)  This section is not applicable to billboard structures. The requirements for replacement of billboard structures is addressed in section 6-148, and provided that a billboard structure meets the requirements of section 6-148, may be replaced in accordance with that section.

(Ord. No. 01-06, § 1(14-78), 4-4-2001) 
Sec. 7-48. - Guidelines for mitigation and abatement of prohibited artificial lighting. 
(a)  Appropriate techniques to achieve lighting compliance include, but are not limited to, fitting lights with hoods or shields, utilizing recessed or down fixtures with low wattage bulbs, screening light with vegetation or other ground-level barriers, directing light away from sea turtle nesting habitat, utilizing low-profile lighting, turning off artificial light during the nesting season, motion detectors set on the minimum duration, spraying reflective surfaces within fixtures or globes on fixtures with a flat black grill or oven paint, and lowering the light intensity of the lamps to 25-watt yellow bug lights. Although plastic sleeves for fluorescent bulbs may help to reduce the amount of artificial light to an acceptable level if the bulbs are of sufficiently low wattage, additional shielding is still required as sea turtles are more sensitive to the wavelengths of fluorescent light. 
(b)  Opaque shields for lights covering an arc of at least 180 degrees and extending an appropriate distance below the bottom edge of the fixture on its seaward side may be installed so that the light source or any reflective surface of the light fixture is not visible from a sea turtle nesting habitat. 
(c)  Floodlights, uplights, spotlights, and decorative lighting directly, indirectly, or cumulatively visible from sea turtle nesting habitat should not be used during the nesting season. 
(d)  Appropriate techniques to eliminate interior lighting directly, indirectly, or cumulatively illuminating the beach, include, but are not limited to, applying window tint film to windows, using tinted glass, moving light fixtures away from windows, closing blinds or curtains, and turning off unnecessary lights.

ARTICLE III. - BALD EAGLES 

Sec. 7-72. - Purpose of article. 
    In order to maintain a stable or increasing population of the bald eagle in Bonita Springs by protecting eagle habitat, it is necessary and appropriate to protect, enhance, and preserve the nest of the eagle and its immediate environs. With reasonable land compensation incentives and proper habitat management, the bald eagle population in the city can be maintained. This article is intended to protect the critical nesting habitat of the bald eagle and promote national, state, and community pride and esteem by negotiating with owners of land surrounding eagle nests to provide an optimal management plan for land subject to imminent development, including providing special compensation incentives to private property owners for loss of property committed to critical bald eagle nesting habitat. This article is also intended to provide information and assistance to property owners to enable them to avoid violations of city, county, state and federal law. 
(Ord. No. 10-05, § 1(7-111), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 7-73. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Abandoned nest means a nest that is intact or partially intact but has been inactive through five or more consecutive nesting seasons. 
    Active nest means a nest that shows or showed evidence of breeding by bald eagles, such as an adult attending the nest or in incubating position, a clutch of eggs, or a brood of nestlings, at any time during the current or most recent nesting season. 
    Agricultural activities means bona fide farm operations as defined in the Florida Right to Farm Act, F.S. § 823.14. 
    Alternate nest means a nest that is intact or partially intact and has been used by bald eagles at any time during the past five nesting seasons, but was not used during the current or most recent nesting season. An inactive nest is considered to be an alternate nest until it has been inactive for five consecutive nesting seasons, at which time it becomes an abandoned nest. 
    Bald eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) means a mature eagle with white plumage on its head and tail feathers, or an immature eagle with dark plumage, which resides throughout the state around estuarine areas and along the lakes and river drainage basins within the interior of the state, county and city. 
    Buffer area means a natural or manmade area designated by the city council in accordance with section 7-79 that must remain predominantly in its natural or created native vegetated state to protect eagles, nest trees, or other critical eagle nesting habitat. Buffer areas may range in any distance averaging 660 feet from a nest and be irregularly shaped areas, except that a larger buffer area may be offered voluntarily in accordance with section 7-80(3). 
    Critical eagle nesting habitat means habitat which, if lost, could result in the elimination of nesting eagles from the area in question. Critical eagle nesting habitat typically provides functions for the bald eagle during the nesting portion of that species' life cycle. This area includes eagle nest trees and their immediate environs and may include other areas or features such as perch trees, flight paths, and alternate nests within the buffer area. 
    Disturb means to agitate or bother a bald eagle to a degree that causes or is likely to cause, based on the best scientific information available: 
(1)  Injury to the eagle; 
(2)  A decrease in its productivity by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding or sheltering behavior; or 
(3)  Nest abandonment by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding or sheltering behavior. 
    Fledgling means a young eagle that is capable of flight and has left the nest, usually at ten to 12 weeks of age. Fledglings may return to the nest for several weeks to be fed or to roost. 
    Flight path means the route within the buffer area most frequently traveled by eagles directly to and from their nest, perch trees, and important foraging areas. 
    Foraging area means the location where eagles feed, typically near open waters such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and bays where fish and waterfowl are abundant, or in area with little or no water where prey species are abundant (e.g., rabbit, rodents or carrion). 
    FWC means the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or its successor. 
    Inactive nest means a nest that was not used during the current or most recent nesting season. 
    Lost nest means a nest where the nest or nest tree is destroyed by natural causes (e.g., nest that fell apart or was blown out of a tree, or tree itself was lost) and is not rebuilt in the same tree within three nesting seasons. 
    Nesting season means the period from October 1 to May 15, unless the young fledge before or after May 15 as determined by city environmental sciences staff. 
    Nestling means a young eagle (eaglet) that is incapable of flight and is dependent on its parents. Once an eaglet fledges (i.e., leaves the nest), it becomes a fledgling. 
    Perch tree means a tree used by bald eagles for resting, sleeping, foraging, hunting, feeding, lookout, display or thermal benefit. 
    Unified control has the same meaning as defined in chapter 4 and chapter 9. 
    USFWS means the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or its successor.

(Ord. No. 10-05, § 1(7-117), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 7-78. - Notification procedure. 
    The city will notify the FWC and the USFWS upon receipt of any application for a planned development rezoning, a development order, a notice of clearing, or a building permit for any property located within 660 feet of a nest. The notice must include any available information gathered regarding the behavior of the eagles that are occupying the nest. 
(Ord. No. 10-05, § 1(7-118), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 7-79. - Mechanisms for the protection of critical eagle nesting habitat. 
(a)  Construction of single- or two-family dwelling unit (including accessory structures.) Appropriate conditions limiting or prohibiting development during the nesting season may be attached to building permit approvals for property to which this article is applicable where such conditions are deemed necessary by the director of the department of community development (or designee) to prevent a loss of critical eagle nesting habitat. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, distances from the nest, defining the dates, equipment, and hours of operation for exterior construction to avoid disturbing nesting eagles, eggs or nestlings. 
(b)  Agricultural activities. All persons intending to conduct new agricultural activities on property to which this article is applicable must consult with city staff prior to approval of an application for a notice of clearing or the commencement of activities. Any improvements within 330 feet must be conducted with a bald eagle management plan consistent with the FWC Bald Eagle Management Plan and designed to protect the habitat. Any proposal for improvements within 330 feet must indicate that the crop planting or harvesting will not occur during nesting season to avoid impacts to the bald eagle habitat. 
(c)  Exotic vegetation removal. All persons intending to remove exotic vegetation, even if required to do so by city ordinance, on property where an active or alternate nest is within 660 feet must consult with city environmental sciences staff prior to vegetation removal. Appropriate conditions may be placed on the exotic removal notice. 
(d)  All other development. 
(1)  All persons contemplating the development of property to which this article is applicable are to consult with the environmental sciences division as early in the planning and design process as possible to ensure enhancement or protection of critical eagle nesting habitat within the buffer area. No construction (structures or site work) may occur within 660 feet during the nesting season, unless otherwise modified in an approved bald eagle management plan, in accordance with the National Guidelines and this article. 
(2)  Property owners and/or developers are required to prepare a management plan that protects critical eagle nesting habitat. However, no new bald eagle management plan will be required for projects in which a bald eagle management plan was submitted to and accepted by the city to support a building permit, local development order, development of regional impact, or zoning application approval. A new or amended bald eagle management plan will be required if subsequent development or a change in use is proposed that is inconsistent with the previously reviewed bald eagle management plan, or if a new or revised bald eagle management plan is required by condition or stipulation of the existing authorization. 
a.  Prior to consideration and approval by resolution of the city council, all eagle management plans must be submitted and will be reviewed by environmental sciences staff. 
b.  The director of community development or designee must recommend approval, denial, or approval of the proposed eagle management plan with conditions, or continue consideration of the proposed eagle management plan to seek technical advice from outside sources or to meet further with the applicant to revise or modify the proposed eagle management plan. 
c.  Staff will present the proposed bald eagle management plan to the city council, along with the written staff opinion and any recommendation from outside sources, if any. This may include any advisory board set up by resolution of city council to assist with monitoring nests and eagle activity. 
(3)  All development within critical eagle nesting habitat and buffer areas must be consistent with the approved management plan. 
(4)  Management plans to protect or enhance critical eagle nesting habitat must include the following items, where applicable: 
a.  Description of the landscape within and surrounding the critical eagle nesting habitat, including FLUCCFS map, locations and height of active and alternate nest trees and perch trees, tree survey, and a description of the location, height, species and density of understory and canopy vegetation, as related to visibility between the active nest and proposed development. 
b.  History and behavior patterns of the eagle pair. 
c.  A one inch equals 200 feet aerial map and a map at the scale of the development that shows the location of the eagle's nest, flight path to and from the nest, location and size of visual obstacles, such as trees, between the nest and proposed development, nearest known foraging area for the eagle, location and type of existing and permitted developments within 1,500 feet of the nest, and other critical eagle nesting habitat features, as well as the proposed development. 
d.  The boundaries, size, and shape of the proposed buffer area. 
e.  Conservation measures designed to minimize potential adverse impacts of the development on nesting bald eagles that may result in disturbance or abandonment of the nest. Such conservation measures include, but are not limited to, compliance with the management plan and compliance with national or state guidelines, establishment of a planted landscape buffer, construction phasing indicating timing and location of construction activities during nesting and non-nesting periods (i.e., no construction within 330 feet of a nest during nesting season), height limits on buildings within the buffer area, protection of the flight path and the nesting tree, monitoring of eagles and nests using the federal monitoring guidelines, conservation easement, and other necessary measures to protect or enhance critical eagle nesting habitat. 
f.  Techniques to maintain viable nesting habitat. These techniques may include controlled burning, planting, or removal of vegetation, invasive exotic species control, maintaining hydrologic regimes, and monitoring. 
g.  Deed restrictions, protective covenants, easements, or other legal mechanisms running with the land that provide reasonable assurances that the approved management plan will be implemented and followed by all subsequent owners of the property in question. 
h.  A commitment to educate future owners, tenants, or other users of the development about the specific requirements of the approved eagle management plan and the state and federal eagle protection laws. 
(5)  The legal effect of management plans will be limited geographically to property owned or controlled by the proponent of the plan. 
(6)  In determining whether the proposed project and conservation measures protect or enhance eagle habitat in accordance with this article and the Bonita Plan, environmental sciences staff will consider the intensity of the proposed and existing development, quality of habitat, behavior of the specific nesting eagles, extent of measures proposed in the eagle management plan, and the consistency with the guidelines promulgated by FWC and the USFWS in the review of management plans and may request technical assistance from the FWC or the USFWS whenever necessary. This review will be the basis of staff recommendation to the city council. 
(7)  An approved management plan will remain effective, notwithstanding the abandonment of a nest, unless the abandonment occurs prior to the use of any incentives (see section 7-80) and the property owner relinquishes the incentives by amending the development order or taking other appropriate action. 
(Ord. No. 10-05, § 1(7-119), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 7-80. - Compensation incentives for protection of critical eagle nesting habitat. 
    If the city council elects not to acquire a critical eagle nesting habitat, then the city may permit all or some of the following special compensation benefits as incentives to the developer or property owner for the purpose of protecting critical eagle nesting habitat in exchange for the property owner's agreement to institute mechanisms for protection or enhancement of critical eagle nesting habitat on the property: 
(1)  For a buffer area of 330 feet in radius or an approximate equivalent acreage, minimum, the following benefits will be granted: 
a.  The property owner will be allowed to transfer density from within the buffer area to designated upland areas within the subject property at the same density permitted for the property as determined through the residential planned development process. For a buffer area, or portion thereof, composed of wetlands, an internal transfer of one development right per five acres will apply. 
b.  The property owner will be allowed priority review and processing of zoning and development applications for the subject property and, if applicable, one other parcel under unified control. 
(2)  For a buffer area of 660 feet in radius or an approximate equivalent acreage, the following benefits, in addition to those set forth in subsection (1) of this section, may be granted: 
a.  The city will establish an account to pay community development the zoning application fee on the subject property; 
b.  The city will establish an account to pay community development building permit application fees on the subject property; 
c.  The city will establish an account to pay community development review-related fees on the subject property; and 
d.  The eagle preserve will be available to offset any indigenous preserve or open space requirement at a ratio of 1.5:1 (1.5 acre of indigenous preserve or open space area is offset by each acre of eagle preserve); provided, however, that such incentive has not already been applied in accordance with section 3-417(b)(3) or 3-456(e). 
(3)  For a buffer area of 750 feet in radius, or an approximate equivalent acreage, the following benefits, in addition to those set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, will be granted: The city will provide a credit against regional park impact fees on the subject property, and if applicable, one other parcel under unified control located within the same regional park impact fee district. In no event will the credit towards regional park impact fee exceed the appraised value of the dedicated land. 
(4)  In order to receive the benefits mentioned in this section, the buffer areas must be designated as critical eagle nesting habitat and must be conveyed to the city by either warranty deed or by dedication of a perpetual conservation easement. 
(5)  In no event will the amount of fees waived or credited set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of this section exceed twice the appraised value of the buffer area conveyed to the county. The appraised value will be based on two current documented appraisals of the fair market value or sales price of the land. Appraisals must be prepared by qualified appraisers and are subject to approval by the city manager. 
(6)  City council may by resolution establish an advisory board to provide input on any incentive plan.

(County Ord. No. 95-01, § 1(14-215), 1-4-1995) 
Sec. 7-157. - Criteria for establishing protection zones. 
(a)  The protection zone maps have been developed based on steady state groundwater flow and transient contaminant transport to wells or wellfields regulated by this article that considers all, but not exclusively, the following factors: 
(1)  Mathematical solution considers three-dimensional flow of a homogeneous, incompressible fluid through a nonhomogeneous, anisotropic aquifer. 
(2)  Confined and unconfined aquifer flow conditions are applied as appropriate in layered aquifers calibrated to the city's hydrogeologic conditions for steady state, regional flow. 
(3)  Area-specific values of hydrogeologic parameters, including both horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity, are used. 
(4)  Aquifer-specific values of contaminant transport parameters, including longitudinal and transverse dispersivity coefficients, and effective porosity are used. 
(5)  Recharge from rainfall is assigned to be zero to establish conservative calculations of the protection zones. 
(6)  Conservative contaminants that do not decay and do not absorb to the porous medium are assumed. 
(7)  Wellfield locations, and well locations within wellfields, are specified. 
(8)  Wellfield pumping rates are assigned as the greater of the average annual rate permitted the South Florida Water Management District or the maximum historical average annual rate, but not more than the present estimated capacity. 
(9)  Pumpage is distributed among individual wells in a wellfield by prorating total pumpage based on the present estimated capacity of each well. 
(10)  Identification of travel time contours is determined by determining distances where contamination would have been six months, one year, five years and ten years in the past if theoretical contamination appeared in wells at the present. The travel time zones incorporate the influence of both the wellfield zone of influence due to pumping and the regional groundwater flow gradient. 
(b)  The protection zones indicated on the protection zone maps are the planar geometric union of the largest of the travel time protection zones determined as follows: 
(1)  Water table (surficial) aquifer system. 
a.  Water table, six-month. The land situated between an existing public water supply well and the six-month travel time contour. 
b.  Water table, one-year. The land area situated between the well and the one-year travel time contour. 
c.  Water table, five-year. The land area situated between the well and the five-year travel time contour. 
d.  Water table, ten-year. The land area situated between the well and the ten-year travel time contour. 
(2)  Lower Tamiami (surficial) aquifer system. 
a.  Lower Tamiami, one-year. The land area situated between an existing public water supply well and the one-year travel time contour. 
b.  Lower Tamiami, five-year. The land area situated between the well and the five-year travel time contour. 
c.  Lower Tamiami, ten-year. The land area situated between the well and the ten-year travel time contour. 
(3)  Sandstone (intermediate) aquifer system. 
a.  Sandstone, one-year. The land area situated between an existing public water supply well and the one-year travel time contour. 
b.  Sandstone, five-year. The land area situated between the well and the five-year travel time contour. 
c.  Sandstone, ten-year. The land area situated between the well and the ten-year travel time contour. 
(4)  Mid-Hawthorn (intermediate) aquifer system. Mid-Hawthorn, ten-year. The land situated between existing public water supply wells and the ten-year travel time contour. 
(c)  The aquifers referenced in this article are identical to those listed in the report titled "Final Report, Wellfield Protection Modeling, Lee County, Florida," Camp, Dresser and McKee, Inc., November 1987. 
(County Ord. No. 95-01, § 1(14-216), 1-4-1995) 
Sec. 7-158. - Best management practices for the construction industry. 
(a)  The general contractor, or, if none, the property owner, will be responsible for ensuring that each contractor or subcontractor evaluates each site before construction is initiated to determine if any site conditions may post particular problems for the handling of any regulated substances. For instance, handling regulated substances in the proximity of water bodies or wetlands may be improper. 
(b)  If any regulated substances are stored on the construction site during the construction process, they must be stored in a location and manner which will minimize any possible risk of release to the environment. Any storage containers of 55 gallons, or 440 pounds, or more containing regulated substances must have constructed below them an impervious containment system constructed of material of sufficient thickness, density and composition that will prevent the discharge to the land, groundwaters or surface waters of any pollutant which may emanate from the storage tanks. Each containment system must be able to contain 150 percent of the contents of all storage containers above the containment system. 
(c)  Each contractor will familiarize himself with the manufacturer's safety data sheet supplied with each material containing a regulated substance and will be familiar with procedures required to contain and clean up any releases of the regulated substance. Any tools or equipment necessary to accomplish such containment and cleanup must be available in case of a release. 
(d)  Upon completion of construction, all unused and waste-regulated substances and containment systems will be removed from the construction site by the responsible contractor and must be disposed of in a proper manner as prescribed by law.

    ERP means environmental resource permit. 
    FDEP means the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. 
    SFWMD means the South Florida Water Management District. 
    Wetlands, consistent with F.S. § 373.019(27), means those areas inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and a duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soils. Soils present in wetlands generally are classified as hydric or alluvial, or possess characteristics associated with reducing soil conditions The prevalent vegetation in wetlands generally consists of facultative or obligate hydrophytic macrophytes that are typically adapted to areas having soil conditions described above. These species, due to morphological, physiological, or reproductive adaptations, have the ability to grow, reproduce, or persist in aquatic environments or anaerobic soil conditions.

Sec. 7-227. - Findings of fact. 
    The city council hereby finds and determines that trees promote the health and general welfare of the citizens of the city; specifically: 
(1)  Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and assist in purifying the air; 
(2)  Trees precipitate dust and other particulate airborne pollutants from the air; 
(3)  Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the soil and play an important and effective part in city-wide soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control; 
(4)  Trees are an invaluable amenity to the city, providing shade, cooling the air and land, and reducing noise levels and glare; 
(5)  The protection of trees within the city is not only desirable, but essential to the health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens, present and future, of the city; and 
(6)  Some trees are more beneficial than others as necessary contributions to the city's environment, and it is not necessary to protect each and every tree in order to attain the publicly beneficial result of a tree protection ordinance.

(County Ord. No. 94-14, § 18, 5-18-1994; County Ord. No. 99-05, § 5(14-375), 6-29-1999) 
Sec. 7-243. - Restoration standards. 
(a)  If a violation of this article has occurred and, upon agreement of the city manager and the violator, or if they cannot agree, then, upon conviction by the court or the code enforcement hearing examiner, a restoration plan shall be ordered. The restoration plan shall include the following minimum planting standards: 
(1)  Planting plan for all protected trees. Replacement stock shall be computed on a three-for-one basis according to the total number of unlawfully removed trees. The term "three for one" in this article refers to the requirement of replacing an illegally removed tree with three live trees according to the provisions of this article. Replacement trees shall be nursery-grown, containerized, and no less than six feet in height. It shall be within the discretion of the city manager to allow a deviation from the above specified ratio. When such deviation is sought, the total of heights and calipers shall equal or exceed that specified in the above standards. An example of this might be one in which trees four feet in height might be planted in a ratio of five replacement trees to one illegally removed tree. Justification for such a deviation shall be provided to the city manager. 
(2)  Planting plan for understory vegetation. Vegetation shall be restored to the area from which protected trees were unlawfully removed or mutilated. The plant selection shall be based on that characteristic of the Florida Land Use, Cover, and Classification System (FLUCCS) Code. Shrubs, ground cover, and grasses shall be restored as delineated in the FLUCCS Code. Up to seven species shall be utilized with relative proportions characteristic of those in the FLUCCS Code. The exact number and type of species required shall also be based upon the existing indigenous vegetation on adjacent property. Replacement stock shall be no less than one gallon-size, nursery-grown, containerized stock planted at no less than three feet on center in the area from which protected trees were unlawfully removed or mutilated. This area shall be defined by the drip line of the trees. The number of shrubs shall not exceed, but may be less than, 25 shrubs per tree unlawfully removed or mutilated. The understory of the restored site shall be protected for a period of no less than ten years, unless its removal is a provision of a development order which has been approved after the restoration of the site. 
(3)  If the unlawful removal or mutilation of trees has caused any change in hydrology or surface water flows, then the hydrology or surface water flows shall be restored to pre-violation condition. 
(b)  Massing of replacement stock shall be subject to agreement of the parties or, if appropriate, then by approval of the court or the code enforcement hearing examiner as long as the minimum number of trees and/or seedlings are provided. Replacement stock, with the exception of palms, shall be Florida Number 1 or better grade. Replacement stock shall have a guaranteed 80 percent survivability for a period of no less than five years. A maintenance provision of no less than five years must be provided in the restoration plan to control invasion of exotic vegetation. Replacement stock shall not be located on any property line, underground utility, or city easement. The city manager may at his discretion allow the replacement stock to be planted off site where approved development displaces areas to be restored. In these situations, off-site plantings shall be on lands under the control of a public agency. The off-site location is subject to the approval of the city manager. 
(c)  In the event of impending development on property wherein protected trees are unlawfully removed, the restoration plan shall indicate the location of the replacement stock consistent with any approved plans for subsequent development. For the purposes of this article, impending development shall mean that a developer has made application for a preliminary development order or applied for a building permit. 
(d)  In the event that identification of the species of trees is impossible for any reason on property wherein protected trees were unlawfully removed, then a presumption is raised that the trees illegally removed were of a similar species and mix as those found on adjacent properties. 
(e)  A monitoring report shall be submitted to the city manager on an annual basis for five years describing the conditions of the restored site. The monitoring report shall be submitted on or before each anniversary date of the effective date of the restoration plan. Mortality estimates per species planted, estimated causes for mortality, growth of the vegetation, and other factors which would indicate the functional health of the restored systems shall be included in the monitoring report. Failure to submit the report in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of this article. When mitigation is required pursuant to this article, monitoring reports are necessary to ensure that the mitigation efforts have been successful. In order to verify the success of the mitigation efforts and the accuracy of the monitoring reports, periodic inspections by city staff are necessary. In order that the city be compensated by the violator for the costs of these periodic inspections of the restored site by city staff, a schedule of inspection fees shall be established by the city council and on file in the city clerk's office. 
(f)  In the event that a violation of section 7-237 occurs, then the restoration provisions contained within section 7-237 shall govern and supersede any other restoration provisions contained within this article.

It shall be within the discretion of the city manager to allow a deviation from the above specified ratio. When such deviation is sought, the total of height and diameter shall equal or exceed those specified in this subsection. 
(2)  Mangrove alteration violations due to filling, excavation, drainage and/or clearing shall be restored to natural ground elevation and soil conditions prior to commencement of replanting. 
(3)  Replacement stock shall not be located on any property line, underground utility, or county easement. 
(4)  In the event that the species of mangrove cannot be identified on property wherein mangroves were altered in violation of this article, then a presumption shall be made that the mangroves illegally altered were of a similar species and distribution as those found on adjacent properties. 
(5)  Replacement plantings shall have a minimum of 80 percent survival at the end of five years; however, success will be evaluated on an annual basis. 
(6)  The restoration plan shall include a maintenance provision of no less than five years for the control of invasive exotic vegetation. 
(7)  Within 90 days of completion of the restoration, a written report shall be submitted to the city.

Sec. 7-296. - Industrial activity. 
(a)  Industrial activity classification. For purposes of this article, all industrial activity falls into one of two major categories: 
(1)  Construction-related activity. This includes sites of new development or significant redevelopment falling within the industrial activity categories listed as subsections (9) and (10) in the definition of the term "industrial site" in section 7-295. 
(2)  On-going industrial activity. This includes sites that encompass uses or activities that are identified in industrial activity categories listed as subsections (1) through (8) and (11) in the definition of the term "industrial site" in section 7-295. 
(b)  Construction site runoff. Compliance with this subsection applies to all construction associated with an industrial activity category, identified in section 7-295, that is not complete prior to July 1, 2003. Projects under construction on July 1, 2003, or beginning construction thereafter, must comply with the requirements set forth in this section. All development approvals for development of more than one acre, including development orders and building permits, must address stormwater quality issues, including construction runoff, as follows: 
(1)  Submit an SWP3 for construction meeting the criteria set forth in section 7-297, prior to development order approval. If a development order is not required, then the SWP3 must be submitted prior to the building or vegetation removal permit issuance. At the discretion of the code enforcement manager, an affidavit or certification from a state-licensed professional engineer may be submitted, prior to start of construction activity, attesting that the SWP3 for construction has been prepared in accordance with section 7-297 and will be on site and available for review during all phases of construction; 
(2)  Maintain a copy of the SWP3 on site at all times for review by the city; and 
(3)  File a notice of intent (NOI) with the state department of environmental protection (FDEP), in accordance with the direction of DEP Document No. 62-621 and with public works at least 48 hours prior to the start of construction. 
(c)  Industrial site runoff. 
(1)  Applicability. This subsection applies to existing or ongoing industrial activity which encompasses industrial activity occurring on a site subsequent to completion of the initial site construction. 
(2)  Industrial activity beginning prior to July 1, 1998. 
a.  All industrial activity sites operating or functioning prior to July 1, 1998, with respect to the proposed and approved end use, that are required to hold a NPDES permit, individual or group, in order to meet federal regulations, must provide the city with a copy of the permit, the permit application or the NOI no later than October 1, 2002. If the property owner complies with this subsection by providing the city with a copy of the permit application or NOI, then the property owner must provide the city with a copy of the permit upon receipt from the EPA. 
b.  No industrial activity that is in compliance with the NPDES requirements as of October 1, 1997 (County MS4 permit issuance date) will be required by the county to retrofit its stormwater system, unless changes identified in this article are made to the site or the MS4 is deemed in violation of state water quality standards. If a water quality violation is discovered, the MS4 will be evaluated to determine the most effective method to bring the system into compliance The compliance effort may require improvements to an existing site. 
(3)  Industrial activity beginning after July 1, 1998. All sites proposing to engage in industrial activity categories, as set forth in section 7-295, that are required to hold a valid NPDES permit for either the discharge of stormwater or regulated industrial activity, other than stormwater discharge, must provide copies of the permit and SWP3 for site operation to the county natural resources division for review, upon receipt from the EPA. If a permit is required for both stormwater discharge and site activity, one permit encompassing both activities is sufficient. 
(4)  Site expansion.

2.  All other docks-No less than 25 feet. 
3.  Boat lifts and mooring pilings-No less than ten feet. 
c.  Side setback requirements can be reduced if: 
1.  Adjoining property owners execute a written agreement in recordable form, agreeing to a setback less than that required or to a zero setback; and 
2.  Placement of the dock in accordance with the setback agreement will not result in greater environmental impacts than compliance with the regulations set forth in this subsection (4). 
d.  The director, in his discretion, may permit administrative deviations from the setbacks required by this subsection (4) if the facility is located as close to the required setback as possible and: 
1.  The width of the subject parcel is not wide enough to permit construction of a docking facility, perpendicular to the shoreline at the midpoint of the shoreline property line, without a deviation; or 
2.  Construction of the structure outside the setback area will not cause or will minimize damage to wetland vegetation or other environmental resources or will not cause greater damage than will occur if the deviation is not granted. 
The director's decision under this subsection can be appealed through the procedure set forth in section 4-124(1) or the applicant may seek a variance in accordance with section 7-359. 
e.  All boat ramps must be set back ten feet from all adjoining side lot and side riparian lines. 
(5)  Location.
