PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances of the City of Mobile of a general and permanent nature. It is the first such publication in more than twenty years. As expressed in Chapter 1, the Code supersedes all such conflicting ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the recodification were the 1965 Mobile Code, as supplemented through 1971, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Anticipating growth, several chapters have been reserved for potential new chapters. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the ninth section of chapter 2 is 2-9. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-2 and 4-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-2.1, 4-2.2, 4-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of each chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout both the recodification and the republication projects. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Glenda Morgan, Assistant City Clerk, and Connie Morrow-Fundin, Assistant City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on the republication project. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-33. - Procedure for issuance and disposition of charge. 
(a)  When any officer, inspector, investigator, auditor or other employee of the city, designated by the City Code, ordinance or appointment by the mayor, as an enforcement officer finds any violation or violations of any provision of any municipal law which he is authorized and required to enforce, the city employee may issue, on forms provided by the city, a municipal offense ticket and deliver it to the person in violation of such municipal law. The municipal offense ticket shall direct the person to appear in the municipal court of the city at a time and on a date stated therein to answer to the charge or charges for violating such municipal law, which shall be stated in the municipal offense ticket. However, in the alternative, if the violation is the first violation of such municipal law by the person cited, such person, in lieu of appearing in municipal court, pursuant to the municipal offense ticket, may pay the appropriate fine pursuant to terms stated in section 1-32 and on the municipal offense ticket, in addition to either of the following: 
(1)  Appearing in person before a magistrate, signing the plea of guilty and waiver of trial provision on the ticket or on a form provided by the magistrate and paying the fine and costs, provided that the magistrate retains a copy of the ticket or such other form; or 
(2)  Signing the guilty plea and waiver of trial provisions on the ticket and mailing the ticket and the amount of the fine and costs to the clerk of the court. Remittance by mail of the fine and costs constitutes a guilty plea and waiver of trial, whether or not the guilty plea and waiver of trial provision on the ticket are signed by the defendant. Should the amount tendered be insufficient, such money received by the magistrate or clerk shall be considered to be a partial payment of the lawful penalty, applied by the clerk to the fines and costs, and disbursed as required by law. The clerk may give notice of such insufficiency, and a supplemental summons or warrant of arrest shall be issued for the offender's arrest, and a judgment shall be entered by the magistrate of court for the balance of the penalty due. 
(b)  If any person so cited shall fail to appear in the municipal court of the city at the time and place stated in any municipal offense ticket duly issued or to pay the appropriate fine set forth on the municipal offense ticket, as set forth herein, the officer, inspector, investigator, auditor or other employee of the city issuing such citation is hereby authorized and directed to swear out a warrant or execute an affidavit or complaint charging such person with a violation of the municipal law, or laws, listed on such municipal offense ticket. 
(c)  The officers, inspectors, investigators, auditors or other employees of the city, designated by municipal law as enforcement officers and authorized to issue municipal offense tickets as herein provided, are hereby further authorized to swear out warrants or execute affidavits or complaints charging such person or persons with any violation of municipal law, without first having issued a municipal offense ticket for such violation. 
(Ord. No. 41-044, § 3, 6-26-90) 
Sec. 1-34. - Penalty for second offense, failure to appear, etc. 
    Any person receiving a second municipal offense ticket for a violation of a municipal law or laws, and anyone failing to appear in municipal court, or otherwise to settle the matter prior to the date stated on the municipal offense ticket, pursuant to the provisions of this division, shall be punished as prescribed in chapter 1, article II, City Code (1991), or by community service for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment as prescribed in chapter 1, article II, City Code (1991), and/or community service at the discretion of the judge, unless otherwise prohibited by state law.

Sec. 1-35. - Uniform nontraffic citation and complaint.

The procedures for pleading guilty to nontraffic offenses charged by a UNTCC as established by rule 20 of the Alabama Rules of Judicial Administration, and all other provisions of said rule, as currently enacted or as hereafter amended, shall apply.

(6)  If a resolution or ordinance is on the agenda under the caption "PUBLIC HEARINGS," the public must be given an opportunity to be heard and express its opinion. Such expression from the public shall be prior to any motion relative to the resolution or ordinance.

( Ord. No. 17-025-2014, 7-8-14 ) 
Sec. 17-8. - Applications for tier 1 and tier 2 land disturbance permits. 
(a)  General rule. A land disturbance permit is required for all land-disturbing activities, including any land change which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediment to the municipal separate storm sewer system ("MS4"), including, but not limited to, the clearing, dredging, excavating, transporting and filling of land, except as detailed in subsection (b). 
(b)  When a land disturbance permit is not required. A land disturbance permit shall not be required for the following, provided however, that a right-of-way and other permits may be required: 
(1)  Agriculture. 
(2)  Silviculture, except to the extent that a timber harvesting permit is required. 
(3)  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens, landscaping on individual residential lots (excluding landscaping performed by, or on behalf of, a developer or builder, who builds a house greater than four thousand (4,000) square feet), home repairs, home maintenance work, minor additions to houses, the construction, maintenance or repair of accessory structures and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion. Minor land-disturbing activities include only excavations of less than four thousand (4,000) square feet which are less than two (2) feet in depth, or which does not create a cut slope greater than five (5) feet in height nor steeper than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical. Cumulative impervious surfaces greater than four thousand (4,000) square feet (considering development and improvements completed after 1984) require a land disturbance permit, even if the current disturbance is less than four thousand (4,000) square feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if warranted by the circumstances, the city engineer may in his sole discretion impose a CBMP plan and require a land disturbance permit even though an excavation is less than four thousand (4,000) square feet. 
(4)  Minor land-disturbing activities such as individual connections for utility services and sewer services for single- or two-family residences, minor grading for driveways, yard areas and sidewalks, excluding any grading done by, or on behalf of, a developer or builder in connection with the construction of a house. However, right of way and other permits may be required. 
(5)  The construction, repair or rebuilding of railroad tracks, excluding privately owned rail spurs. 
(6)  Minor subsurface exploratory excavations under the direction of engineers or geologists licensed in the state. 
(7)  The opening of individual burial sites in property which has been approved for such use by all necessary governmental authorities. 
(8)  Installation of water supply wells or environmental ground water monitoring wells. 
(9)  A fill which is less than one (1) foot in depth and placed on a natural ground surface with a slope flatter than five (5) horizontal to one (1) vertical; or does not exceed fifty (50) cubic yards on any one (1) lot; and is less than three (3) feet in depth; is not intended to support structures; and does not obstruct a drainage course. This exemption does not apply in special flood hazard areas, which require a tier 2 permit. 
(10)  Emergency utility repairs. 
(11)  Single family residences separately built where the residence, including driveways and all impervious surface constructed post-1984 on-site, does not increase the impervious surface area more than four thousand (4,000) square feet of land surface area. However, the builder will be required to install silt barriers and use best management practices as necessary to prevent erosion of dirt, rock debris, and building materials onto public or private property and into the city's MS4 and comply with all city ordinances. 
The activities referred to in subsections (1) through (11) above may be undertaken without a land disturbance permit; however, the persons conducting such activities must do so in accordance with the provisions of this division and any other applicable law, including the proper control of sedimentation and runoff to the MS4. This division shall apply to any land-disturbing activities that drain to the MS4 if a stormwater pollution problem is shown to be caused by such activity following monitoring procedures and complaints.

(6)  Whenever the city engineer determines that a CBMP plan does not comply with this division, he shall notify the applicant in writing of the ways in which the CBMP plan does not comply with this division. 
(7)  To the maximum extent practicable, sediment in runoff water must be minimized by using appropriate BMPs. 
(8)  Structural controls shall be designed by a registered Alabama professional engineer. Structural controls shall be designed and maintained as required to minimize erosion and pollution to the maximum extent practicable. All surface water flowing toward the construction area shall, to the maximum extent practicable, either be passed through the site in a protected channel or diverted by using berms, channels or sediment traps, as necessary. Erosion and sediment control measures shall be designed, according to the size and slope of the disturbed areas or drainage areas, to minimize erosion and to control sediment, to the maximum extent practicable. Discharges from sediment basins and traps must be conducted in a manner consistent with good engineering practices. Sediment-laden, or otherwise polluted, water discharged to the MS4 must be addressed in a manner consistent with good engineering practices and the requirements of this division. 
(9)  Control measures shall be maintained as an effective barrier to sedimentation and erosion in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(10)  There shall be no distinctly visible floating scum, oil or other matter contained in the stormwater discharge. The stormwater discharge to an MS4 must not cause an unnatural color (except dyes or other substances discharged to an MS4 for the purpose of environmental studies and which do not have harmful effect on the bodies of water within the MS4) or odor in the community waters. The stormwater discharge to the MS4 must result in no materials in concentrations sufficient to be hazardous or otherwise detrimental to humans, livestock, wildlife, plant life or fish and aquatic life in the community waters. 
(11)  When the land-disturbing activity is finished and stable vegetation or other permanent controls have been established on all remaining exposed soil, the owner of the land where the land-disturbing activity was conducted, or his authorized agent, shall notify the city of these facts, and request a final inspection. The city shall then inspect the site within five (5) working days after receipt of the engineer's as-built certification, see section 17-7(o), and may require additional measures to stabilize the soil and control erosion and sedimentation. If additional measures are required by the city, written notice of such additional measures shall be delivered to the owner, and the owner shall continue to be covered by the land disturbance permit issued with respect to the land-disturbing activity until a final and complete inspection is made to the satisfaction of the city. The owner's professional engineer shall certify to the city that land-disturbing activity is finished and stable, and vegetation or other permanent controls have been established on all remaining exposed soil for the site. Following receipt of an acceptable final engineer's as-built certification of the project and satisfactory inspection, the city will deliver to the owner, within ten (10) days of the date of such certification, a sign-off will be entered in the permitting system showing that the erosion control requirements of the land disturbance permit have been fulfilled. At that time, the site and/or the project constructed thereon may come under the operation of other ordinances of the city. 
(12)  The CBMP plan must be accompanied by a letter of credit, a surety bond or a cash bond, with the city having the right to determine which type of security shall be furnished.

b.  Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan approved by the city engineer and implemented pursuant to this division. 
c.  Provisions are made to manage stormwater through an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designated and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice. 
d.  The city engineer finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of the site. 
e.  Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce: 
1.  The generation of stormwater from the site; and 
2.  The size and cost of stormwater storage; and the pollutants generated at the site. 
f.  The city will not grant a waiver if to do so would cause any of the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
1.  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, or other structures, or any element of the city's MS4, private water courses, waters of the state or of the United States; 
2.  Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
3.  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; 
4.  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property. 
g.  In order to be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must complete a mitigation measure, which may include but is not limited to one (1) of the following: 
1.  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. The donation shall run with the land, and shall be recorded in the records of the Office of the Probate Court, Mobile County. 
2.  The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this division. 
3.  Payment of a fee in lieu of stormwater practices may be accepted when implementation of otherwise applicable stormwater practices is impracticable under the provisions of this subsection. The fee will be determined according to a fee schedule established by the city based on the size and type of the development activity.

Sec. 17-10. - Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities-Post-construction stormwater management in new development and redevelopment. 
(a)  Maintenance easement-Tier 1 developments. Prior to the issuance of a tier 1 permit, the owner of the site must agree to a maintenance easement that runs with the land and provides the city all authority required to monitor and enforce BMPs. If the land is to be subdivided, the maintenance easement shall be identified on the subdivision plat recorded in the records of the probate judge for the county. The easement shall provide for access to the property at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this division. Any stormwater easement agreement that does not appear on a subdivision plat shall be recorded in the records of the probate judge for the county. 
(b)  Maintenance covenants-Tier 1 developments. Maintenance of all stormwater management BMPs shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the city and recorded in the records of the probate judge for the county, prior to final plan approval. The covenant shall include a schedule for routine maintenance checks, and periodic inspections in a frequency sufficient to assure the proper performance of the BMPs. Maintenance and inspection shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
In the event the stormwater BMPs fail to perform effectively, the parties may amend the maintenance covenants by written amendment recorded in the records of the probate judge for the county. 
(c)  Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management BMPs shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least five (5) years. Inspections shall be completed by a QCI or QCP. These records shall be submitted to the city engineer annually on January 1 or such other date designated by the city engineer. In the event the responsible party fails to provide the annual records, city officials may conduct an inspection of the property. The fee for said inspection shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00) or the actual cost of inspection, whichever is greater. 
(d)  Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to restore or repair the BMPs. In the event that the stormwater run-off becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the BMPs in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have fifteen (15) days to correct the deficiency in an approved manner depending upon the severity and nature of the violation. After proper notice, the city may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be collected as a municipal lien in accordance with the procedures applicable to the abatement of public nuisances. 
(e)  Unauthorized discharge prohibited and declared a public nuisance. 
(1)  Unauthorized discharges prohibited. Any discharge of stormwater made in violation of this division or of any condition of a tier 1 land disturbance permit issued or maintenance covenant, see section 17-10(b), entered pursuant to this division is prohibited and is hereby declared a public nuisance subject to correction and/or abatement in accordance with applicable law. 
(2)  Exceptions. Discharges from the following activities will not be considered a source of pollutants to the MS4 and to waters of the United States and waters of the state when properly managed to ensure that no potential pollutants are present: 
a.  Discharge from emergency fire-fighting activities; 
b.  Water used to control dust, as long as no runoff is generated; 
c.  Potable water including uncontaminated water line flushing not associated with hydrostatic testing;

e.  Pavement wash waters where spills or leaks of toxic or hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spill material has been removed) and where detergents are not used; 
f.  Uncontaminated air conditioning or compressor condensate associated with temporary office trailers and other similar buildings; 
g.  Uncontaminated ground water or spring water; 
h.  Foundation or footing drains where flows are not contaminated with process materials such as solvents. 
(3)  Except for emergency discharges noted above, allowable discharges shall not allow sediment to wash off-site and into the MS4 and waters of the United States. 
(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver or order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the ADEM or EPA, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver or order and other applicable laws and regulations. 
(f)  Accidental discharges. 
(1)  Release of hazardous materials. In the event of any discharge of a hazardous substance or a significant spill of a hazardous substance to the MS4 which could constitute a threat to human health or the environment, the premises owner or operator of the premises shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services (911) and shall also notify the city 311 operator by phone or e-mail as soon as possible but not later than twenty-four (24) hours from the date and time of the release as to the occurrence of and the quantity of the release. 
(2)  Release of non-hazardous materials. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials to the MS4, said person shall notify the fire department and the city 311 operator by phone or e-mail as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four (24) hours from the date and time of the release as to the occurrence of and the quantity of the release. 
(3)  The owner or operator of property on which a release identified in paragraph (1) or (2) above occurs, shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such spill so as to minimize any adverse impact to the waters of the state and waters of the United States caused by discharges to the MS4, including such improved or additional monitoring as may be necessary to determine the nature and impact of the discharge. Absent a compelling public interest to the contrary, it shall not be a defense for the owner or operator in an enforcement action that it would have necessary to halt or reduce the business or activity of the site, or any project or facility thereon, to maintain water quality and minimize any adverse impact that the discharge may cause. 
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city engineer within three (3) business days of date of the phone or in person notice. 
(4)  Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of this division. 
(g)  Immediate threats to public health, welfare or the environment. Notwithstanding any other provision in this division to the contrary, in the event of an immediate threat to the public health or welfare, the city may take all appropriate measures to remove or alleviate such threat.

DIVISION 2. - FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS 

Sec. 17-17. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 65-007-2009, 3-10-09) 
Sec. 17-18. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazard to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 65-007-2009, 3-10-09)

(1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or 
(2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alternation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a flood plain management regulation.

Sec. 17-21. - Lands to which this division applies. 
    This division shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city and other areas designated by the city engineer as potential flood hazard areas. 
(Ord. No. 65-007-2009, 3-10-09) 
Sec. 17-22. - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study of the city, dated July 6, 1998, with accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this division. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for the county are hereby adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas know to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in an FIS. 
(Ord. No. 65-007-2009, 3-10-09) 
Sec. 17-23. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any other administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 65-007-2009, 3-10-09) 
Sec. 17-24. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The city engineer shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variances from the requirements of this division. The city engineer will review and issue comments within fourteen (14) days from receipt of a written request. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(c)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this division are met, no reasonable alternative exists and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(d)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(e)  In reviewing such requests, the city engineer shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors and all standards specified in this and other sections of this division. 
(f)  Conditions for variances: A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(1)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(g)  The provisions of this division are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(h)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(i)  The city shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal and state emergency management agencies upon request. 
(j)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city engineer may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this division. 
(k)  The director of public services shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision or determination is made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this division. 
(l)  Appeal procedure: The director of public services may grant a special exception to the requirements of this division if a permittee demonstrates with written evidence that: 
(1)  The exception will not create any threat to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(2)  The permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively prohibits the ability of the permittee to receive utility services in the city. 
(3)  The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person. 
(m)  Should any person be aggrieved by the decision of the director of public services, such person may appeal by filing written notice with the engineering department within fifteen (15) days from the date of such decision. The engineering department shall send a copy of the appeal and all relevant documentation, within fifteen (15) days, to the city clerk's office to be considered by the city council at a public hearing.

Sec. 17-35. - Scope. 
(a)  The purpose of the stormwater management provisions is to provide for effective management and financing of a stormwater system within the city, to provide a mechanism for mitigating the damaging effects of uncontrolled and unplanned stormwater runoff, to improve the public health, safety and welfare by providing for the safe and efficient capture and conveyance of stormwater runoff and the correction of stormwater problems, to authorize the establishment and implementation of a master plan for storm drainage including operation, maintenance, inspection and enforcement, to establish reasonable storm drainage service charges based on each property's contribution of stormwater runoff to the system and use and benefit of services and facilities and to encourage and facilitate urban water resources management techniques including detention of stormwater runoff, minimization of the need to construct storm sewers, and the enhancement of the environment. 
(b)  In order to accomplish such purpose a storm drainage service charge shall be made on each lot or parcel in the city. Each property's contribution to runoff shall be the primary consideration in establishing the service charge. Secondary consideration shall be given to specific service requirements of some properties, and special and general benefits accruing to or from properties as a result of providing their own stormwater management facilities. 
(c)  The storm drainage service charges shall bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing service and facilities. Similar properties shall pay similar stormwater service charges and such charges shall reflect the area of each property and its intensity of development, as these factors bear directly on the peak rate of stormwater runoff. 
(d)  An appeal shall be employed to review stormwater charges when circumstances exist which alter runoff characteristics or when either service or benefit varies from a normal condition or is of greater significance than contribution to runoff.

ARTICLE III. - BUSINESS LICENSE CODE AND SCHEDULE OF LICENSES 

Sec. 34-41. - Levy of tax. 
    Pursuant to the Code of Alabama, the following is hereby declared to be and is adopted as the business license code and schedule of licenses for the city for the year beginning January 1, 2008, and for each subsequent year thereafter. There is hereby levied and assessed a business license fee for the privilege of doing any kind of business, trade, profession or other activity in the city or the police jurisdiction, by whatever name called. 
(Ord. No. 34-077, § 1, 12-9-97; Ord. No. 34-084, § 1, 12-15-98; Ord. No. 34-058-2007, 11-27-07) 
Sec. 34-42. - Rate. 
(a)  Corporate limits. Each and every person, wherever located, who engages in any business within the corporate limits, shall pay an annual license according to the attached schedule of licenses, which is located at the end of this chapter. 
(b)  Police jurisdiction. Each and every person, wherever located, who engages in any business outside the corporate limits but within the police jurisdiction, shall pay an annual license at one-half (1/2) the rate according to the attached schedule of licenses. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit any person conducting business within the corporate limits to pay the half rate; this section applies only to persons who do not engage in any business within the corporate limits. 
(c)  Calculation method. Unless another method is specified in the schedule, each license shall be calculated by multiplying the licensee's gross receipts for the prior year by the scheduled rate, using the following regression table which shows the percent of the license rate to be applied to gross receipts: 
100 percent, to first million dollars or portion thereof. 
80 percent, to second million dollars or portion thereof. 
60 percent, to third million dollars or portion thereof. 
40 percent, to fourth million dollars or portion thereof. 
20 percent, to all amounts in excess of four million dollars. 
The above regression table shall apply only to those license fees calculated by the formula set out herein and not to any other license fees collected pursuant to this article III. 
(d)  Special rules for new businesses. 
(1)  Any person applying for a new license shall, upon payment of the minimum license amount in section 34-44, be issued a temporary license for a period of sixty (60) days. 
(2)  The short year: The year in which a business opens shall be referred to as the "short year." Not later than seventy (70) days after the issue date of the temporary license, the licensee shall file a sworn return showing the gross receipts during the first two (2) months of business. The licensee shall then pay such additional amounts as may be required by the applicable schedule for the said two (2) months; and multiplying that by six (6), applying thereto the same rate or sale of license fixed for those who did the same business during the preceding year. 
(3)  Year two: The year immediately following the short year shall be referred to as "year two." 
a.  If the amount calculated under (2) as the annualized gross receipts for the short year is less than the actual gross receipts for the short year, the annualized gross receipts for the purposes of calculating the amount due for a business license in year two will be deemed to be the actual gross receipts plus the amount of the underestimate of gross receipts for the short year. 
b.  If the amount calculated under (2) as the annualized gross receipts for the short year is more than the actual gross receipts for the short year, the annualized gross receipts for the purposes of calculating the amount due for a business license in year two will be deemed to be the actual gross receipts minus the amount of the overestimate of gross receipts for the short year. 
(4)  Failure to file the return required by this section shall constitute doing business without a license. 
(e)  Delivery license. 
(1)  In lieu of any other type of license, a taxpayer may at its option purchase for a payment in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) plus the issuance fee, a delivery license for the privilege of delivering its merchandise in the city if the taxpayer meets all of the following criteria: 
a.  Other than deliveries, the taxpayer has no physical presence within the city or its police jurisdiction; 
b.  The taxpayer conducts no business in the city other than delivering merchandise and performing the requested set-up and installation of said merchandise; 
c.  Such delivery and set-up and installation is performed by the taxpayer's employees or agents, concerns the taxpayer's own merchandise in the city, and is done by means of delivery vehicles owned, leased, or contracted by the taxpayer; 
d.  The gross receipts derived from the sale and any requisite set-up or installation of all merchandise so delivered shall not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) during the license year; 
e.  Any set-up or installation shall relate only to: 
1.  That required by the contract between the taxpayer and the customer or as may be required by state law; and 
2.  The merchandise so delivered; 
f.  If at any time during the current license year the taxpayer fails to meet any of the above stated criteria, then within ten (10) days after any of the said criteria have been violated or exceeded, the taxpayer shall purchase all appropriate business licenses from the city for the entire license year and without regard to this subsection. 
(2)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the city to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the seventy-five thousand dollar ($75,000.00) limitation described in the preceding subsection if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into the taxing jurisdiction using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. 
(3)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(4)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year. 
(5)  The purchase of a delivery license shall not, in and of itself, establish nexus between the taxpayer and the city for purposes of the taxes levied by or under the authority of title 40 of the Code of Alabama or other provisions of law, nor does the purchase of a delivery license conclusively determine that nexus does not exist between the taxpayer and the city. 
(f)  Branch office. 
(1)  A taxpayer subject to the license authorized by this ordinance that is engaged in business in other municipalities may account for its gross receipts so that the part of its gross receipts attributable to its branch offices will not be subject to the business license imposed by this ordinance. To establish a bona fide branch office, the taxpayer must demonstrate proof of all following criteria: 
a.  The taxpayer must demonstrate the continuing existence of an actual facility located outside the police jurisdiction in which its principal business office is located, such as a retail store, outlet, business office, showroom, or warehouse, to which employees and/or independent contractors are assigned or located during regular normal working hours. 
b.  The taxpayer must maintain books and records, which reasonably indicate a segregation or allocation of the taxpayer's gross receipts to the particular facility or facilities. 
c.  The taxpayer must provide proof that separate telephone listings, signs, and other indications of its separate activity are in existence. 
d.  Billing and/or collection activities relating to the business conducted at the branch office or offices are performed by an employee or other representative, of the taxpayer who has such responsibility for the branch office. 
e.  All business claimed by a branch office or offices must be conducted by and through said office or offices. 
f.  The taxpayer must supply proof that all applicable business licenses with respect to the branch office or offices have been issued. 
(2)  Nothing herein shall be construed as exempting businesses from payment of a license on the basis of a lack of physical location.

Sec. 34-44. - License term; minimums. 
(a)  Full year: Every person who commences business before the first day of July shall be subject to and shall pay the annual license for such business in full. Unless otherwise specified in the schedule, the minimum license shall be one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00). 
(b)  Half year: Every person who commences business on or after July 1, shall be subject to and shall pay one-half (1/2) of the annual license for such business for that calendar year. Persons commencing business on or after July 1 shall pay a minimum license of sixty dollars ($60.00).

Failure to furnish such statement or to pay such sum shall subject the company and its agents to those penalties as prescribed for doing business without a license as provided for in the municipal code. 
(3)  On or before December 31 of each year, a renewal reminder shall be mailed to each licensee that purchased a business license during the current year. Said renewal notice shall be mailed via regular U. S. mail to the licensee's last known address of record with the city. Licensees are required to furnish the city any address changes for their business prior to December 1 in order for them to receive their notice, and any delays attributable to licensees' failure to furnish address changes are attributable to the licensees, not to the city. The failure of the city to mail a renewal reminder shall not prevent the city from enforcing its business license laws against a taxpayer but shall preclude the city from assessing fines and penalties for late payment until a renewal reminder is mailed to the taxpayer at its last known address, as indicated in the city's records. 
(4)  Business license renewal payments received by the city shall be applied to the current renewal only when any and all other debts the licensee owes to the city are first paid in full.

(b)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt the gross receipts derived from one (1) or more additional lines of business of the taxpayer if those gross receipts do not exceed the required threshold for the purpose of a second or multiple business license. Instead, those gross receipts shall be included in the business license for the taxpayer's primary line of business.

Provided that a mere change in the name or ownership of a taxpayer that is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other form of legal entity now or hereafter recognized by the laws of the state shall not constitute a transfer for purposes of this chapter, unless: 
(1)  The change requires the taxpayer to obtain a new federal employer identification number or department of revenue taxpayer identification number; or 
(2)  The city subject license is one for the sale of alcoholic beverages.

Sec. 34-50. - Unlawful to do business without a license. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person, taxpayer, or agent of a person or taxpayer to engage in businesses or vocations in the city or its police jurisdiction for which a license is required without first having procured a license.

(b)  If the city determines that the amount of business license tax reported on or remitted with any business license remittance form is incorrect, if no business license remittance form is filed within the time prescribed, or if the information provided on the form is insufficient to allow the taxing jurisdiction to determine the proper amount of business license tax due, the city shall calculate the correct amount of the tax based on the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable and enter a preliminary assessment for the correct amount of business license tax, including any applicable penalty and interest. 
(c)  The city shall promptly mail a copy of any preliminary assessment to the taxpayer's last known address by either first class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested, or, in the sole discretion of the city, deliver the preliminary assessment to the taxpayer by personal delivery. 
(d)  If the amount of business license tax remitted by the taxpayer is undisputed by the city, or if the taxpayer consents to the amount of any deficiency or preliminary assessment in writing, the city shall enter a final assessment for the amount of the tax due, plus any applicable penalty and interest. 
(e)  (1)  If a taxpayer disagrees with a preliminary assessment as entered by the taxing jurisdiction, the taxpayer shall file a petition for review with the revenue director within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the preliminary assessment setting out the specific objections to the preliminary assessment.

(2)  If a petition for review is not timely filed, or is timely filed, and upon further review the revenue director determines that the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the city may make the assessment final in the amount of business license tax due as computed by the revenue director, with applicable interest and penalty computed to the date of entry of the final assessment. The revenue director shall, whenever practicable, complete his or her review of the taxpayer's petition for review and applicable law within ninety (90) days following the date of filing of the petition or the conference, if any. 
(3)  A copy of the final assessment shall promptly be mailed to the taxpayer's last known address (i) by either first class U. S. mail or certified U.

S. mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of business license tax of more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). In either case, at the option of the taxing jurisdiction a copy of the final assessment may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal delivery. The final assessment shall include a statement informing the taxpayer of his or her right to appeal the final assessment to circuit court within thirty (30) days from the date of the entry of the final assessment. On appeal to the circuit court, the final assessment shall be prima facie correct, and the burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to prove the assessment is incorrect.

(b)  The condition hereinabove set forth as grounds for the revocation or suspension of a license shall also constitute grounds for refusing to renew a license. 
(c)  The council shall set a time for hearing on the matter of revoking, suspending, or refusing to renew a license; and notice of such hearing shall be given to the licensee, or the applicant for renewal, as the case may be, at least ten (10) days before the day set for said hearing. At the hearing the council shall hear all evidence offered by any party and all evidence that may be presented bearing upon the question of revocation, suspension, or the refusal of renewal, as the case may be. 
(d)  (1)  Following the hearing contemplated by paragraph (c) of this section, the council may suspend the license for a period of no more than twelve (12) months, and may condition reinstatement upon the licensee's compliance with applicable state laws or regulations or city ordinances. A suspension not exceeding six (6) months may be imposed in cases where the licensee's violation is shown to be inadvertent and can be promptly corrected. 
(2)  No new license shall be issued to the licensee, or to any other firm in which the licensee or any of its stockholders or owners is interested, for any premise during the term of such suspension. At the end of such period of suspension, the licensee may apply for a new license or for reinstatement, as the case may be. 
(e)  (1)  If, following the hearing contemplated by paragraph (c) of this section, the council revokes the license, then no new license shall be issued to the licensee, or to any other firm in which the licensee or any of its stockholders or owners is interested, for a period of twelve (12) months. 
(2)  No new license shall be issued for a period of twelve (12) months for the operation or conduct of any business that is the same, or of similar nature, as that engaged in by the licensee at the premises or location at which the licensee conducted such business if the revocation or non-renewal of the license is based, in whole or in part, on: 
a.  A finding that the operation of such business at such premises or location has led to or resulted in the creation of a nuisance; or 
b.  A finding that the operation of such business at such premises or location has created, caused or led to circumstances that are detrimental to adjacent residential neighborhoods; or 
c.  A finding that the operation of such business at such premises or location has created, caused, or led to circumstances that are detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare; or 
d.  A finding that the operation of such business at such premises or location has resulted in a violation of applicable zoning restrictions or regulations; or 
e.  A finding that the licensee, his agent, servant or employee has permitted or suffered to allow habitual conduct which violates applicable state laws or regulations or city ordinances relating to the business for which such license is issued.

(Code 1965, § 41-10) 
Sec. 39-62. - False alarms. 
(a)  Findings. Due to the proliferation of security alarm systems throughout the City of Mobile (hereinafter "the city"), numerous instances of false alarms have occurred. Each false alarm causes useless expenditure of police time, risk associated with emergency response to police officers and to the public, and an inefficient allocation of available police patrol time. The cost to the public in unnecessary responses to false alarms is substantial. At current police officer's salaries and overhead rates, each false alarm costs the city approximately $50.00. In 1998 the Mobile police department responded to 35,734 false alarms (sixteen (16) percent of calls for service). These false alarm responses cost the city approximately $1,786,700.00. 
(b)  Purpose. To establish procedures to: (1) create a permitting system whereby security alarm systems within the city and its police jurisdiction will be required to obtain an annual permit for that system, and (2) create mechanisms for recording false security alarms and provide that the city be reimbursed for the cost incurred in responding to false security alarms. 
(c)  Definitions. 
(1)  False alarm means an alarm signal, whether monitored using the services of a monitoring company or not, which elicits a response by the police or any municipal emergency personnel, when a situation requiring a response by the police or other emergency personnel does not exist. False alarms do not include (1) an alarm signal caused by violent conditions of nature existing at the time of the alarm and verified by documentation from a weather service, (2) an alarm signal caused by testing of the alarm system, if advance notice of the test has been given to the Mobile police department, (3) alarms described in chapter 39, Article XII of the City Code, or (4) motor vehicle alarms. 
(2)  Alarm business means an economic enterprise conducted by an individual, partnership, corporation, or other entity which participates in selling, leasing, maintaining, servicing, repairing, offering, replacing, moving, or installing any alarm system in or on any building, structure, or facility within the city or its police jurisdiction. An individual, partnership, or corporation, or other entity engaged in the activities in this section must produce, on demand, a license required by Act 97-711, Acts of the Alabama Legislature (1997) and Mobile Electrical Ordinance No. 19-957, Section 27:124(b). 
(3)  Alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, arranged to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or an attempted illegal entry, robbery, or any other activity requiring urgent police attention, and to which the police are expected to respond. An automatic telephone-dialing device is an alarm system. 
(4)  Alarm user, or user means the person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, or organization of any kind in control of any building, structure, or facility wherein an alarm system is used or maintained. 
(5)  Automatic telephone dialing device means an alarm system which is activated by a signal or message, and which automatically sends a prerecorded voice message or coded signal by microwave, telephone line, or other method of transmission directly to Mobile County 911 or directly to the city police department indicating an unauthorized entry or attempted unauthorized entry to which the police are expected to respond. An automatic telephone dialing device not connected to Mobile County 911 or to the police department emergency communications system is not governed by this section. 
(6)  Date of receipt means the third day after notice to an alarm user has been delivered to the U.S. Postal Service, properly addressed with the postage prepaid. When a notice is hand-delivered to an alarm user, the date of receipt shall be the date the notice was hand-delivered by a municipal employee. 
(7)  Premises means any structure in or on which an alarm is installed. If two or more alarm systems operate independently on a structure under common ownership, each system is a separate alarm system for the purposes of this section. 
(8)  False alarm report means the statement prepared by the police officer(s) responding to an alarm determined to be a false alarm. The false alarm report shall be filed with the alarm officer by the responding officer via normal police department administrative channels, with a copy left at the premises. If the copy left at the premises is not delivered by hand to the alarm user, a back-up copy will be sent to the alarm user by first-class mail. An officer hand delivering the false alarm report shall indicate on the false alarm report the date and time delivered, and identify the recipient. 
(9)  Bill for false alarm cost means the administrative assessment issued by the alarm officer, or his/her designee, to the alarm user to accompany the fourth, and all subsequent false alarm reports issued to an alarm user in any calendar year. 
(10)  Alarm officer means the city employee, designated by the mayor, who shall receive false alarm reports, consider appeals as defined in subsection (k) of this section, and when required, issue bills for false alarm cost. The alarm officer shall be responsible for the maintenance and custody of all business records required for the efficient and accurate administration of this section. 
(d)  Nothing contained in this section will be construed to create any duty or responsibility on the city to respond to a security alarm or determine the effectiveness of any alarm system. It also does not create any duty or responsibility for the failure of an alarm system to operate properly, or for any loss damages that may result as a proximate consequence of the inoperability of an alarm system, or for the timeliness of police response to prevent injuries to individuals or premises. 
(e)  Illegal acts. The following acts are declared illegal, and in violation of this section. Any person, firm, or corporation committing any of the acts set forth in this section shall, on conviction, be punished as provided in Chapter I, Article II, section 1-21. It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to: 
(1)  Intentionally allow or cause a false alarm; 
(2)  Install, or cause to be installed, or operate, an audible alarm system which emits a sound substantially similar to an emergency vehicle's siren in the "wail" mode, or a Mobile County emergency management agency siren or warning device. An audible alarm emitting the "hi-lo" or "yelp" mode of an emergency vehicle's siren is permissible. 
(3)  Install, maintain, or operate an alarm system without an automatic reset device in the system to terminate the alarm within fifteen (15) minutes; 
(4)  Fail, or refuse to have a representative of the Alarm User respond to the premises where the alarm system has been activated within one (1) hour of the notification of the Alarm User of activation of the alarm; and 
(5)  Install an alarm other than in compliance with all state law and code requirements. The alarm business performing such installation shall be the responsible party under this Section. 
(f)  Determination of false alarm and payment of cost. 
(1)  A police officer responding to an activated alarm system shall inspect the premises to determine if there is evidence of an illegal entry or an attempted illegal entry, or other activity requiring urgent police response. Based on a reasonable inspection of the premises, and any other information that may be available to the officer at the site of the activated alarm, the officer shall make a determination if the alarm constituted a false alarm. If the officer determines that there was a false alarm, the officer shall make a false alarm report, indicating the date and times the officer(s), identified by name(s) and badge number(s), arrived at the premises and the reasons for determining that a false alarm has occurred. A copy of the false alarm report shall be given to the alarm user or representative, if present, or conspicuously attached to the premises. The responding officer shall return a copy of the false alarm report to the alarm officer. If the alarm user was not personally given the false alarm report by the responding officer at the premises, the alarm officer shall mail to the alarm user, by first class mail, the false alarm report. 
(2)  After receipt by an alarm user of the fourth, or any subsequent, false alarm report at any premises in one calendar year (January 1-December 31), and absent a determination that the alarm was not false, the alarm officer shall notify the alarm user that a billable false alarm has occurred at the premises. Multiple false alarms occurring within any given 24-hour period shall count as only one false alarm. With the fourth, or any subsequent false alarm report within one calendar year, a bill for false alarm cost shall be sent to the alarm user in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each such occurrence. This bill for false alarm cost shall be paid by the alarm user within thirty (30) days of receipt of the bill for false alarm cost. Any such bills unpaid after ninety days from date of issuance may be grounds for the police department to suspend false alarm response service to that premises until all such unpaid bills have been paid. 
(g)  Permit required; application; fee; transferability; false statements. 
(1)  No alarm user shall operate, or cause to be operated, an alarm system at its alarm site without a valid permit issued by the alarm officer. A separate permit is required for each alarm site. Any person operating a non-registered alarm system (whether suspended, expired, or never acquired) will be subject to an assessment of $100.00 for each false alarm, and may be denied further police alarm response services if deemed appropriate by the police department, in consultation with the alarm officer. 
(2)  The annual fee for a permit, or permit renewal, for an alarm site shall be $25.00 for a residence and $50.00 for a business. No refund of a permit or renewal fee, permit transfer, or permit proration will be made.

At the appeal, the alarm user may (1) present written evidence of violent conditions of nature, or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user causing the alarm to be activated, or (2) provide information to reasonably support the conclusion that an illegal entry, or an attempted illegal entry, or other activity occurred at the premises requiring urgent police attention did occur and activate the alarm, or (3) in the case of suspension of alarm response service, that substantial corrective action has been taken in accordance with the provisions of subsection (i) of this section. If the alarm officer is satisfied that the alarm was not a false alarm, or in the case of suspension of alarm response service, that the corrective elements in subsection (i) of this section have been satisfied, the alarm user shall be informed of this determination, the false alarm report will be cancelled, or service will be restored, and the alarm user's appeal fee of $25.00 will be refunded.

(n)  Government immunity. Requirements for permitting alarm systems are not intended to, nor will they create a contract, duty, or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By permitting an alarm system, the alarm user acknowledges that police response may be based on factors such as: availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, and staffing levels.

The applicant shall be notified of the initial determination and shall be provided a copy of the board's findings and reasons for the postponement. 
(h)  Postponement.

ARTICLE V. - OLD DAUPHIN WAY PRESERVATION DISTRICT 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 44-131. - Character of district. 
    The Old Dauphin Way District is an area of the city containing a number of significant landmark buildings recognized by the Historic American Buildings Survey and the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, by virtue of its having continued to grow and develop over the course of a century, the district possesses a distinctive character typical of a late nineteenth and early twentieth century residential neighborhood and provides a visual index to changing architectural styles from the 1850s to the present. 
(Ord. No. 81-064, § 1A, 6-5-79) 
Sec. 44-132. - Establishment. 
    There is hereby established the "Old Dauphin Way Preservation District." The Old Dauphin Way Preservation District is deemed worthy of protection by virtue of its possessing several important landmark structures and numerous streetscapes illustrative of late nineteenth and early twentieth century neighborhood development. The district is composed as shown by the boundaries of the Old Dauphin Way Preservation District map, which is hereby declared to be a part of this division, but which is not reproduced in the Code. 
(Ord. No. 81-064, § 1B, 6-5-79) 
Sec. 44-133. - Procedure for review of plans-Application; submission. 
(a)  Permit application. Application for review of plans for alterations of appearance, and for construction, renovation or demolition of a building within the preservation district must be made at least one (1) week prior to review at the next regular meeting of the Old Dauphin Way review board (ODWRB), usually held on the second Wednesday of each month at 2:00 p.m. Applications should be submitted to the office of inspection services at City Hall and a permit obtained in accordance with Section 105 of the building code of the city. If assistance is needed with the preparation of a proposal for presentation to the ODWRB, or there are any questions concerning that preparation, an appointment can be made at the design clinic. An ODWRB member will call if something is lacking on an application. 
(b)  Submission of plans. Every application for a building permit for a building located or to be located in the Old Dauphin Way Preservation District shall be accompanied by plans for the proposed building. As used herein, plans shall mean drawings or sketches with sufficient detail to show, as far as they relate to exterior appearance, the architectural design of the building, including proposed materials, textures and colors, and the plot plan or site layout, including fences, walks, terraces, planting, accessory buildings, signs, lights and other appurtenances. Preparing lots for parking purposes in the Old Dauphin Way Preservation District is considered a site improvement and requires a permit from the office of the inspection services director and the approval of the ODWRB. Such plans shall be forwarded by the inspection services director to the ODWRB for review. 
(c)  Review and decision. The ODWRB shall promptly review such plans and shall render its decision thereon as a written order to the inspection services director. 
(Ord. No. 81-064, § 3A-C, 6-5-79) 
Sec. 44-134. - Same-Specific criteria for presentation. 
(a)  Submissions on the project. In order that the ODWRB may render a decision expeditiously, applicants must prepare the following for presentation to the board: 
(1)  For new construction, or for extensive renovation or repair of existing structures: 
a.  A set of plans and renderings showing all exterior elevations including the following: 
1.  Overall dimensions. 
2.  Type of materials to be used on walls, roofs, windows, trim, etc. (Submit samples if possible.) 
3.  Elevation details where necessary. 
4.  Screening for utilities.

b.  Drawings or photographs of the area of the building to be altered or repaired if not the front elevation. (If the rear or side elevations affect the scene visible from the street and are to be altered, a photo showing the building's relationship to the neighboring structures and street scene is necessary.) 
c.  Either a written description or drawing of the work to be done, including materials to be used and paint samples. 
d.  Either a written description or drawing of site plan explaining fencing, screening, accessory buildings, etc. 
(3)  For painting renovation only: Applicant must submit photograph of structure to be painted. Samples of the paint colors to be used for the: 
a.  Main building. 
b.  Trim or decorative features. 
c.  Any other areas, such as foundation walls, shutters, etc. 
Applicant should refer to the paint charts furnished by the historic development commission for samples. 
(4)  For signs only: Signs must be compatible with street scene and character of neighborhood. Rendering of the proposed sign, showing: 
a.  Total area of sign. 
b.  Sample of lettering to be used. 
c.  Colors to be used, and paint. 
d.  Type of support or standard. 
e.  Proposed lighting, if any. 
(5)  For fencing only: Either a drawing or a photograph of the type of fencing proposed showing: 
a.  Placement on the lot. 
b.  Materials to be used. (See materials standards for guideline. Note that chainlink or wire fences are not acceptable where visible from street.) 
c.  The proposed height. (Fences within the preservation district are generally limited to a height of three (3) feet on the street and six (6) feet elsewhere.) 
d.  Paint samples, if the fence is to be painted. 
(6)  For demolition permits: 
a.  Photograph of the building to be demolished. 
b.  Statement of purpose of the demolition, with reference to the future land use of the site. Note: If the ODWRB determines the building to be of historic or architectural value, it can delay demolition for six (6) months, giving the Old Dauphin Way Association and the historic development commission the opportunity to develop an alternate plan for the preservation of the building. If no other plan can be developed which is acceptable to both the owner and the Old Dauphin Way Association and the historic development commission, a permit to demolish can be issued at the end of the six-month grace period. 
(b)  Material standards. The material standards presented herein are intended to be representative of the materials used on the original buildings in the Old Dauphin Way Preservation District in the period in which they were constructed. By setting such standards, it is the intention that all future restoration, repair, remodeling or additions will be compatible with the character of the district and maintain its architectural and historic integrity. By studying the standard set forth, the applicant for a permit for work in the preservation district can be guided in the preparation of the required plans to be submitted. The ODWRB will use the criteria for its evaluation of such plans. 
(c)  Goal of material standards. The goal of the Old Dauphin Way Review Board will be to encourage owners contemplating restoration, remodeling or additions to buildings within the district to eliminate existing materials which were not in conformity to the appearance of original construction, and return buildings to their original construction appearance. 
(d)  Material recommendations. The materials listed as "not recommended" serve to advise the owner of the prevailing opinion of the ODWRB as to the materials. The ODWRB will judge petitions to utilize "not recommended" materials on their merits, determining acceptability on the basis of conformity of appearance to original construction, or the overall character of the neighborhood.

(e)  New construction. Proposals for new construction need not seek to duplicate specific styles and historic periods. What is to be sought is compatibility with existing historic structures. Harmony with adjacent buildings and areas is to be sought through the appropriate use of scale, architectural elements, materials, details, roof shapes and treatment of the grounds. These six (6) characteristics are enumerated in some detail in the paragraphs which follow. They may be used in conjunction with the material standards, contained in this publication, to evaluate the appropriateness of each new proposal. In order for a proposal for a new structure to be acceptable, it should not substantially contradict the following: 
(1)  Scale: New buildings should be in scale with existing buildings. This will be taken to mean that the new building will not appear to be appreciably taller, shorter, wider, narrower or bulkier than the average buildings adjacent to it and those in the district. Also, the scale or size of elements will recall those of existing buildings, to include size of windows, doors, railings, masonry units, siding, balconies and dormers if used. 
(2)  Materials: Predominant materials used on the buildings in the district are wood siding, stucco, brick and stone. Materials which are considered to be inappropriate are large manufactured panels of plywood, hardboard, plastic or asbestos, imitation brick or stone. Though materials need not be limited to those which are existing, the criterion for judgement will be whether or not the new compliments the old. 
(3)  Details: The details on new buildings should be compatible and in scale with those which are used in the area. When used, cornices, lintels, arches, balustrades, chimneys, blinds and column styles which are sympathetic with adjacent existing details will have a unifying effect and will be considered favorably. Duplication is not necessary and is to be avoided. 
(4)  Elements: Where they exist or predominate in a particular area, porches, balconies, cupolas, chimneys, dormers and the like can be used to good effect in unifying a new structure with the neighborhood and will be considered as favorable when used in proper scale, even though they need not seek to imitate historic styles. Likewise, the use of compatible fences, walls and paving will count in favor of a design if these elements exist to any extent in the adjacent area. 
(5)  Roofs: Roof shapes and materials for new buildings should reflect the shape, scale and style of existing buildings of the historic period. There is no intention in this requirement to force designs into historic styles but rather to see that such a large and visible element of the building harmonizes with that of its neighbors. 
(6)  Grounds: Site planning should respect the precedents set by other buildings in the block. Setback should be similar, and landscaping which enhances the style of the district will be considered favorably. For example, in areas where many trees form a bower across the streets, planting should be planned to achieve a similar effect at full growth. Where they exist, the use of similar materials for paving, such as brick, tile pavers, stone blocks or similar materials will be considered favorably. Walls and fences similar to existing examples in the area will likewise be favored. 
(Ord. No. 81-064, § 3D, 6-5-79) 
Sec. 44-135. - Notification and building permit. 
(a)  Upon receiving the order of the board, the building inspector shall thereupon notify the applicant of the decision of the board. If the board shall have approved the plans, and if all other requirements of the City of Mobile have been met, the building inspector shall issue a permit for the proposed building. If the board shall have disapproved the plans, the building inspector shall not issue such permit. If the proposed building, alteration or demolition approved by the board does not require a permit pursuant to the Building Code in effect at the time of such approval, the building inspector shall issue an Old Dauphinway Review Board permit for such building, alteration or demolition for a permit fee of five dollars ($5.00). No person shall undertake a building, alteration or demolition in the district without a permit issued by the building inspector. Any building, alteration or demolition approved by the board shall be performed in strict conformity with the plans approved by the board. A violation of this article is a violation of the Building Code of the City of Mobile. 
    In a case where the board has disapproved the plans, the building inspector shall furnish the applicant with a copy of the board's written order, together with a copy of any recommendations for changes necessary to be made before the board will reconsider the plans. 
(Ord. No. 81-064, § 3E, 6-5-79; Ord. No. 81-022, § 1, 4-4-89) 
Sec. 44-136. - Failure to review plans. 
    If no action upon plans submitted to the ODWRB has been taken at the expiration of forty-five (45) days from the date of application for building permit and submission of plans, such plans shall be deemed to have been approved and, if all other requirements of the city have been met, the inspection services director shall issue a permit for the proposed building. 
(Ord. No. 81-064, § 3F, 6-5-79) 
Sec. 44-137. - Decisions of the board. 
(a)  General consideration. In passing upon plans, the ODWRB shall consider exterior design and appearance of the building, including the front, sides, rear and roof; materials, textures and colors; 
plot plan or site layout, including features such as walls, walks, terraces, planting, accessory buildings, signs and other appurtenances; and relation of the building to immediate surroundings and to the Old Dauphin Way Preservation District in which it is located or to be located. The term "exterior" shall be deemed to include all of the outer surfaces of the building visible from a public streetway or place. The ODWRB shall not consider interior design or plan, and it shall not impose any architectural style, traditional or modern, as a condition precedent to approval. The ODWRB shall not exercise any control over land use, such as is governed by the zoning ordinance, or over construction, such as is governed by the building code. 
(b)  Specific rules governing decisions. Before approving the plans for any proposed building located or to be located in the Old Dauphin Way Preservation District, the ODWRB shall find: 
(1)  In the case of a proposed alteration or addition to an existing building, that such alteration or addition will not materially impair the architectural or historic value of the building or impair the character of the immediate neighborhood in which the building is located. 
(2)  In the case of a proposed new building, that such building will not, in itself or by reason of its location on the site, materially impair the architectural or historical value of buildings on adjacent sites or in the immediate vicinity. 
(3)  In the case of a proposed new building, that such building will not impair the character of the immediate neighborhood in which the building is located. 
(4)  In the case of the proposed demolition of an existing building, that the removal of such building will not be detrimental to, or impair, the historic and architectural character of the district or that, balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity of the district and the interest of the owner of the property in the use of benefits of his property, approval of the plans for demolition is required by considerations of reasonable justice and equity; in the latter event the ODWRB shall issue an order postponing demolition for a period not to exceed six (6) months. If the ODWRB concludes that the demolition should be postponed, it shall, before issuing any final order with respect to such postponement, afford the applicant an opportunity to appear before the ODWRB to offer any evidence he may desire to present concerning the proposed order. Within the period of postponement, the ODWRB shall consult with the historic development commission and others to ascertain what the city or other agency or organization may do to preserve such architecturally or historically valuable building and shall make recommendations to that effect to the city council or otherwise cause the building to be preserved. 
When demolition of a significant structure is stayed by the ODWRB and the period of stay elapses, the inspection services director's office can issue a demolition permit. Such demolition permit issued after a stay period shall be effective for a period of twelve (12) months. If such demolition permit is not applied for and acted upon by significant demolition within the twelve-month period after and subsequent to a stay period which has been required, an application for demolition must be applied for as if one had not been applied for and qualified to be issued previously. 
(5)  In the case of a proposed addition to an existing building or the case of a proposed new building, that such addition or new building will not adversely affect the master plan of the city. 
(c)  Form of decision. Every decision of the ODWRB, in passing upon plans for buildings located or to be located in the district, shall be in the form of a written order stating the finding of the ODWRB, its decision and the reasons therefor. 
(d)  Recommendations for changes. The ODWRB shall not disapprove any plans without giving its recommendations for changes necessary to be made before the plans will be reconsidered. Such recommendations may be made before the plans will be reconsidered. Such recommendations may be general in scope, and compliance with them shall qualify the plans for reconsideration by the ODWRB. 
(e)  Member disqualified from voting. Any member of the ODWRB who shall be employed to design or construct a building or who shall have any proprietary, tenancy or personal interest in such building requiring approval of the plans by the ODWRB shall be disqualified from voting thereon. 
(Ord. No. 81-064, § 4, 6-5-79) 
Sec. 44-138. - Appeals. 
(a)  Procedure for appeal. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the ODWRB may, within fifteen (15) days thereafter, appeal therefrom to the city. He shall file with the ODWRB a written notice of appeal specifying the decision from which such appeal is taken. 
(b)  Transcript of proceedings. Upon receiving notice of appeal, the ODWRB shall transmit to the city a certified copy of the proceedings in the case. The issue shall be tried by the city solely on the question of whether the ODWRB, in rendering its decision, has acted beyond the limits of its powers or abused its discretion.

1.  All remaining broken glass shall be removed from the window opening including damaged frames as to provide a clean opening; 
2.  The sheeting material shall be cut to match the dimensions of the inside of the window casing so that when installed, the sheeting will fit tightly and not permit a tool to be placed behind it; 
3.  A 1/2-inch hole shall be drilled into each of the four corners of the sheeting material. The holes shall be positioned so they are no more than 1-inch from the window frame at the width and no more than 6 inches from the window sill and top frame. 
4.  Two solid continuous composite cross-beams shall be cut in sufficient length to be no less than 3.5 inches longer than the horizontal width of the interior window casing and extending not longer than 6 inches longer than the horizontal width of the interior window casing. Each cross-beam shall be predrilled with 7/16 -inch holes that are positioned to match the horizontal pattern of the holes in the sheeting. 
5.  The sheeting shall be secured in place over the exterior of the window opening by placing a 3/8 -inch corrosion resistant, smooth-head carriage bolt through each of the holes in the sheeting and then placing one washer onto each of the carriage bolts; the cross-beams shall then be aligned and affixed to such carriage bolts from the interior of the window opening. Another nut and washer shall be placed onto each of the carriage bolts and tightened with a ratchet to achieve sufficient torque and a slight deflection in the cross-beams so that the nuts cannot be loosened by hand. Once secured, no space shall exist between the sheeting and the exterior window casing. 
ii.  Exterior Screw Method. Fixed or inoperable windows with intact glass; or windows in which the internal compression method is impractical shall be secured as follows: 
1.  The sheeting material shall be cut to match the dimensions of the inside of the window casing so that when installed, the sheeting will fit tightly and not permit a tool to be placed behind it; 
2.  Drill and countersink holes shall be made along the perimeter of the sheeting material starting with a hole at each of the four corners and adding additional holes at 10-inch increments around the perimeter of the sheeting. Minimum length 2-inch corrosion resistant security head screws shall be used in each hole to affix the sheeting to the window frame or exterior casing. 
3.  In the event the sheeting cannot be secured by cutting the sheeting material so as to neatly fit the inside window casing, the sheeting shall be placed over the exterior window casing such that the sheeting material covers the entire window casing and is flush with the exterior dimension of the casing. The sheeting material shall be secured with minimum length 2-inch corrosion resistant security head screws secured at the corners, and along the sheeting outer edges in 10-inch spaced increments as described in subsection (a) above. 
iii.  Waivers. The code official may grant waivers from this section under, but not limited to, the following circumstances: 
1.  Physical characteristics which make installation of the sheeting impractical (for example, due to excessive frame, door and/or wall damage, or windows that are in an arc or other unusual inset or characteristic); 
2.  Economic Hardships; or, 
3.  Unavailability of the sheeting material. 
Properties the subject of the waiver may be secured in any manner, subject to the code official 's approval, necessary to achieve substantive compliance with this chapter.

ARTICLE VI. - REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREAS 

Sec. 52-151. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council has found and declared: 
(1)  That there exist in the city blighted areas, as defined herein, or areas in the process of becoming blighted; 
(2)  That such areas impair economic values and tax revenues, cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the city, and that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities; 
(3)  That restoration, clearance, re-planning, and/or rebuilding of these areas and the prevention or the reduction of blight and its causes are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are considered governmental functions of state and city concern; 
(4)  That the traditional method of boarding up windows with plywood is unsightly and can contribute to blight and decline in property values in neighborhoods with large number of vacant and abandoned buildings; 
(5)  That redevelopment activities will stimulate residential construction which is closely correlated with general economic activity and that the undertakings authorized by this chapter will aid the production of better housing and more desirable neighborhood and community development at lower costs and will make possible a more stable and larger volume of residential construction, which will assist materially in achieving and maintaining full employment; and

(2)  The city holds the rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens. The city and other public entities have invested millions of dollars in public funds to build and maintain the rights-of-way. 
(3)  The city possesses the authority to manage and control its rights-of-way and to enact reasonable regulations in furtherance thereof. 
(4)  The primary purpose of the city's streets, sidewalks, and other rights-of-way is to safely accommodate the traveling public and pedestrian traffic. 
(5)  The proliferation of entities that have been licensed by the states and the potential for additional entities having the need to occupy the city's streets, sidewalks, and other rights-of-way, necessitates the modernization of the city's regulations used to control the placement, construction and maintenance of facilities owned by existing and potential rights-of-way users. 
(6)  In response to the foregoing facts, the city hereby amends chapter 57 of the Mobile City Code relating to rights-of-way construction and administration. This article imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of facilities currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. 
(7)  The regulations embodied herein have been made as broad as possible to serve as standards of quality and to maintain the necessary uniformity in the utilization of the public traffic corridors. 
(8)  The permit fees imposed by section 57-234 of this article are adopted pursuant to the city's police power. The purpose of the permit fees is to enable the city to recover its costs of administration and enforcement and not for the purpose of raising revenue. 
(c)  Easements not impaired. Nothing in this article is intended to impair the legal obligation of any contract, franchise, or easement previously granted by the city. 
(d)  Not in lieu of franchise. Compliance with the permitting requirements of this article shall not excuse any person from complying with all other requirements of law, including holding a valid franchise of the city. 
(e)  Area of jurisdiction. This article shall apply to all land within the corporate limits of the city as such corporate limits exist or may exist in the future.

(1)  Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to this article as a privilege and not as a right. 
(2)  If the city engineer determines that the permittee has violated a material term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city engineer shall issue a notice of violation to the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for the issuance of a stop work order and issuance of a municipal offense ticket. Further, a substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city engineer, at his or her discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit. 
A material violation by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
a.  The violation of any material provision of the permit; 
b.  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens; 
c.  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a permit; 
d.  The failure to maintain the required bonds and/or insurance; 
e.  The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or 
f.  The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section 57-235(f). 
(3)  Within forty-eight (48) hours of receiving a notice of violation, permittee shall contact the city engineer with a plan, acceptable to the city engineer, for its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the city engineer, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate issuance of a stop work order and issuance of a municipal offense ticket. 
(4)  From time to time, the city engineer may establish a list of conditions of the permit that will automatically warrant the issuance of a municipal offense ticket to the permittee.

(1)  The owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of the motor vehicle may, upon a showing of satisfactory proof of ownership or entitlement of possession to the proper members of the police department, pay the immobilization, towing and storage fees, recover the vehicle and, if it is desirable, may demand a hearing in the municipal court at a later date on the question of responsibility for the immobilization, towing and storage fees. If any member of the police department feels that it is necessary to hold the motor vehicle and not release it under this option, then the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of the motor vehicle may proceed under option (2) as provided herein; or, 
(2)  The owner or other person claiming to be the owner or claiming to be lawfully entitled to possession of the motor vehicle may demand a hearing in the municipal court on the questions of immediate possession of the vehicle and the payment of any immobilization, towing and storage fees. If reasonably practical, a hearing will be held at the same time on any alleged violation of law pertaining to the immobilization or towing of the vehicle. The hearing on the questions of immediate possession of the vehicle and the payment of any immobilization, towing and storage fees as provided for in this option must be held within twenty-four (24) hours (excluding holidays and weekends) from the time that the owner or other person claiming to be the owner or claiming to be lawfully entitled to possession of the motor vehicle notifies the clerk of the municipal court of the demand for a hearing. 
(b)  In the event that the owner or other person claiming to be the owner or claiming to be lawfully entitled to possession of the vehicle chooses option (1) in paragraph (a) above, and the judge presiding at any hearing provided for in option (1) finds that this person shall not be responsible for the payment of the immobilization, towing and storage fees, then the clerk of the municipal court shall supply the person with proof of the finding and he may submit this, along with a request for a refund of his immobilization, towing and storage fees, to the legal department of the city, which will then process the refund.

(d)  All demands for a hearing under this section shall be made to the clerk of the municipal court. 
(e)  It shall be the responsibility of the Mobile police officer causing any motor vehicle to be immobilized or towed to see that the owner or person claiming to be the owner or claiming to be lawfully entitled to possession is notified of the immobilization and/or towing, and also of the options available under this section. The officer may satisfy this requirement by supplying necessary information to the police operator and requesting that the operator make the required notification. The police operator will then make every reasonable effort, including the use of telephones or use of the mails if necessary, to make the required notification as soon as possible. The operator shall notify the requesting officer when such notification has been made. After attempting notification every five (5) days for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive days without success, the operator shall notify the requesting officer of the lack of notification, whereupon the officer shall notify the proper official within the police department of the circumstances so that proper disposition of the motor vehicle may be made.

(g)  In those cases where pursuant to the authority or paragraph (c) above, an immobilized and/or towed vehicle is released to the owner or other person found to be lawfully entitled to possession thereof without the person being responsible for any immobilization, towing or storage fees, then the city shall bear the expense of immobilization, towing and storage. However, said storage fee shall not exceed seventy-two (72) hours storage; provided, that the city shall bear any additional storage fees caused by any delay which is found to be the fault of the city including any delay caused by weekends or holidays. The owner, person lawfully entitled to possession, or the person in possession of the motor vehicle at the time that it was immobilized or towed shall be responsible for any additional storage fees beyond seventy-two (72) hours storage if the delay was not due to the fault of the city or due to a weekend or holiday. 
(h)  In those cases where a refund is warranted under paragraph (b) above, the city shall refund the immobilization, towing and storage fees up to seventy-two (72) hours storage, provided that the city shall bear any additional storage fees caused by any delay which is found to be the fault of the city including any delay caused by weekends or holidays. The owner, person lawfully entitled to possession, or the person in possession of the motor vehicle at the time that it was towed shall be responsible for any additional storage fees beyond seventy-two (72) hours storage if the delay was not due to the fault of the City or due to a weekend or holiday.

In case of street vacation, where district boundaries are indicated as following lot lines at the edges of streets, such boundaries shall be construed as moving to the center line of the prior street. Questions concerning the exact location of any district boundary shall be decided by the board of adjustment. 
4.  Amendment policy. See section 64-9. 
5.  Sizes of new districts. There are no minimum sizes for new districts created by amendment of this chapter; provided, however, that the minimum sizes set out below shall serve as general guides. New districts of smaller size may be created where unusual conditions or circumstances justify them in the opinion of the commission. 
a.  R-2, R-3, R-B, B-3, B-4, B-5, H-B, I-1, and I-2 districts. A proposed new R-2, R-3, R-B, B-3, B-4, B-5, H-B, I-1, or I-2 district should contain at least four acres of gross area; provided, however, that a proposed R-3 or R-B district which would abut an existing B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, I-1 or I-2 district, a proposed B-3 district which would abut an existing B-4, H-B, I-1 or I-2 district, a proposed B-4 district that would abut an existing I-1 or I-2 district, and a proposed I-1 district which would abut an existing I-2 district shall be exempt from this guideline. 
b.  B-1 and B-2 districts. A proposed new B-1 or B-2 district should contain at least two acres of gross area; provided, however, that a proposed B-1 district which would abut an existing B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, I-1 or I-2 district and a proposed B-2 district which would abut an existing B-3, or B-4 district shall be exempt from this guideline. 
c.  R-1 districts. There is no requirement of minimum size for new R-1 districts. 
B.  Residential-agricultural districts. 
1.  R-A districts: residential-agricultural districts. These districts are composed of mainly open subdivided lands that are vacant or in agricultural, forest, or single-family residential uses. It is intended that these districts provide for a full range of agricultural and farming activities and protect these established uses from encroaching development. The farmer has a right to farm without being restricted by neighboring residential districts or nonagricultural uses. It is further intended that the districts protect existing natural resources and scenic values and provide a spacious residential environment for residents of the community. In accordance with these intentions, the following provisions for the protection of agricultural uses will apply: 
a.  Permitted uses. Any agricultural or forestry use of land is permitted, including activities relating to the raising or caring of farm animals or pets. See chart at end of this section. 
b.  Secondary uses. Activities related to farming, such as the operation of machinery used in production or processing of agricultural products, is permitted. The sale of agricultural products on the farm where they were produced is permitted. 
c.  Building site area. Except where provided in section 64.4, the minimum building site area shall be: 
Square feet For a one-family dwelling 7,200 For any other permitted use 10,000  
d.  Building site coverage. The maximum building site coverage by all buildings shall be thirty-five (35) percent. 
e.  Building height limit. Except as provided in section 64.4, no structure shall be designed, erected or altered to exceed thirty-five (35) feet. 
f.  Yards required. Except as provided in section 64.4, the minimum dimensions of yards shall be: 
Feet Front yard 25 Side yard 8  
(The sum of the widths of the two side yards shall be at least twenty (20) feet) 
Feet Rear yard 8  
g.  Buffer protection between districts. The planning commission may impose additional buffer protection strips where necessary to protect abutting agricultural districts from the impact of the subdivisions hereafter approved. 
C.  Residential districts. 
1.  R-1 districts: One-family residential districts. These districts are composed of both developed and largely undeveloped areas. The developed areas contain mainly one-family dwellings and small open areas, usually subdivided, where residential development seems likely to occur; few two-family and multiple-family dwellings are found in these developed areas. It is anticipated that most of the large undeveloped areas will ultimately be developed for residential use. The district regulations are designed to protect the residential character of the developed areas by prohibiting all commercial activities; to encourage a suitable neighborhood environment for family life by including among the permitted uses such facilities as schools and churches; and to preserve the openness of the areas by requiring certain minimum yard and area standards to be met. Reclassification of the land or other appropriate residential, commercial or industrial categories shall be in accordance with the amendment procedure set forth herein. 
a.  Permitted uses. See chart at end of chapter. 
b.  Building site area. Except as provided in section 64-4, the minimum building site area shall be: 
Square 
feet  For a one-family dwelling 7,200 For any other permitted use 10,000  
  
c.  Building site coverage. The maximum building site coverage by all buildings shall be thirty-five (35) percent. 
d.  Building height limit. Except as provided in section 64-4, no structure shall be designed, erected or altered to exceed thirty-five (35) feet. 
e.  Yards required. Except as provided in section 64-4, the minimum dimensions of yards shall be:

2.  Districts: Two-family residence districts. These districts are composed mainly of areas containing a mixture of one-family and two-family dwellings and open areas where similar residential development seems likely to occur. The district regulations are designed to protect the residential character of the areas by prohibiting all commercial activities; to encourage a suitable neighborhood environment for family life by including among the permitted uses such facilities as schools and churches; and to preserve the openness of the areas by requiring certain minimum yard and area standards to be met. 
a.  Permitted uses. See chart at end of chapter. 
b.  Building site area. Except as provided in section 64-4, the minimum building site area shall be: 
Square

3.  R-3 districts: Multiple-family districts. These districts are composed mainly of areas containing a mixture of one-family, two-family, and multiple-family dwellings; in many of them there is evident a trend toward increased population density through conversion of large houses into apartments and through use of remaining vacant land for apartment buildings. The district regulations are designed to protect the residential character of the areas by prohibiting all commercial activities; to encourage a suitable neighborhood environment for family life by including among the permitted uses such facilities as schools and churches; to prevent overcrowding of the land by requiring certain minimum yard and other open spaces for all buildings; and to avoid excessive population density by requiring a certain minimum building site area for each dwelling unit. 
a.  Permitted uses. See chart at end of chapter. 
b.  Building site area. Except as provided in section 64-4, the minimum building site area shall be: 
Square 
feet  For a one-family dwelling 7,200 For a two-family dwelling 8,000 For a multiple-family dwelling 8,000 First two dwelling units 8,000 Each additional dwelling unit 1,500 For any other permitted use 10,000

D.  Residence-business districts. 
1.  R-B districts: Residence-business districts. Usually located near the downtown center of the city, these districts are composed of a mixture of residential and light commercial uses. They may contain buildings marked by the Historic American Buildings Survey or by the Historic Preservation Society for their architectural or historic interest and value. The district regulations are designed to protect the character of the area or to encourage further appropriate development, with a mixture of residential, public and semipublic and light commercial uses. 
a.  Permitted uses. See chart at end of chapter. 
b.  Building site area. Except as provided in section 64-4, the minimum building site area shall be: 
Feet  For a one-family dwelling 5,000 For a two-family dwelling 6,000 For a multiple-family dwelling: First two (2) dwelling units 6,000 Each additional dwelling unit 1,500  
For any other permitted use there is no minimum building site area required except that sufficient area shall be provided for off-street parking and off-street loading spaces as required in section 64-6. 
c.  Building site coverage. The maximum building site coverage by all buildings shall be seventy-five (75) percent.

e.  Yards required. Except as provided in section 64-4, the minimum dimensions of yards shall be: 
Feet Front yard 5 Side yard None Rear yard None  
2.  T-B districts: Transitional-business districts. The transitional business district (TB) is intended for small sites in or near dense residential neighborhoods on, at or near a major or collector street. The district regulations encourage the provision of small-scale retail and service uses for nearby residential areas. Some uses that are not retail or service in nature are also allowed so a variety of uses may locate in existing buildings. Uses are restricted in size, number and character to promote a local orientation and to limit adverse impacts on nearby residential areas. Development is intended to be pedestrian-oriented and compatible with the scale of surrounding residential areas. Parking areas are restricted, since their appearance is generally out of character with the surrounding residential development and the desired orientation of the uses. 
a.  Permitted uses. See Chart at end of chapter. 
b.  Building site area. Except as provided in section 64-4, the minimum building site area shall be:

Rear yard: None 
f.  Parking configuration and design. No more than a single row of angled parking stalls shall be located between the principle structure and a street. Minimum required parking facilities shall be in accordance with section 64-6 of this chapter; however, for general business/retail/office uses, a maximum parking ratio of one (1) space per two hundred (200) square feet of gross floor area will be allowed. Any parking spaces provided in excess of the ratio of one (1) space per two hundred (200) square feet shall be of an alternative parking surface, as defined in section 64-2 of this chapter. Also, restaurants and other food/beverage uses shall be limited to a maximum parking ratio of one (1) space per seventy-five (75) square feet.

Retail: 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
Restaurants: 6 a.m. to 12 a.m. 
E.  Business districts. 
1.  B-1 districts: Buffer business districts. These districts are composed of land and structures occupied by or suitable for such uses as offices, studios and automobile storage (commercial), including parking lots. Although usually located between residential areas and business areas, these districts are in some instances free-standing in residential areas or they may include hospital, college or other public or semipublic groups and related uses. The district regulations are designed to protect and encourage the buffer character of the districts by limiting the permitted uses to dwellings and uses of a semicommercial nature and to protect the abutting and surrounding residential areas by requiring certain minimum yard and area standards to be met, standards that are comparable to those called for in the residence districts.

e.  Yards required. Except as provided in section 64-4, the minimum dimensions of yards shall be: 
Feet Front yard 25 Side yard 5 Rear yard 5  
2.  B-2 districts: Neighborhood business districts. These districts are composed of land and structures occupied by or suitable for furnishing the retail goods, such as groceries and drugs, and the services, such as barbering and shoe repairing, to satisfy the daily household needs of the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Often located on a thoroughfare or near the intersection of two (2) thoroughfares, these districts are small and are within convenient walking distance of most of the areas they will serve. The district regulations are designed to permit the development of the districts for their purpose and to protect the abutting and surrounding residential areas by requiring certain minimum yard and area standards to be met, standards that are comparable to those called for in residential districts. It is intended that additional neighborhood business districts will be created, in accordance with the amendment procedure set forth herein, as they are needed to serve new residential areas. To insure that such new districts are actually developed to supply the business needs of the neighborhoods, the amendment creating the district may set a time limit for its development. 
a.  Permitted uses. See chart at end of chapter. 
b.  Building site area. There is no minimum required building site area. 
c.  Building site coverage. The maximum building site coverage by all buildings shall be fifty (50) percent.

Feet Front yard 25 Side yard None Rear yard None  
2.5.  Limited B-2 (LB-2) districts: Limited-neighborhood business district. These districts are composed of land and structures occupied by or suitable for furnishing retail goods, such as groceries and drugs, and services, such as barbering and shoe repairing, to satisfy the daily household needs of the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Locational guidelines for LB-2 districts are the same as for B-2 districts. Often located on a thoroughfare or near the intersection of two (2) thoroughfares, these districts are small and are within convenient walking distance of most of the areas they will serve. The district regulations are designed to permit the development of the districts for their purpose and to protect the abutting and surrounding residential areas by prohibiting certain commercial uses and requiring certain minimum yard and area standards to be met with standards that are comparable to those called for in residential districts. LB-2 does not supplant or replace B-1, but is another option for certain permitted uses in lieu of B-2. It is intended that additional limited-business districts will be created in accordance with the amendment procedure set forth herein, as they may be needed to serve residential areas. To ensure that such new districts are actually developed to supply the business needs of the neighborhoods, the amendment creating the district may set a time limit for its development. 
a.  Permitted uses. See chart at end of the chapter. 
b.  Building site area. There is no minimum required building site area. 
c.  Building site coverage. The maximum building site coverage by all buildings shall be fifty (50) percent.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 64-002, § I, adopted February 4, 2003, amended the Code by adding a new subsection E.3 to § 64-3. In order to prevent duplication of subsection numbers, the editor has designated the new provisions as subsection E.2.5 of § 64-3. 
3.  B-3 districts: Community business districts. These districts are composed of land and structures used to furnish, in addition to the retail goods and services found in neighborhood business districts, such less frequently needed goods as clothing and automobiles-the wider range of retail goods and services to satisfy all the household and personal needs of the residents of a group or community of neighborhoods. Light or heavy distribution uses may be allowed as defined in the chart of permitted uses. Usually located on a thoroughfare or near the intersection of two (2) thoroughfares, these districts are large and are within convenient driving distance of the group of neighborhoods they will serve. The district regulations are designed to permit the development of the districts for their purpose in a spacious arrangement. 
To protect the abutting and surrounding residential areas certain restrictions are placed on uses. It is intended that additional community business districts will be created in accordance with the amendment procedure set forth herein, as they are needed to serve groups of new neighborhoods. To insure that such districts are actually developed to supply the business needs of the groups of neighborhoods, the amendment creating the district may set a time limit for its development.

4.  B-4 districts: General business districts. These districts are composed of land and structures used to furnish, in addition to the retail goods and services found in the community business district, the wider range of retail goods and services required by transients and by residents of the metropolitan area and of the trade area, as well as certain wholesale and limited manufacturing and distributing in support of the main uses. Located at the convergence of the principal thoroughfares and highways, as well as transit lines, the central business district is the largest district of this type and contains the high concentration of commercial activities, that is the distinguishing characteristic of the general business district. 
The district regulations are designed to regulate the development of the districts for their purposes, subject to limitations designed to prevent the congestion that would result from overintensive development. 
a.  Permitted uses. See chart at end of chapter. 
b.  Building site area. There is no minimum building site area. 
c.  Building site coverage. The maximum building site coverage by all buildings shall be one hundred (100) percent. 
d.  Building height limit. There is no maximum height limit. 
e.  Yards required. No yards are required. 
5.  B-5 districts: Office-distribution districts. These districts are intended for a mixture of certain commercial and light industrial uses such as administrative offices of business and industrial concerns, uses engaged in the handling, warehousing and distribution of materials and equipment, manufacturing uses limited to assembly or repair operations, and research activities for scientific and technological businesses. Design standards for site development should promote a commercial, rather than industrial, atmosphere. All activities shall take place entirely within the structure. 
Desirable locations for these districts, which should serve as a transition between commercial and industrial districts, include sites with interstate access, along principal thoroughfares and highways, areas convenient to major commercial or industrial concentrations, and to a lesser extent, along rail lines.

A minimum distance of sixty-five (65) feet from the loading area to the right-of-way is recommended for truck maneuverability. 
6.  H-B districts: Historic-business district. These districts are composed of areas containing architecturally or historically valuable buildings. By reason of location and accessibility, the districts are suitable for specialty shopping and entertainment activities for tourist and local trade. The district regulations are designed to protect the special character of the areas, to encourage restoration of architecturally and historically valuable buildings and their adaptation to house permitted uses and to encourage further appropriate development for a limited number of mutually supporting light business and cultural uses. 
a.  Permitted uses. See chart at end of zoning ordinance for the City of Mobile. 
In addition to the uses shown in the chart, the following uses are permitted under the conditions specified:

G.  Historic district overlay. 
1.  Findings and purpose. The City of Mobile has worked vigorously to protect and enhance its numerous historic resources. Through the enactment of the historic preservation maintenance ordinance and minimum housing codes, many of the city's historically significant properties have been restored and maintained. However, vacant structures and underutilized land within these historic districts remain. To encourage more development activity, the historic district overlay (HDO) has been formulated to promote and encourage development within the city's historic districts and other identified areas. 
The purpose of the historic district overlay (HDO) is to establish flexible land development requirements that preserve and maintain the existing character of historically significant areas by formulating site development standards that: 1) allow compatible or similar development within the city's historic districts and other defined areas; and 2) simplify and streamline the site plan review and approval process by reducing the necessity for variances and waivers. The site design elements to be addressed by the HDO will deal specifically with guidelines formulated for the "building envelope" (i.e. setbacks, site coverage, and building height requirements) for all zoning classifications with the exception of properties zoned LB-2, B-2 and B-3. Future evaluation will be conducted to address the application of site development standards for properties zoned LB-2, B-2 and B-3. 
2.  Applicability. The regulation and criteria set forth in this section are applicable to the geographic areas defined in the Historic District Overlay Boundary (HDOB) with respect to specific site development requirements. However, the underlying zoning standards regulating the use of land remain applicable. For example, all regulations for permitted land uses, trees, landscaping, parking, buffers etc. will remain in place as outlined in their respective ordinances. This HDO ordinance shall not apply to properties zoned LB-2, B-2 and B-3. 
3.  Building envelope. The following are setback, site coverage and height requirements for structures located in the Historic District Overlay Boundary. If there are no existing buildings within 150 feet of the proposed development, then the building envelope criteria may be determined using the dimensions and placement of the buildings on the next adjoining block. 
a.  Yard Dimensions. 
(1)  Front yard setback: The front yard setback shall be no greater or lesser than the setback of those structures on the same side of the street within 150 feet of both sides (exclusive of right-of-way) of the proposed building site (See Diagram 1). 
(2)  Side yard setback (each side): The side yard setback may be no less than the side yards of those structures on the same side of the street within 150 feet of both sides (exclusive of right-of-way) of the proposed building site. In the case of an addition to an existing structure, the addition may be in line with the existing building (See Diagram 2). 
Side yard setbacks on side streets may be no less than the side yard setback of the other corner lots, along the same side street, at the same intersection. If there is no structure by which to measure, then the setback requirements of section 64-4-D4 shall apply. 
(3)  Rear yard setback: The rear yard setback may be no less than the rear yards of those structures on the same side of the street within 150 feet of both sides (exclusive of right-of-way) of the proposed building. In the case of an addition to an existing structure, the addition may be in line with the existing building (See Diagram 3). 
If a side or rear setback is less than five (5) feet from the property line, gutters and downspouts shall be provided. 
b.  Maximum building coverage. The maximum building site coverage by all buildings shall not exceed 50 percent; excluding lots zoned R-B, B-4, I-1 and I-2. In cases of commercial development, the maximum coverage allowed does not override the requirement of other development regulations (i.e. provision of trees, landscaping, parking, buffers, etc.). 
c.  Building height. Building height shall be no higher than the highest building on the same side of the street within 150 feet of both sides (exclusive of right-of-way) of the proposed building site; excluding lots zoned B-4, I-i and 1-2 (See Diagram 4).

H.  Traditional center district. 
1.  Purpose and intent. The city seeks to create a traditional center district (TCD), which establishes land development requirements that enable and encourage traditional, walkable village and neighborhood centers, and bring a balance between vehicular and pedestrian-oriented design. These standards were created to 
1)  Enable street-oriented, pedestrian-friendly development within the defined TCD areas by approving building placement and parking requirements conducive to walkable districts, and 
2)  Encourage the creation of traditional centers by prescribing building standards, signage requirements, and other details that contribute to the pedestrian realm. 
2.  Administration 
a.  Applicability. The regulations and criteria set forth in this section are applicable to the geographic areas within the traditional center district boundary (TCDB), with respect to specific site and land development requirements (See figures 1 and 2). Properties being developed or redeveloped within the TCDB shall either comply with all existing applicable regulations or comply with all applicable regulations of the TCD. A property owner may elect to develop or redevelop a property under the applicable regulations of the TCD by filing a written statement when submitting application for a building permit; unless that election is made, each respective property will be governed by the existing non-TCD regulations set forth in the city zoning ordinance. Once TCD designation has been elected, except where explicitly provided to the contrary, whenever the requirements of these overlay regulations are in conflict with the requirements of chapter 64, zoning ordinance of the city, the requirement within this overlay ordinance shall supersede. However, the underlying requirements remain applicable where this overlay remains silent. 
b.  Graphics and illustrations. In case of conflict between any figure and any text in this overlay ordinance, the text shall apply and supersede the graphic or illustration. 
c.  Guide to using the TCD. 
(1)  Identify the properties that are part of the TCD (as shown on figures 1 and 2). 
(2)  Refer to the regulating plans (figures 3-5), and identify the subdistrict within which the property is located. 
(3)  Amendments to the regulating plan shall follow the standard procedures to amend the zoning ordinance and the comprehensive plan. 
(4)  Refer to section 64-3.H.3, subdistricts, for regulations on building form, placement, and height, specific to the subdistrict. 
(5)  Refer to section 64-3.H.4, supplementary regulations in the TCD, for additional standards that apply to all subdistricts, including building standards and landscape standards. 
(6)  Refer to section 64-3.H.5, planned unit developments, for guidance on planned unit developments on property within the TCD. 
(7)  Refer to section 64-3.H.6, off-street parking and loading, to identify parking and loading location and design standards.

Figure 2: Traditional Center District Boundary Detail Location Map 
(8)  Refer to section 64-3.H.7, signs in the TCD, to identify the types of signage allowed in the TCD, and size and placement requirements. 
3.  Subdistricts. The TCD is divided into designated subdistricts, as shown on the regulating plans (see figures 3-5). The subdistricts reflect the character in the various areas within the TCD. The subdistricts are identified as: 
  Village center 
  Neighborhood center 
  Neighborhood general 
a.  Regulating plans. Figures 3-5 contain the regulating plans for the TCD. The regulating plans identify the location of the subdistricts, and primary and secondary frontages for all properties within the TCD. Proposed new streets located on the regulating plans are permitted, but not required. At the time of development or redevelopment of a property, the inclusion of a new street is at the discretion of the property owner. These new street locations are schematic to allow flexibility in the design of the site plan. 
(1)  Amendments to a regulating plan. Amendments to a regulating plan shall follow procedures as required for any amendment to the zoning ordinance or comprehensive plan. Such procedures shall include a call for public hearing, legal advertisements, and public hearing(s) by the planning commission and city council. A recommendation on the amendment is forwarded by the planning commission to the city council. The city council shall either approve or deny the proposed amendment. 
b.  Village center subdistrict. This district is the most densely occupied subdistrict, and consists of street-oriented, mixed-use buildings that may accommodate a range of uses including retail, offices, residential, and civic uses. The village center serves the needs of the surrounding community; the walkable, park-once environment is accommodating to both pedestrians from surrounding neighborhoods, as well as those from the greater community. The district has wide sidewalks, regular street tree planting, and buildings set close to the sidewalks to create a regular street facade. 
(1)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses in the underlying zoning requirements remain applicable. 
(2)  Building envelope. The following apply to buildings within the village center subdistrict: 
(a)  Building site area. There is no minimum building site area required. 
(b)  Building site coverage. The maximum building site coverage by all buildings shall be ninety (90) percent.

In addition, storefronts must comply with the following: 
(a)  The ground story's primary facade must have transparent storefront windows covering no less than fifty (50) percent of its principal plane in order to provide clear views of merchandise in stores and to provide natural surveillance of exterior street spaces (see figure 6). 
(b)  Doors allowing public access to streets must be provided at intervals no greater than fifty (50) feet to maximize street activity, to provide pedestrians with frequent opportunities to enter buildings, and to minimize any expanses of inactive wall. 
(c)  Figures. 
Figure 6: Facade Transparency Example 


(3)  Liner buildings. The character of some uses of land, such as theaters, grocery stores, parking structures, and other large-footprint uses would preclude their buildings from complying with the door and window requirements of this overlay code. Such buildings shall be constructed in a manner that they will be separated from primary frontages by liner buildings (see figure 7): 
(a)  Liner buildings shall be at least as tall as the building they are screening, and must comply with the height requirements of the subdistrict in which they are located. Liner buildings shall be no less than twenty (20) feet in depth. 
(b)  Liner buildings may be detached from or attached to the buildings they are concealing. 
(c)  Liner buildings may be used for any purpose allowed on the lot on which they are located except for parking. 
(d)  Liner buildings shall meet the primary facade transparency requirements in subsection H.4.b.(2) of this ordinance. 
(e)  Figures. 

Figure 7: Liner Building Example 
(4)  Large footprint buildings. Buildings with a footprint greater than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet may be built within the village center and neighborhood center subdistricts. Such buildings must abide by requirements in the TCD overlay ordinance with the following special limitations: 
(a)  Large footprint buildings may be permitted to be one story in height on any frontage except Old Shell Road and McGregor Avenue, but shall be at least twenty four (24) feet in height. This may be accomplished with higher ceiling heights and/ or parapets or by having a liner building between the one story building and the frontage on Old Shell Road and/ or McGregor Avenue. 
(b)  Buildings shall not be larger than a single block. 
(5)  Frontage percentages. Frontage percentage is the percentage of the width of a lot that is required to be occupied by its building's primary facade. Sections 64-3.H.3.b through 64-3.H.3.d provides minimum and maximum frontage percentages for each subdistrict. 
(a)  The location of the primary facade's principal plane is not changed by facade extensions such as bay windows, awnings, porches, balconies, stoops, colonnades, galleries, or arcades, or by upper stories that are closer to or further from the street. 
(b)  Up to fifty (50) percent of the width of the primary facade may be counted as meeting the frontage percentage requirement even though it may be set back up to ten (10) feet further from the street than the primary facade's principal plane (see figure 8). 
(c)  Forecourts. A portion of the building's primary facade may be set back up to twenty (20) feet further from the street than the primary facade's principal plane if this space is constructed as a forecourt, chamfered corner, or pedestrian entryway that is open to the sidewalk. This recessed portion may be up to forty (40) percent of the total width of the primary facade and may not be used by vehicles (see figure 9). On courtyard buildings, this forecourt may extend beyond twenty (20) feet into a central garden or courtyard. 
(d)  Civic spaces and civic buildings. Civic spaces and civic buildings are except from frontage percentage requirements. 
(e)  Figures.

Partial walls and railings on porches may be no higher than forty-two (42) inches. Porches may not extend into the right-of-way. 
(9)  Stoops. Stoops may extend forward of the build-to zone. Partial walls and railings on stoops may be no higher than forty-two (42) inches. Stoops may extend into the right-of-way, provided that a minimum five (5) feet clear sidewalk access is maintained for pedestrians, and a right-of-way permit is obtained. 
Story heights. The ground story of commercial and mixed-use buildings must be from twelve (12) feet to eighteen (18) feet tall. The ground story of residential buildings must be from ten (10) to fourteen (14) feet tall. Each story above the ground story in commercial and residential buildings must be from eight (8) feet to twelve (12) feet tall; any upper story taller than twelve (12) feet will count as two (2) stories. Story heights are measured from the finished floor to the bottom of the lowest structural member that supports the story or roof structure above. 
(10)  Residential floor elevation. Residential buildings must have the floor of their first habitable story elevated at least two and one-half (21/2) feet above the adjacent sidewalk. If this floor is more than five (5) feet above the adjacent sidewalk, the space below counts as the ground (first) story for purposes of measuring building height. 
(11)  Exterior building lighting. The treatment of exterior building lighting is important with an impact on public safety and welfare. Lighting should be done in such a way as to avoid intense point-sources of light. 
(a)  All outdoor lighting shall be shielded or directed so that all of the illumination falls upon either the surface of the structure to be illuminated, or on the ground. 
(b)  Light fixtures shall be downcast or low cut-off fixtures to prevent glare and light pollution. 
(c)  At the front of the building, exterior lights shall be mounted between six (6) feet and fourteen (14) feet above adjacent grade. 
(d)  Floodlighting shall not be used to illuminate building walls (i.e. no up-lighting). 
b.  Supplementary yard regulations in the TCD. 
(1)  Properties within the TCD shall present an acceptable appearance to adjacent residential districts, which includes the adequate shielding of parking facilities and adequate shielding to afford protection from visual encroachment to maintain and protect the privacy of adjacent residential properties. 
c.  Landscaping percentage requirements in the TCD. 
(1)  As development and redevelopment occur within the village center and neighborhood center subdistricts, ten (10) percent of the total building site being developed or redeveloped shall be required to be landscaped. Within the village center subdistrict a parking garage with liner buildings fronting all streets and civic spaces may be exempt from this requirement. Within the village center and neighborhood center subdistricts, there shall be no landscaping percentage requirements on property between the street line and the building wall, due to the proposed location of street trees within the right-of-way and the desired close proximity of building wall to sidewalk to create traditional, walkable village and neighborhood centers. Street trees located adjacent to the lot frontage shall be counted toward the applicable tree requirements. In such case that the required number of trees cannot fit within the minimum landscaped area, remaining trees shall instead be donated to the city tree commission to be planted as public trees. 
(2)  Street trees adjacent to the lot frontage shall be provided by the applicant and shall be spaced approximately thirty (30) feet on center. 
d.  Design standards for drive-thru businesses in the TCD. 
(1)  Drive-thru service windows may be permitted only to the side or rear of the principal building, in mid-block and alley accessed locations. 
5.  Planned unit developments in the TCD. Whenever the requirements of this section are in conflict with those found in section 64-5 (planned unit developments) the regulations of this section apply. 
a.  Planned unit developments (PUD) are permitted within the TCD district provided that the PUD comply with the requirements of the specified subdistrict they are in and are developed in accordance with the TCD. Standards set forth in the TCD supersede regulations in section 64-5.B of the Code. 
6.  Off-street parking and loading. Whenever the requirements of this section are in conflict with those found in section 64-6 (off-street parking and off-street truck loading) the regulations of this section apply. 
a.  Off-street parking requirements in the TCD. The intent of these parking regulations is to encourage a balance between compact pedestrian oriented development and necessary car storage. 
(1)  Minimum amount of off-street parking facilities required. The proposed mixed-use land pattern of the TCD area fosters more pedestrian trips and fewer automobile trips than other more automobile dependant commercial districts in the city. As such, development must provide the minimum amount of parking as required for the Hank Aaron Loop, except for the following: 
General business, commercial personal service establishments, commercial amusements, offices, repair shops, medical and dental clinics, libraries, art galleries, clubs, lodges. One space per 450 square feet gross floor area. Industrial, manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution establishments One space per 450 square feet gross floor area. Office-distribution mixed use establishments. One space per 450 square feet gross floor area.  
  
(2)  Maximum amount of off-street surface parking facilities. The maximum amount of off-street surface parking provided shall be twenty (20) percent more than the prescribed minimum parking requirement amounts stated in section 64-6.A.6 of the Code for all uses excluding the Hank Aaron Loop requirements. 
(3)  Maximum amount of off-street structured parking facilities. There are no maximum parking requirements for off-street structured parking provided that spaces in excess of maximum surface parking requirements be made available to public use. 
(4)  Site design. Parking shall be located to the side or rear of the principal building. Surface parking lots shall be set back a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the property line facing a street or civic space to reserve space for either liner buildings or other screening between parking and the lot frontage. Parking lot aisles shall connect across adjacent property lines, when feasible. A property internal to a block that redevelops prior to its neighbors is not required to construct parking that connects to its neighbor's property; however, the site plan shall reflect a parking layout that provides room for future connections when neighboring properties redevelop. 
(5)  Vehicular parking access. Access to parking shall be from secondary frontages or alleys wherever possible. The vehicular entrance of a parking lot or structure shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) feet and a maximum of thirty (30) feet for two-way traffic. 
b.  Loading and service location in the TCD. In the TCD, access to loading and service entries shall be allowed only on secondary frontages (as identified on the regulating plans (see 64-3H figures 3-5), alleys, and within parking lots and structures. Loading docks, service areas and trash disposal facilities shall not face primary streets or civic spaces. For those properties with frontages only on primary streets, loading and service entries shall be permitted, but loading and service facilities shall be adequately shielded from view of pedestrians on the street or from civic spaces through use of a garden wall, fence or hedge. Shared off street loading facilities between adjoining uses and parcels is encouraged. 
7.  Signs in the TCDO. Whenever the requirements of this section are in conflict with those found in section 64-11 (sign regulation provisions) the regulations of this section apply. 
a.  Purposes. The purposes of this subsection is: to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication, while maintaining a high-quality pedestrian environment; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations. These regulations prescribe pedestrian and slow movement vehicle scaled signage that are appropriate means of communication in traditional, walkable village and neighborhood centers. Large signage meant to attract the attention of fast moving vehicles is not appropriate for such environments. 
b.  Applicability effect. A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained within the TCD, only in conformance with the standards, and requirements of this section. If any standard or regulation adopted pursuant to this section differs or conflicts with the standards prescribed by section 64-11, zoning ordinance of the city, the most restrictive standard shall apply. 
c.  Definitions and interpretation. Words and phrases used in this section shall have the meanings set forth in section 64-11.7.c. of the Code unless otherwise defined in this section. Words and phrases not defined in this section or within section 64-11.7.c. of the Code but are defined elsewhere in the zoning ordinance of the city shall be given the meanings set forth in such ordinance. All other words and phrases shall be given their common, ordinary meaning, unless the context clearly requires otherwise. Section headings or captions are for reference purposes only and shall not be used in the interpretation of this ordinance.

(4)  Build on the work of the Mobile Historic Development Commission in protecting and enhancing the historic and cultural heritage of the city's historic downtown. 
2.  Applicability. 
(a)  The DDD code applies to all properties located within the DDD (see plate A, regulating plan). 
(b)  The provisions of the DDD Code shall be the complete zoning code for the DDD. Where the DDD Code is in conflict with engineering ordinances, with the exception of the Storm Water Management and Flood Control Ordinance, the DDD Code shall govern. Where the DDD Code is silent on engineering issues, engineering ordinances shall govern. Where the DDD Code is in conflict with lot sizes allowed by the Subdivision Regulations, the DDD Code shall govern. 
(c)  Terms used throughout the DDD code shall take their commonly accepted meanings or as defined herein (the "definitions"). In the event conflicts arise between the definitions and definitions in the existing local codes, the definitions take precedence. 
(d)  The definitions contain regulatory language that is integral to the DDD code. 
3.  Establishment of sub-districts. 
(a)  The DDD is divided into the following zoning sub-districts, referred to herein as transect sub-districts, and special districts: 
(1)  T-6: a mixed-use district of high intensity. 
(2)  T-5: a mixed-use district of medium intensity. T-5 is further subdivided into T-5.1 and T-5.2 sub-districts. 
(3)  T-4: a mixed-use district of low intensity, primarily residential uses and neighborhood retail. 
(4)  T-3: a low-density residential district. 
(5)  SD-WH: a special district established to guide the redevelopment of the portion of the DDD primarily dedicated to warehousing, manufacturing and buildings of similar characteristics. 
(6)  SD: all special districts except SD-WH require a master plan be completed in coordination with the planning section. Transect sub-districts are assigned through the master plan process. Master plans shall be approved by the planning commission and the city council. 
(b)  The transect sub-districts and special district boundaries are as shown on the DDD regulating plan (see plate A). Unless otherwise noted, transect sub-district boundaries are mapped along thoroughfare centerlines, and rear property lines and side property lines. 
(c)  Regulations of subsection 64-3.I. pertaining to T-5 apply to all sub-districts of T-5. 
(d)  Planned unit development, as set forth in section 64-5 of the City Code, is not applicable within the DDD.

The number of dwelling units in a nonconforming dwelling use shall not be increased over the number of dwelling units existing in the nonconforming use on the effective date of this ordinance. 
(2)  Expansion or enlargement of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use may be expanded or enlarged only within the premises on which such nonconforming use was located on the effective date of this ordinance or on the effective date of any amendment hereto by which the use became a nonconforming use. Premises as used in this subsection shall mean the building in which the use is being carried on and the accessory buildings, appurtenances, driveways, parking and loading spaces, and the curtilage thereof. 
(3)  Abandonment of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use that has been abandoned or discontinued for a period of two (2) years shall not thereafter be re-established. 
(b)  Structures. 
(1)  Continuance of nonconforming structures. Except as hereinafter provided, any nonconforming structure may be occupied and operated and maintained in a state of good repair. 
(2)  Expansion or enlargement of nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure may be expanded or enlarged on the premises owned on the effective date of this ordinance or on the effective date of any amendment hereto by which the structure became a nonconforming structure; provided, however, that the enlargement or expansion shall conform to the requirements of the DDD code. 
(3)  Restoration of damaged nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure damaged in any manner and from any cause whatsoever may be restored, provided restoration is begun within one (1) year and completed within two (2) years of the date of the damage. The board of adjustment may grant an extension of the one-year or two-year period upon application and showing of hardship. 
(c)  Parking lots. Parking lots in existence as of the effective date of this ordinance shall conform to the requirements of 64-3.I.11(b)3 not later than November 2017. Compliance may be phased with wall or fencing to be installed by November 30, 2017. If the fence and landscaping option is chosen, required landscaping to follow within eighteen (18) months of installation of the fence. Existing evergreen vegetative buffers that accomplish the intent of 64-3.I.11(b)3 are an acceptable alternative, provided they are maintained. For properties along Broad, Beauregard, Water and Canal Streets, compliance shall coincide with the completion of physical improvements for the city projects along said streets adjacent to the property. Location of masking required by this paragraph is subject to line of sight review and approval by traffic engineering. Any parking lot that fails to timely conform shall be deemed an unlawful use and shall be discontinued. 
6.  Complete demolition permits. 
(a)  "Complete demolition," for the purposes of this section, is defined as the razing of one or more structure(s). 
(b)  Any applicant seeking a permit for complete demolition within the DDD must provide the urban development department with the following minimum information: 
(1)  The date the owner acquired the property, purchase price, and condition on date of acquisition; 
(2)  If an when the structure has been cited or received a notice of violation of the city code; 
(3)  Whether the owner has complied with or attempted to bring the building into compliance with the city's International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) and International Existing Building Code (IEBC); and if not, why? The amount of money it will cost to bring the building into minimal compliance with IPMC and/or rectify any notices of violation; 
(4)  Whether the property has been listed for sale, prices asked and offers received, if any; 
(5)  Redevelopment plans for the property in question, the amounts expended upon such plans and the dates of such expenditures; 
(6)  The opinion from a licensed structural engineer that the structure is in danger of collapse, if the applicant proposes the demolition in order to protect public health and safety; 
(7)  Any such other information as may reasonably be required by the urban development department. 
(8)  The above notwithstanding, if the applicant is able to produce substantial evidence that the structure is beyond repair and structurally unsound, the consolidated review committee may recommend approval of a permit application for demolition based on this evidence alone. 
(c)  Upon review of the above information, the urban development department may approve or deny the demolition permit based on the following criteria: 
(1)  Whether the demolition will impair the unique character of the DDD; 
(2)  Whether there are redevelopment plans for the site; 
(3)  Whether the redevelopment plans conform to the DDD code; 
(4)  Whether the demolition of the structure in question is necessary for the public health and safety due to the physical condition of the structure. 
(d)  Any applicant denied a demolition permit by operation of this Code may appeal to the board of zoning adjustment (BZA). The BZA may permit the structure to be demolished if it finds the structure is a hazard to the public health and safety due to its condition or that the enforcement of this code presents an unreasonable economic hardship on the owner. 
(1)  This exception for unreasonable economic hardship shall be applicable to owners (or the owner's assignee or lessee) of structures who have expended significant sums of money on development plans involving the demolition of such structures. 
(2)  In determining whether to grant a waiver under this exception, the BZA shall weigh the economic hardship and investment expectations of the owner (or the owner's assignee or lessee) against the potential damage to the structure and of the surrounding built environment in question. 
(3)  The mere purchase of a structure for future development without further development expenditures shall not be classified as an unreasonable economic hardship. 
(e)  An owner or authorized representative of an owner appealing to the BZA pursuant to subparagraph 64-3.I.6(d) shall submit by affidavit to the BZA at least the following: 
(1)  Replacement construction plans for the property in question and amounts expended upon such plans, including an itemization of each and every expenditure, and the dates of such expenditures. 
(2)  Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out.

Sec. 64-4. - Supplementary regulations. 
A.  Supplementary use regulations. 
1.  Areas subject to inundation. No structure shall be erected or altered where the land to be covered by such structure has been designated by the director of urban development, or his/her designee, upon advice of the city engineer, as subject to inundation, until the conditions making the land subject to inundation have been corrected. If such land is permitted to be used it shall be only upon the condition that the owners thereof and their successors in interest have by obtaining such permission, waived any claim against the city for damage caused by floodwater. 
2.  Illumination of uses. Lighting facilities used to illuminate signs, parking areas, or for other purposes shall be so arranged that the source of light does not shine directly into adjacent residence properties or into traffic. 
3.  Livestock/poultry. Livestock/poultry kept in the city are subject to the requirements of chapter 7 of the Mobile City Code and all other provisions in the zoning ordinance (zoning district, setbacks, site coverage, etc). 
B.  Supplementary area regulations. 
1.  Dwelling on small building site. Where a lot located in a residence district and on the effective date of this ordinance was lawfully existing and of record and held in separate and different ownership from any lot immediately adjoining and having continuous frontage, such lot may be used as the building site for a one-family dwelling. 
2.  Business or industry on small building site. Where a lot located in an R-B district, a B-1 district, an H-B district, a I-1 district or an I-2 district contains an area less than the required building site area for the district and on the effective date of this ordinance was existing and of record and held in separate and different ownership from any lot immediately adjoining, such lot may be used as the building site for any use permitted in the district. 
C.  Supplementary height regulations. 
1.  Height exceptions. The height limits for the various districts shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, penthouses, or domes not used for human habitation, nor to chimneys, ventilators, skylights, water tanks, parapet wells, cornices, radio and television receiving antennas, or necessary mechanical appurtenances usually carried above the roof level, provided that such features are limited to that height necessary for their proper functioning. 
2.  Excess height. 
a.  In any R-1 or R-2 district, two (2) feet, in any R-3 district, two and one-half (2.5) feet, in building height may be added above general height limits for the district for each one (1) foot of side yard provided in excess of ten (10) feet. 
b.  In any B-1 district, five (5) feet in building height may be added above general height limits for the district for each one (1) foot of side yard provided in excess of five (5) feet. 
Such additions in building height as related to side yards shall be construed to relate portions of buildings nearest to such side yards to the adjacent side yards only, except where a portion of the building is so located and of such a height as to require an increase in the other side yard to remain within a light plane established between the interior side yard line on the adjacent building site and the highest point on a building which could be erected under general height regulations for the district on the building site involved at the interior side yard line. Side yards adjacent to streets shall require such increases only where height of the affected portion of the building exceeds seventy-five (75) feet in R-1, R-2 or an I-1, or one hundred (100) feet in R-3 or B-1, and shall not require such increases in an I-2. 
3.  Compensating bulk and open space. In any R-B, B-2, B-3, B-4, H-B, I-1 or I-2 district, for the purpose of permitting variety in the shape and bulk of structures, part of a main structure may be erected or altered to a height exceeding that specified for the district in which the structure is located upon condition that a volume of space at least equal to the volume of space occupied by the part of the structure exceeding the height limit is provided and kept open below the height limit. It is intended that such open space below the height limit shall compensate for the excess bulk and the compensating open space shall be provided on the same building site. 
Such provisions shall apply within such districts except where lots in the district adjoin R-1, R-2, R-3 or B-1 districts without intervening streets or other permanent open space fifty (50) feet or more in width. In such cases, a yard equal in width to the minimum side yard in the adjoining district shall be provided, and height exceeding that permitted in the adjoining district shall be governed by regulations relating height to yard width in the adjoining district. 
D.  Supplementary yard regulations. 
1.  Protection buffer. Except as provided hereinafter, wherever the boundary of a building site in a T-B, H-B, B-1, LB-2, B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, I-1, or I-2 district, or a commercially utilized building site adjoins an R-A, R-B, R-1, R-2, or R-3 district, or a residentially utilized building site, there shall be provided on such building site a protection buffer strip not less than ten (10) feet in width. Any required yard shall be counted as part of such protection buffer strip. The protection buffer may be a wall, fence, or a screen planting strip that complies with the following regulations: 
a.  Wall or fence. If a wall or fence is provided as a protection buffer, it shall be six (6) feet high, except within any required front yard where such wall or fence shall not exceed three (3) feet in height, and of a construction and a design approved by the planning section of the urban development department.

Screen planting shall be maintained in a clean and neat condition and in such manner as to accomplish its purpose continuously. 
c.  Use of land in protection buffer strip. That part of the protection buffer strip not utilized in compliance with (a) of this section may be used only for parking or other open space uses not in conflict with the purpose of protection of the adjacent residence district or residentially utilized building site nor in violation of any other provision of this chapter. 
This requirement for a protection buffer strip may be waived by the city council in amending this chapter to create or expand a business or industry district upon a report from the Planning Commission stating that future extension of the business or industry district is anticipated and that the proposed building wall will present an acceptable appearance to the adjacent residence district. Waiver of this requirement for a protection buffer strip shall not constitute a waiver of any side yard requirement. 
d.  Responsibility for maintenance and good repair of the above requirements shall be borne by the owners of the property.

At least sixty (60) percent of this landscaping percentage requirement shall be located on the building site between the street line(s) and the building wall(s) facing the street, as illustrated in figure 1. 
(2)  Frontage tree planting requirements. The front setback must contain at least one (1) heritage tree for every thirty (30) feet of road frontage. 
(3)  Perimeter tree planting requirements. The building site must contain one (1) heritage tree or one (1) understory tree for every thirty (30) feet of the outside lot perimeter, less those heritage trees required in the front setback. As to the trees required by the preceding sentence, in no case shall more than half of such trees be understory trees. Building sites located within I-1 or I-2 zoning districts shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection. 
(4)  Tree specifications. If new trees must be planted to meet the requirements of this section, they must be a minimum of an initial diameter of three (3) inches DBH, have a warranty of at least two (2) years, and meet the species specification for a heritage tree or understory tree under this article. All such trees shall immediately become heritage trees upon planting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the urban forester determine that the number of trees required hereby, after the application of credits, is inappropriate for the site involved, he may, at his discretion, waive any number of trees required, and in such case the applicant shall instead donate the trees waived to the Mobile Tree Commission to be planted as public trees. 
b.  Parking lots. 
(1)  Parking lot requirements. Parking lot landscaping shall be provided in parking lot use areas having uncovered parking at street level. Such landscaping shall be provided in such a manner as to break up the expense of paving, facilitate the safe circulation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and provide shade valuable for pedestrians and/or vehicles. If a parking lot provides more than three hundred (300) uncovered parking spaces at street level and the public is required to park its own vehicles (self-parking), landscaping shall be provided in accordance with the circulation and parking layout requirements for off-street parking in section 64-6 of the zoning ordinance. In addition to the foregoing, parking lots must be landscaped in the interior of the lot to break up the expanse of paving. A ratio of one (1) understory tree for every twenty (20) parking spaces shall be required. Parking lots located within I-1 or I-2 zoning districts shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection. 
(2)  Landscaping design criteria. The landscape material shall be as per section 64-2, "Definitions; Landscape material" except where other landscape material or protection buffer is allowed or required in accordance with the requirements for buffer protection in section 64-4.D(1)(a) and (b) of the zoning ordinance. 
(3)  Sight visibility. Landscape material shall not obstruct visibility between the heights of three (3) and eight (8) feet above grade in vehicular use areas. There shall be an exception for existing trees as provided for in section 64-4.E.4(a). 
c.  Installation. All landscape material shall be installed in a sound workmanlike manner and in accordance with the landscape plan, as finally approved. 
d.  Maintenance. All landscaped areas shall be maintained by the owner of the property at all times. Maintenance shall include the prompt replacement of all dead or damaged landscaped material so as to ensure continued compliance with the landscaping requirements of this section. This applies to right-of-way and median maintenance for developers who elect to take credits toward landscaping requirements. Any subsequent owner of property whose predecessor in interest took credits for right-of-way and median maintenance must continue to maintain said right-of-way or median in compliance with these landscape provisions. 
e.  Irrigation. All landscaped areas shall be provided with an adequate water supply through the use of one (1) or more appropriate methods of irrigation, including hose bibbs and/or automatic or manual irrigation systems and/or any other appropriate methods. 
f.  Sight visibility. Landscape material shall not create an obstruction to visibility at intersections as required in section 64-4.D(4) of the zoning ordinance. 
g.  Protection of landscaped areas. All landscaped areas shall be protected by the use of protective tree grates, concrete curbs, wheel stops, continuous border plants of hedgerows, railroad ties, or other suitable barriers to allow sufficient percolation of water and air to the root system of living landscape material and to protect from damage due to heavy foot traffic or vehicular encroachment. 
4.  Credits toward landscaping requirements. Allocations of credits, if any, referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, and approval of plans shall be made by the inspection services department, zoning and subdivision staff. Any disagreement with the determination made by the inspection services department, zoning and subdivision staff shall be resolved by the board of zoning adjustment. 
a.  Where natural features and amenities such as trees, water courses, historic sites, and similarly irreplaceable assets exist on a building site prior to development and provision is made to preserve the aforementioned permanently, up to one hundred (100) percent may be credited toward the landscaping percentage requirement for the total building site set out in section 64-4.E.3.a., provided it is determined that such credit satisfies all purposes, objectives and requirements of this section. 
b.  Credit will be allowed toward the landscaping percentage requirements for the total building site for landscape material in adjacent rights-of-way and medians not to exceed three (3) percent of the total landscape requirements. At no time will the landscaping requirements be less than five (5) percent on the main site. Credit for right-of-way and median landscaping must be replanted as to meet all criteria in section 64-4.E. of the zoning ordinance entitled "Minimum landscaping requirements". 
Allocations of credits, if any, referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, and approval of plans shall be made by the zoning and subdivision staff. Any disagreement with the determination made by the planning commission staff shall be resolved by the City of Mobile planning commission. Total on-site landscaping requirements will not be reduced below five (5) percent except in cases of hardship, developments in historic districts or professional buildings with specific site criteria. Added credits may be issued upon documentation of the need. 
c.  Tree credit. Preservation of existing heritage trees or existing pine trees with a minimum DBH of twelve (12) inches can be credited toward the tree planting requirements of this article according to the following ratio: the number of credited trees shall be determined by measuring at a height of four and one-half (41/2) feet above grade level, the diameter (in inches) of each preserved heritage tree or pine tree and dividing the sum by six (6). To be included in the computation for credit for preserved trees, each preserved tree must be at least twelve (12) inches in diameter; however, any existing heritage tree less than twelve (12) inches in diameter by meeting the minimum tree planting size requirements of this article, may be credited for one (1) required tree. Credited trees shall be uniformly encircled by a protected ground area of sufficient size to ensure the health of the tree. During any construction on the site, the protected ground area shall be clearly marked in the field. 
No credit will be allowed for any tree proposed to be retained if there is any encroachment within the "protected ground area" defined by a circle which has as its center the trunk of the tree or the tree is unhealthy or dead. If any preserved tree being used for credit dies or fails to thrive, the owner shall plant new trees equal to the number of credited trees and the replacement trees will be of the same species or variety as the credited tree(s) lost. 
In no case shall credits for preserved trees eliminate the requirement that the front setback shall contain a ratio of at least one (1) heritage tree for every thirty (30) feet of frontage. 
5.  Landscape plan approval. A landscape plan shall be submitted for approval at the time that an application for a building permit is made on any land where the landscaping requirements of this section are applicable. Such landscape plan shall be drawn at the same scale and be provided in the same number of copies as the site plan, and shall contain the following information:

I.  Adult entertainment enterprises. 
1.  Purpose. In the development and adoption of this ordinance, it is recognized that there are some adult entertainment enterprises which due to their very nature have objectionable operational characteristics when located in close proximity to churches, schools, parks, and residential neighborhoods, thereby having a deleterious impact upon property values and the quality of life in such surrounding areas. It has been acknowledged by communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to ensure that these adverse secondary effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of adjacent neighborhoods nor endanger the well-being of the youth in their communities. The special regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable externalities arising from these enterprises are set forth below. The primary purpose of these controls and regulations is to preserve the integrity and character of residential neighborhoods, to deter the spread of urban blight and to protect minors from the objectionable operational characteristics of these adult uses by restricting their close proximity to churches, parks, schools and residential areas. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to authorize, permit, or legalize any activities otherwise prohibited by law or ordinance. 
2.  Prohibitions. 
a.  The establishment, enlargement, expansion, increase, reconstruction, resumption or structural alteration of any adult entertainment enterprise shall be prohibited if such business is within one thousand (1,000) feet of any existing church, school, park or residentially zoned (R-1, R-2, R-3) area within the City of Mobile, Mobile County, Alabama. 
b.  It shall also be prohibited to establish, enlarge, reconstruct, resume or structurally alter any adult entertainment enterprise located within two thousand (2,000) feet of any existing adult entertainment enterprise. 
3.  Measurement of distances. The distance between an adult entertainment business and any church, school, park or residentially zoned (R-1, R-2, R-3) area, shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest exterior structural wall of the adult entertainment business to the nearest property line of the church, school, park or residential area. If any adult entertainment business is part of or included within an integrated center, only the portion of said center or leased space occupied by such adult entertainment business shall be included in determining the closest exterior structural wall of said establishment. 
4.  Exterior display. No adult entertainment enterprise shall be conducted in any manner that permits the observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas by display, decorations, sign, show window or other opening from any public way. 
5.  Nonconforming uses. The lawful use of land or buildings existing at the time of the adoption and effective date of this ordinance that is in violation hereof shall be deemed a nonconforming use. In addition, said nonconforming uses shall comply with all requirements of Section VII of the City of Mobile Zoning Ordinance (Ord. 80-057) as amended. 
6.  Penalty. Notwithstanding any other provision of the zoning ordinance, any person, firm, or corporation violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this ordinance, shall be subject to a civil fine, to be assessed by the city's environmental judge, not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation. 
7.  Enforcement. The enforcement of [this] ordinance shall be enforced by the Land Use/Code Administration Department in coordination with the City of Mobile Police Department. 
8.  Appeals. Appeals of municipal court judgments and planning commission rulings issued pursuant to this ordinance shall be to the Circuit Court of Mobile County, as mandated by state law.

Sec. 64-5. - Planned unit developments. 
A.  Purposes and objectives. 
1.  Purposes. Under the regulations prescribed by this chapter for the various districts, a separate building site is required for each building other than an accessory building. For the purpose of allowing and encouraging variety of design and flexibility of location for buildings comprising a planned unit development (PUD) under this section, the requirement for a separate building site for each building is waived and the land occupied by the planned unit development is considered to be the building site for the group of buildings as a whole. 
It is the further purpose of this section to encourage the unified development of tracts of land that are suitable in size, location and character for the uses and buildings proposed. To that end, the application of the district regulations governing development on a lot-by-lot basis is modified for planned unit developments, hereinafter called PUDs, that meet the objectives and conform to the standards of this section. 
Although PUDs are most commonly multiple-family residential projects, such other building groups as shopping centers and industrial parks, as well as one-family residential projects using innovative building types and arrangements, may be designed and developed under this section. 
2.  Objectives. In pursuit of these purposes, the objectives to be met by a PUD are as follows: 
a.  Creative design. To encourage innovative and diversified design in building form and site development; 
b.  Flexibility. To permit greater flexibility in the location and arrangement of buildings and uses than is generally possible under district regulations; 
c.  Efficient land use. To encourage the most efficient and sustainable use of land, especially tracts in the inner part of the city that remain undeveloped or that are appropriate for redevelopment; 
d.  Environment. To preserve and protect as urban amenities the natural features and characteristics of the land; 
e.  Open space. To encourage the provision of common open space through efficient site design; 
f.  Public services. To encourage optimum use of available public utilities, streets and community facilities. 
3.  Applicability. A PUD shall not be required for the addition of accessory structures on commercial sites if such structures are not associated with the primary use of the property, are not occupy able or habitable, are compliant with the district regulations, do not diminish required site landscaping and trees, and do not interfere with traffic circulation on the site. 
B.  Modifications and limitations. 
1.  Modifications of district regulations. The provisions of this section are applicable in all districts. The district regulations of the district in which the PUD is located and the applicable supplementary regulations shall apply to a PUD with the following modifications: 
a.  Permitted uses. A PUD shall contain only such uses as are permitted in the district in which the PUD is located; provided, however, that in a residential PUD the planning commission may permit other uses that are permitted in B-1 and B-2 districts and that are clearly incidental to and compatible with the principal (residential) use. Business uses permitted in a residential PUD under this provision shall be limited to those which provide substantial (and not merely incidental) services to the residents of the PUD, and shall be so located that traffic, service and other aspects of their operation do not adversely affect the livability of the dwelling units. 
In permitting business uses in a residential PUD, the planning commission may stipulate that no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any business use until certificates of occupancy have been issued for all or a stated percentage of the total dwelling units contained in the PUD as approved. 
It is not the intent of this provision to permit the creation of B-1 or B-2 districts other than in accord with the amendment procedure of this chapter. 
b.  Residential building types. In R-1 districts, each town house, row house or similar building type with contiguous or party walls (attached dwellings) contained in a PUD shall meet the building site area requirement of the R-1 district for a one-family dwelling. 
In R-2 districts, each two (2) town houses, row houses or similar building type with contiguous or party walls (attached dwellings) contained in a PUD shall meet the building site area requirement of the R-2 district for a two-family dwelling. 
In R-3 and R-B districts, town houses, row houses or similar building types with contiguous or party walls (attached dwellings) contained in a PUD shall be considered to be multiple-family dwellings and shall meet the building site area requirements of the R-3 or R-B districts for multiple-family dwellings. 
In the case of a PUD which has also been approved by the planning commission as an "innovative subdivision" under the subdivision regulations, part of the required building site area for each unit may be provided in common open space and minimum yards may be varied from those required in the district in which the PUD is located. 
c.  Building site area. In a residential PUD, building site area per dwelling unit may be reduced not to exceed twenty (20) percent where common open space provided justifies such reduction by its location, character and intended use. 
d.  Yards required. Yard requirements of the district in which the PUD is located shall apply to the PUD as a whole rather than to individual buildings; provided, however, that wider or deeper yards may be required on the perimeter of the PUD site in accord with the design standards of this section. 
2.  Limitations. Planned unit developments shall be subject to following limitations: 
a.  Size of tract. The tract of land to be occupied by the PUD shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the proposed uses and buildings in a homogeneous and harmonious entity (as distinguished from typical lot-by-lot development). 
b.  Public services. No PUD shall be approved unless the planning commission determines, upon advice of the appropriate authorities, that the water, sanitary and drainage facilities, access streets and fire protection are adequate to meet the demands of the PUD. 
Provided, however, that the planning commission may approve a PUD prior to construction of such facilities, access streets and fire protection as recommended by the appropriate authorities to meet the demands of the PUD, if the planning commission specifies the completion of such recommended improvements prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy as a condition of the PUD approval. 
C.  Locational and design standards. 
1.  Locational standards. A PUD shall meet the following locational standards: 
a.  General compatibility. The tract of land to be occupied by the PUD shall be so located that the proposed uses and the site development of the PUD will be generally compatible with the uses and development of adjacent and neighboring tracts in the district. 
b.  Transportation facilities. The tract shall be so located with respect to major streets, collector streets and other transportation facilities as to have access to them without generating excessive traffic along minor streets in residential districts outside the PUD. 
c.  Environment. The tract shall be suitable for development of the proposed uses and buildings with respect to the nature of the soils and topography. Natural features of the site, such as trees, waterways, scenic and historic spots and the like, shall be preserved and protected to the greatest extent possible. 
2.  Design standards. A PUD shall meet the following design standards: 
a.  Circulation. The internal traffic circulation system shall be so designed as to discourage through traffic on minor streets both within and outside the site. Vehicular access points shall be designed to permit smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazard to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The pedestrian circulation system shall be designed to separate as completely as possible pedestrian and vehicular movement, especially in respect to the safety of pedestrian movement between dwelling units and common open space or recreation area. 
b.  Building spacing and access. In a residential PUD, the following spacing between buildings shall be measured between exterior walls; it does not apply to corner-to-corner placement of buildings where walls do not overlap: 
(1)  Spacing of buildings. A building shall be located no closer to another building than a distance equal to the height of the taller building of the two (2); provided, however, that for a two-story building such distance shall be not less than thirty (30) feet in the case of two (2) walls having windows, not less than twenty (20) feet in the case of one (1) wall having windows, and the other no windows, and not less than eight (8) feet in the case of two (2) walls having no windows; provided, further, that for buildings of more than two (2) stories spacing shall be increased proportionately. 
Variations from these spacing requirements may be made by the planning commission upon a showing that the arrangement of buildings is such that the orientation insures adequate light and air, avoids undue exposure to trafficways and the parking and service areas of commercial establishments, and preserves visual and auditory privacy between buildings. 
(2)  Access by emergency vehicles. The buildings in any PUD shall be so arranged that every building is accessible to emergency vehicles. 
c.  Common open space. In a residential PUD consisting of multiple-family dwellings at least seven hundred (700) square feet of land for each dwelling unit shall be in common open space. Common open space may contain walks, terraces, pools and the like but shall exclude streets, whether public or private, drainageways, parking areas, service areas and the land covered by buildings (except the roof areas developed for recreational use shall be considered to be common open space); provided, however, that for town houses, row houses and similar building types with contiguous or party walls (which for this section only, are considered to be multiple family dwellings) in lieu of common open space there may be provided the same amount of private open space for each dwelling unit. 
d.  Adjacent properties and uses. The design of the PUD shall consider and provide protection from adverse effects of adjacent land uses as well as protection of adjacent land uses from adverse effects of the PUD. The planning commission shall require such setbacks, screening or other measures or features necessary to accomplish this purpose. 
D.  Review procedures. 
1.  Pre-application conference. Prior to the filing of an application for approval of a planned unit development plan, hereafter referred to as the development plan, a pre-application conference may be held at the request of the applicant or the director of the urban development department or his/her agent. The purpose of the conference is to consider informally the concept of the proposed PUD, its relation to the district in which the site is located, and the way in which it will meet the objectives of this section. 
No specific documents are required for the pre-application conference, but the applicant shall be responsible for providing sufficient information on which to base tentative conclusions. 
2.  Development plan approval. A PUD may be constructed in stages, but the development plan shall include the entire tract of land. 
The director of the urban development department, or his/her agent, shall assist the applicant in preparation of a development plan by furnishing such information as requested, on land use, adjacent development and other pertinent matters as is available in the records and files of the planning commission. Where appropriate, the director, or his/her agent, shall advise the applicant to consult with those officials and agencies whose approval or advice and recommendation to the planning commission will be necessary. 
It is the intent of these regulations that when approval of a proposed PUD involves amendment of the zoning ordinance, approval of a land subdivision, or other reviews and approvals, the review and approval process be carried out as nearly concurrently as possible. To this end, if the approval of the proposed PUD requires amendment of the zoning ordinance to change the district classification of the site, application for zoning amendment shall be made in accordance with the amendment procedure of this chapter at the same time. Similarly, if the proposed PUD involves the subdivision of land (if lots or other parcels are to be sold or otherwise placed in separate ownerships, or if the PUD contains any public street), application for approval of the subdivision shall be made in accordance with the subdivision regulations at the same time. 
a.  Documentation required. The application shall contain the following: 
(1)  Interest and ownership. The applicant's name, address, interest in the application, and signature of property owners or letter of authorization; the name and address of the owner or owners of the entire land area to be included within the proposed PUD. 
(2)  Development schedule. A development schedule indicating the approximate dates when construction of the PUD (or stages of construction) can be expected to be begun and completed; and a statement as to whether the PUD will be held in one (1) ownership (individual, partnership, corporation, or other) or subdivided and sold in individual parcels of land with dwelling unit or units or other buildings. 
(3)  Quantitative data. The tract size; building site coverage; if a residential PUD, the number and type of dwelling units; the gross and net building site area per dwelling unit (density); nonresidential uses, if any, that are proposed; and the amount of common open space to be provided (in accordance with the design standards of this section). 
(4)  Agreements and covenants. A statement of the provisions of any agreements or covenants proposed to govern the use, maintenance and continued protection of the PUD and its common open space. 
(5)  Owners of surrounding property. If a public hearing is required (see b. below), a list of the names and mailing addresses of the owners of property within three hundred (300) feet from the boundaries of the site, such distance to be measured in all directions from each boundary line. Names and addresses shall be from Mobile County tax rolls. 
(6)  Site plan and supporting data. The application shall contain the following site plan and supporting data: 
(a)  Existing site conditions. The dimensions of the site; contours at two-foot intervals; the location and dimensions of easements and rights-of-way, water courses, flood plains, soil conditions and natural features of the site including heritage trees; existing land uses within the site; and any additional information necessary to indicate existing conditions that affect the proposed development. 
(b)  Site plan. The site plan, showing the area to be occupied and its approximate dimensions; the general layout of buildings and other improvements; the vehicular circulation system, including parking and loading areas; the pedestrian circulation system; the areas to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved as common open spaces, public parks, recreational areas, school sites and similar public and semi-public uses; the general landscape plan showing proposed planting and other landscape features; and the proposed perimeter treatment of the site. 
(c)  Utility systems. Existing and proposed utility systems, including water supply, sanitary sewerage, storm drainage, and electric, gas and telephone lines. (Detailed engineering plans are not required at this stage.) 
(d)  Other data. The urban development department may require such additional plans, maps, studies and reports as are needed to support the necessary findings and determinations that the applicable standards have been complied with. 
(e)  Dedication of public facilities. Approval of a development plan shall not constitute acceptance by the public of the dedication of areas intended for public use. Such acceptance can be effected only by action of the city council of the city. 
b.  Public hearing. For a PUD in which all of the proposed uses are permitted in the district in which the PUD is located, the PUD may be approved administratively, with no public hearing, as determined by the urban development department. 
For a PUD in which any of the proposed uses are not permitted uses in the district in which the PUD is located but which may be permitted by the planning commission in accordance with this section, a public hearing shall be held. In such cases the planning commission shall fix a reasonable time for the public hearing and shall give public notice thereof, as well as notice to the applicant. The commission shall also notify the owners of surrounding property, as the names and addresses of such owners have been furnished by the applicant. 
If the proposed PUD requires amendment of the zoning ordinance or approval of a subdivision preliminary plan, the required public hearings shall be held in conjunction with this public hearing. 
The planning commission shall maintain in its minutes a record of its proceedings in the case showing the grounds of its approval or disapproval. The record shall be filed in the office of the urban development department and shall be a public record. 
Substantive changes to the development plan shall be considered to be amendments to the plan and shall be subject to the same procedures specified for approval of a development plan. 
c.  Action on development plan. Within a reasonable time, the planning commission shall approve, approve with modifications and/or conditions or disapprove the development plan. If approval of the development plan stipulates modifications or conditions, such modifications or conditions shall be illustrated on the development plan prior to its submittal for permitting. 
Approval of development plan shall expire one (1) year from the date of approval if construction has not begun or an extension of such one-year period granted by the commission or the director of the urban development department, or his/her agent, in the case of an administrative approval of a development plan. 
In approving a development plan, the plan shall specify the dates by which construction of the PUD shall be begun and completed. If the PUD is proposed to be constructed in stages, the dates for beginning and completing each stage shall be specified. If the applicant does not begin and complete the construction by the dates specified, the planning commission shall review the case and may (1) upon showing of good cause by the applicant, extend the time limits, (2) revoke the approval, or (3) amend the PUD. 
d.  Filing and placing on zoning atlas. A copy of the final development plan, with attendant documentation, shall be filed with the urban development department. The PUD shall be shown on the zoning atlas by outline of the tract of land included and the notation "PUD," with the date of approval of the final development plan. The final development plan, with attendant documentation, shall thereafter be binding upon the owner, his heirs, successors and assigns, shall limit and control the issuance and validity of permits and certificates and shall restrict and limit the use and operation of all land and structures within the PUD to all conditions and limitations specified in such plan and the approval thereof.

Access, maneuvering area, ramps and other appurtenances shall be furnished off the street right-of-way and, except for one-family and two-family dwellings, vehicles are prohibited from backing from the area into the roadway. 
3.  Maintenance. Except for one-family and two-family dwellings, permitted uses in I-2 districts, and parking lots within the Hank Aaron Loop which are not paved with concrete, asphaltic concrete, or asphalt, off-street parking facilities shall be constructed, maintained and operated in accordance with the following specifications: 
a.  Drainage and surfacing. They shall be properly graded for drainage, surfaced with concrete, asphaltic concrete, asphalt or alternative parking surface as defined in section 64-2, and maintained in proper condition, free of weeds, dust, trash and debris. 
b.  Wheel stops. They shall be provided with wheel stops or bumper stops so located that no part of parked vehicles will extend beyond the parking facility. 
c.  Lighting. If they contain ten (10) or more vehicle parking spaces, parking lot lighting shall be provided and maintained during their operation, and shall be so arranged that the source of light does not shine directly into adjacent residential properties or into traffic. If they contain twenty-five (25) or more vehicle parking spaces, parking lot lighting shall be provided and maintained during their operation according to the standards in section 64-6.A.8. 
d.  Entrances and exits. They shall have entrances and exits provided and located so as to minimize traffic congestion and to prevent vehicles backing from the area into the roadway. 
e.  Prohibition of other uses. They shall not be used for the sale, repair, dismantling, or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials, or supplies. 
f.  Limitation on size of vehicles. In the residence districts they shall be used only by vehicles up to eight thousand (8,000) pounds' gross vehicle weight, manufacturer's capacity rating and having wheels not to exceed seventeen (17) inches in diameter. 
g.  Pedestrian safety aisles. They shall have provided a four-foot-wide clearance between abutting rows of parking spaces for pedestrian safety aisles, and such pedestrian safety aisles shall be maintained by wheel stops, shall be paved, shall be maintained free of standing water, and shall be located with alternate parking groups, a parking group being two (2) rows of side-by-side parking spaces abutting; provided, however, that no safety aisle shall be required of those parking facilities in which cars are parked by attendants. 
Such pedestrian safety aisles shall be marked at not more than fifty-foot intervals by signs at least six (6) feet above ground with at least one (1) square foot of area, with the words "Pedestrian Walk." 
h.  Circulation and parking layout. If total spaces are more than three hundred (300) and the public is required to park its own vehicles (self-parking), there shall be established blocks of parking spaces containing not more than three hundred (300) parking spaces per block, and the limits of such blocks shall be defined by fifteen-foot-wide raised planting strips with curbs. Such a planting strip which lies parallel to a group of parking spaces shall have a four-foot-wide paved pedestrian walk extending the entire length of such strip. Also, a planting strip shall be maintained along the side of a "block feeder roadway" at the head of and for the full width of a group of parking spaces which has a pedestrian safety aisle. Neither shall a parking group which does not contain a pedestrian safety aisle exceed three hundred (300) feet in length without a vehicular connection between adjoining "group feeder roadways." 
Roadways within parking facilities composed of blocks of parking spaces shall have a minimum width of twenty-four (24) feet with the following exceptions: a "block feeder roadway" which feeds vehicles into blocks of parking stalls lying along both sides of such roadway shall have a minimum width of thirty-six (36) feet; a "store roadway" which runs parallel to fronts of stores shall have a minimum width of thirty-six (36) feet; a "group feeder roadway" which gives access to individual parking spaces shall have a minimum width as required by the standards listed in the above table of stall and aisle dimensions; a "major roadway" which provides major circulation within a parking facility shall have a minimum width of thirty-six (36) or forty-eight (48) feet as required by the volume of traffic. 
Off-street parking facilities composed of blocks of parking spaces shall have parking spaces accessible from a "group feeder roadway" and from no other type roadway. 
i.  Screening and landscaping. If off-street parking facilities provide uncovered spaces for ten (10) or more cars at street level, they shall be permanently screened from adjacent R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts in accordance with the requirements for buffer planting strips in section 64-4. Where such facilities are separated from an R-1, R-2 or R-3 district only by a street, other than a major street as shown on the major street plan, they shall have a brick wall or evergreen hedge of a minimum height of five and one-half (51/2) feet and a maximum of eight (8) feet placed five (5) feet inside the street property line. The area between the screening enclosure and the property line shall be landscaped. 
Planting strips, other than buffer planting strips required by section 64-4, shall have trees planted on maximum seventy-five-foot centers. Any part of the parking facility not used for parking stalls, roadways or pedestrian walks shall be landscaped with grass, shrubs and trees. 
Within parking areas, tree limbs and other planting shall not create a material impediment to visibility between the heights of three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above the parking area grade. 
One (1) sign not more than two (2) square feet in area will be permitted on each street side of such parking facility, but no other signs shall be placed on the screening or brick wall. 
4.  Gravel parking lots within the Hank Aaron Loop-Maintenance. Gravel parking lots within the Hank Aaron Loop may be constructed, maintained and operated in accordance with the following specifications, and approved by the planning commission via a planning approval application; otherwise, parking lots within the Hank Aaron Loop must comply with subsection 64-6.A.3, above: 
a.  Prohibition. Gravel parking lots are prohibited as commercial parking lot. 
b.  Drainage and surfacing. They shall be properly graded for drainage, surfaced with gravel and maintained in proper condition, free of weeds, trash and debris and contained within concrete curbing with a city standard curb cut and concrete apron; 
c.  Wheel stops. They shall be provided with wheel stops or bumper stops so located as to delineate each parking space, so located that no part of parked vehicles will extend beyond the parking facility, parking stall dimensions as well as access and maneuvering areas must comply with the minimum stall and aisle dimensions as established in section 6.A.; 
d.  Screening and landscaping. The entire parking area shall be screened, with a minimum three-foot tall evergreen hedge, at the time of planting. 
5.  Combined facilities. The off-street parking facilities required of two (2) or more uses located on the same building site may be combined and used jointly; provided, however, that where the facilities are combined and used jointly by two (2) or more uses having different standards for determining the amount of facilities required, the off-street parking facilities shall be adequate in area to provide the sum total of the facilities required of all such uses. 
6.  Amounts of off-street parking facilities required. Except for permitted uses in I-2 districts, at the least the following amounts of off-street parking facilities shall be provided. The classifications of uses shall be deemed to include and apply to all uses, and if the classifications of an use for the purpose of determining the amount of off-street parking facilities to be provided is not readily determinable hereunder, the classification of the use shall be fixed by the board of adjustment.

a.  Limitations on separation from use. In B-4 districts and R-B districts off-street parking facilities may be located on a separate site from the building site on which the use is located, provided such separate site is no farther from the building site of the use for which provided than one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet in the case of a B-4 district or five hundred (500) feet in the case of an R-B district; all such distances shall be measured along the most direct line of walking along public streets from the nearest point of the separated off-street parking facilities. No such separated parking facilities shall be located within an R-1, R-2, or R-3 district, and no such separated parking facilities shall be located within an R-B district except those required for uses in the district. 
b.  Limitations on sharing facilities. No use shall be considered as individually having provided off-street parking facilities which are shared with one (1) or more other uses unless the schedules of operation of all such uses are such that none of the uses sharing the facilities require the off-street parking facilities at the same time as any other uses sharing them. 
c.  Application for approval of special plan. An application for approval of a special plan hereunder shall be filed with the municipal building inspector by the owner or owners of all structures then existing on such land area, and, additionally, shall contain sufficient evidence to establish that the applicants have the right of possession to the land area and structures. The application shall contain such information required by this ordinance or deemed necessary by the inspection services department and shall include plans showing the location of the uses or structures for which off-street parking facilities are required and the location at which the off-street parking facilities are proposed to be located. 
d.  Review of applications. Applications hereunder shall be reviewed by the inspection services department and either approved or disapproved within thirty (30) days; and approval may establish conditions and limitation. 
e.  Filing of special plan. Upon approval of a special plan, a copy of such plan shall be filed among the records of the inspection services department and shall thereafter be binding upon the applicants, their heirs, successors and assigns, shall limit and control the issuance and validity of permits and certificates and shall restrict and limit the use and operation of all land and structures included within such special plans to all conditions and limitations specified in such plans and the approvals thereof. 
f.  Amendment or withdrawal of special plan.

The letter shall specify fixtures, wattages, pole heights, and any special requirements such as rotation, angle, shielding or positioning of critical poles at property lines. 
B.  Off-street loading facilities. 
1.  Provisions and maintenance required. The off-street truck loading facilities herein required are provided in at least the amount and maintained in the manner herein set forth; provided, however, that off-street truck loading facilities in excess of the amounts heretofore required by law need be neither provided nor maintained for structures actually used, occupied, and operated on the effective date of this ordinance unless, after the effective date of this ordinance, such structures are enlarged or expanded, in which event the structures hereby excluded shall not be used, occupied, or operated unless there is provided for the increment only of such structures, and maintained as herein required, at least the amount of off-street truck loading facilities that would be required hereunder if the increment were a separate structure. 
2.  Size and location. For the purpose of this chapter there shall be considered to be two (2) sizes of off-street truck loading spaces, "large" and "small": Each "large" space shall have an overhead clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet, shall be at least twelve (12) feet wide, and shall be at least fifty (50) feet long exclusive of access or maneuvering area, platform, and other appurtenances; each "small" space shall have an overhead clearance of at least ten (10) feet, shall be at least ten (10) feet wide, and shall be at least twenty (20) feet long, exclusive of access or maneuvering area, platform, and other appurtenances. Off-street truck loading facilities shall be located on the same building site on which the structure for which they are provided is located; provided, however, that facilities provided under a cooperative arrangement as hereinafter permitted may be located on another site not more than three hundred (300) feet from the structure for which they are provided. Access, maneuvering area, ramps and other appurtenances shall be furnished off the street right-of-way and so arranged that vehicles are not required to back from the street into the area, nor required to back from the area into the street. 
3.  Maintenance. Off-street truck loading facilities shall be constructed, maintained, and operated in accordance with the following specifications: 
a.  Drainage and surfacing. They shall be properly graded for drainage, surfaced with concrete, asphaltic concrete, or asphalt and maintained in good condition, free of weeds, dust, trash, and debris. 
b.  Lighting. Lighting facilities shall be so arranged that the source of light does not shine directly into adjacent residential properties or into traffic. 
c.  Entrance and exits. They shall be provided with entrances and exits so located as to minimize traffic congestion or backing from the street into the area. 
d.  Circulation. Where access and drives to off-street loading facilities occur in conjunction with off-street parking facilities that provide parking at street level for more than six hundred (600) cars provision shall be made to maintain separate circulation routes within such facilities. 
4.  Cooperative establishment and use of facilities. Requirements for the provision of off-street truck loading facilities with respect to two (2) or more structures may be satisfied by the permanent allocation of the requisite number of spaces for each use in a common truck loading facility, cooperatively established and operated; provided, however, that the total number of spaces designated is not less than the sum of the individual requirements unless, in the opinion of the inspection services department, a lesser number of spaces will be adequate, taking into account the respective times of usage of the truck loading facilities by the individual users, the character of the merchandise, and related factors. In order to eliminate a multiplicity of individual facilities, to conserve space where space is at a premium, and to promote orderly development generally, the inspection services department is hereby authorized to plan and group off-street truck loading facilities cooperatively for a number of truck loading generators within close proximity to one another in a given area, and especially in the general business districts, in such manner as to obtain a maximum of efficiency and capacity, provided consent thereto is obtained from the participants in the cooperative plan.

a.  Change in use . A change of use is when a structure's primary function changes to another use as listed in the Chart of Permitted Uses. Such changes may result in a change in site requirements such as parking, the provision of protection buffers, etc. A change in use is not necessarily a change in occupancy as defined by the City of Mobile Building Code. 
b.  Structures. Application for a certificate of occupancy for a new structure or for an existing structure to be altered shall be made coincident with the application for a building permit, after erection or alteration of such structure shall have been completed in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and compliance has been confirmed, and written request is made to the Urban Development department, the certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the department provided the Planning Section has confirmed that such use or structure is in compliance with this chapter. 
c.  Land. Application for a certificate of occupancy for the use of vacant land or for a change in the character of the use of land shall be made before any such land is occupied or used, and a certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the Urban Development department if such proposed use or change in use has been confirmed by the Planning Section to be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
d.  Farming, truck gardening and livestock raising. The use of land for farming, truck gardening and livestock raising and the erection and alteration of structures, except dwellings, that are accessory to such use of the land are exempt from the requirements of a certificate of occupancy, provided that the Planning Section has confirmed that the land and such structures (except dwelling) may be used for farming, truck gardening or livestock raising, as the case may be, in compliance with this chapter. 
3.  Plans required. Unless furnished with the application for a building permit, each application to the department for a certificate of occupancy shall be accompanied by a drawing or plat, in duplicate, showing the site plan, the location of the building on the site, accurate dimensions of the building and site, location of off-street parking and off-street loading spaces required and such other information as may be necessary for the enforcement of these regulations. 
4.  Construction begun or authorized prior to effective date of ordinance. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans, construction, or designated use of a structure, the construction of which shall have legally and actually begun prior to July 23, 1991, as hereby amended, or, if a building permit shall have been required and issued for such structure and construction has begun within ninety (90) days of the day of such permit, or, if the board of adjustment shall have granted a variance therefor, and which entire structure shall have been completed within two (2) years after July 23, 1991; as hereby further provided, however, that within thirty (30) days after July 23, 1991, as hereby amended, the owner of both the land on which the structure is being constructed and the structure itself shall file with the urban development department a statement giving such information as would ordinarily be required by the application for a certificate of occupancy.

A.  Amendment policy. 
1.  Reason for amendment. This chapter, including the zoning map, is based on comprehensive planning studies and is intended to carry out the objective of a sound, stable and desirable development. It is recognized that casual change or amendment to the chapter would be detrimental to the achievement of that objective, and it is therefore declared to be the public policy to amend this chapter only when one or more of the following conditions prevail: 
a.  Error. There is a manifest error in the chapter; 
b.  Change in conditions. Changed or changing conditions in a particular area, or in the planning region generally, make a change in the chapter necessary and desirable; 
c.  Increase in need for sites for business or industry. Increased or increasing needs for business or industrial sites, in addition to sites that are available, make it necessary and desirable to rezone an area or to extend the boundaries of an existing district; 
d.  Subdivision of land. The subdivision or imminent subdivision of land into urban building sites makes reclassification necessary and desirable. 
2.  Sizes of new districts. There are no minimum sizes for new districts created by amendment of this chapter; provided, however, that the minimum sizes set out below shall serve as general guides. New districts of smaller size may be created where unusual conditions or circumstances justify them in the opinion of the planning commission. 
a.  R-2, R-3, R-B, B-3, B-4, H-B, I-1, and I-2 districts. A proposed new R-2, R-3, R-B, B-3, B-4, H-B, I-1, or I-2 district should contain at least four (4) acres of gross area; provided, however, that a proposed R-3 or R-B district which would abut an existing B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, I-1, or I-2 district, a proposed B-3 district which would abut an existing B-4, H-B, I-1 or I-2 district, a proposed B-4 district that would abut an existing I-1 or I-2 district, and a proposed I-1 district which would abut an existing I-2 district shall be exempt from this guideline. 
b.  B-1 and B-2 districts. A proposed new B-1 or B-2 district should contain at least two (2) acres of gross area; provided, however, that a proposed B-1 district which would abut an existing B-2, B-3, B-4, I-1 or I-2 district and a proposed B-2 district which would abut an existing B-3 or B-4 district shall be exempt from this guideline. 
c.  R-1 districts. There is no requirement of minimum size for new R-1 districts. 
B.  Amendment procedure. 
1.  By whom initiated. Amendments to this chapter may be initiated by the city council on its own motion or by the planning commission; amendments may also be initiated by any person, firm or corporation by filing a written application therefor with the planning commission.

c.  Development schedule. The time schedule for the beginning and completion of development planned by the applicant in the area, if the development is planned in stages, the time schedule shall indicate the successive stages and the development planned for each stage. 
d.  Effect of amendment. A report giving the nature, description, and effect of the proposed amendment; if the proposed amendment would require a change in the zoning map, a description of the probable effect on the surrounding land uses and properties. 
e.  Error. The error in this chapter that would be corrected by the proposed amendment, if the intent is to correct an error. 
f.  Owners of surrounding property. If the proposed amendment would require a change in the zoning map, furnish the commission with the name, description of property owned and mailing address of each owner of property which either abuts or lies within three hundred (300) feet of the property the classification of which is sought to be changed. 
3.  Administrative examination. Upon receipt of an application for amendment, properly and completely made out, the planning commission shall examine the application and shall make such investigation as is necessary. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of an application the zoning administrator shall transmit the application, together with its report and recommendation, to the planning commission. 
4.  Planning disposition. Following receipt of an application, or upon initiation of an amendment by the planning commission or the city council, the planning commission shall fix a reasonable time for a public hearing and shall give notice to the applicant. If it deems necessary, the planning commission may also notify the owners of surrounding property by mail (as the names and addresses of such owners have been furnished by the applicant) and may post a notice of such hearing on the property included within the proposed district. 
Where a proposed amendment is initiated by the city council or the planning commission and where such proposed amendment would change the text of the zoning ordinance or would affect a general or substantial change in the districts set out on the zoning map, the requirement for notification of the owners of the surrounding property, as well as notification of the owners of any subject property involved in the proposed amendment, may be waived by the planning commission; provided, however, that if such notification is waived, the planning commission shall give public notice of its public hearing on the proposed amendment as required by law for a public hearing by the city council for an amendment to the zoning chapter. 
5.  Public hearing. The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on every proposed amendment whether of the text of this chapter or the zoning map.

6.  Legislative disposition. The city council shall examine all such applications and reports submitted to it and shall take such further action as it deems necessary and desirable. The city council in its discretion may determine whether to hold a public hearing on the application, and if the city council determines not to hold a public hearing or takes no action within thirty (30) days after the application and report are received by the city clerk from the planning commission the application shall be deemed denied. If the city council determines to hold a public hearing on the application, the city clerk shall notify the applicant of the time and place and shall give public notice thereof as required by law. No amendment, whether amending the text of the chapter or the zoning map, shall be enacted unless such public hearing has been held. 
a.  Conditions. If an application for an amendment to the zoning map contains representations that a specified area will be developed in accordance with a given plan and time schedule, and if the area is rezoned substantially as proposed in the application, the city council shall fix conditions in the amendment so as to require performance of the development in accordance with such plan and time schedule. Such conditions, among other things, shall provide that, upon a failure to develop the area within the specified time and in accordance with the conditions fixed, no permit for the construction of any structures within the area shall be issued until the area has been examined and zoned or rezoned for its most appropriate use; provided, however, that the time set for beginning construction shall not be less than twelve (12) months. Conditions fixed in amendments relating to rezoning shall run with the land in the area involved and shall be binding upon applicants for amendments, their heirs, successors and assigns. 
b.  Reconsideration. No land for which an application for reclassification has been denied by the city council shall be considered again by the planning commission or the city council for the same classification for at least six (6) months from the date such application was denied.
