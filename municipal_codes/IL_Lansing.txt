PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Lansing, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 and 1982 Codes, as supplemented through January 2008, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Village Board of Trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Lansing Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra Fox, Code Attorney, and Daryl Jaquette, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Jean Eisha, Village Clerk, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Village's affairs.

(b)  Scope. This policy includes all funds governed by the board of trustees. 
(c)  Prudence. 
(1)  Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the probable income to be derived. 
(2)  The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio.

(1)  Legality. Conformance with federal, state and other legal requirements. 
(2)  Safety. The preservation of capital and the protection of investment principal.

(e)  Delegation of authority. Management and administrative responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to the village treasurer, who under the delegation of the board of trustees shall establish written procedures for the investment program's operation. 
(f)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the investment program's proper execution and management, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. 
(g)  Authorized financial dealers and institutions. 
(1)  The village treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services. 
(2)  In addition, a list will also be maintained of approved security brokers/dealers selected by credit worthiness.

(j)  Safekeeping and custody. All security transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the village shall be conducted on a delivery-verses-payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held by an independent third-party custodian designated by the village treasurer and evidenced by safekeeping receipts and a written custodian agreement. 
(k)  Diversification. The entity shall diversify its investments to the best of its ability based on the type of funds invested and the cash flow needs of those funds. Diversification can be accomplished by any of the following:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 13-08, adopted Feb. 19, 2013, repealed art. XVII, § 2-529, and enacted a new art. XVII as set out herein. The former art. XVII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 04-017, § 1, adopted May 18, 2004.

For example, an advertisement in a newspaper, church bulletin, or direct-mail piece is not "actively pursuing an opportunity to establish an economic relationship" under this policy. Providing an estimate of costs for services, price list or rate to an individual is "actively pursuing an opportunity to establish an economic relationship." If the individual then engages the services or places an order, an economic relationship is created. If the individual expressly declines the offer, and the village official takes no further action, the village official is no longer "actively pursuing an opportunity to establish an economic relationship" with the individual. If the individual expressly declines the offer and the village official submits a new offer, the village official is "actively pursuing an opportunity to establish an economic relationship" with the individual.

This shall include any transaction or dealing of any kind or nature with a petitioner, where the value of the goods, service or other benefit exchanged exceeds $150.00. However, in no event shall the term economic relationship be deemed to include a transaction in which the village official is the consumer of a good (for example, clothing purchased from a merchant) or service (for example, dinner at a restaurant or the procurement of medical services), where the consumption of the good or service occurs in the ordinary course of the petitioner's business and the price of the good or service is fixed by the merchant or service provider and is no different from that which is offered to the general public.

c.  If any consultant or any employee other than the village administrator, assistant village administrator or finance director develops a conflict of interest and may reasonably be expected to advise or participate in the discussion of the issue that is the subject of the conflict, that person shall: 
1.  Make full written disclosure to the village clerk or make public disclosure of the conflict at an open meeting; and 
2.  Abide by any prohibitions or restrictions issued by either the corporate authorities or village administrator, with respect to participation in the resolution of the issue that is the subject of the conflict.

This can include reassignment or, if necessary, termination of employment for one or both of the individuals involved.

(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of the written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said interest to the village; provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become village property to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation; provided, that, any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other village rights, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed upon or otherwise violated.

The applicant must notify the village in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with the revised application. Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application cure does not apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. 
e.  Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after approval of an application for a permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant shall enter into a master pole attachment agreement, provided by the village for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole by the applicant. For subsequent approved permits to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant shall enter into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement. The director of the department of building shall be authorized to execute the foregoing agreements without further approval by the corporate authorities of the village. Said execution by the director shall be deemed to constitute the approval of the respective agreement by the corporate authorities. 
(3)  Completeness of application. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the village shall determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the village must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed complete if the village fails to provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in the village's permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the village. 
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information. 
(4)  Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by: 
a.  An express written agreement by both the applicant and the village; or 
b.  A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes the delay. 
(5)  Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application. 
(6)  Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter. If the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable village code provisions or regulations in effect at the time of renewal. 
(7)  Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information and notices to the village at the village hall by personal delivery or by certified mail. 
(c)  Collocation requirements and conditions. 
(1)  Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
(2)  Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
(3)  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous sentence. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
(4)  The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. For purposes of this subsection, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(5)  The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(6)  The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment, and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a village ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive plan, or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. At a minimum, a wireless provider shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  Small wireless facilities mounted at grade. In the event that the wireless provider proposes to install a facility where equipment or appurtenances are to be installed at grade, screening must be installed to minimize the visibility of the facility. Screening must be installed at least three feet from the equipment installed at-grade and eight feet from a roadway. 
b.  Color. The small wireless facility, including all related equipment and appurtenances, must be a color that blends with the surroundings of the pole, structure tower or infrastructure on which it is mounted and use non-reflective materials which blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and structures. Any wiring must be covered with an appropriate cover. 
c.  Antenna panel covering. A small wireless facility antenna may include a radome, cap or other antenna panel covering or shield, to the extent such covering would not result in a larger or more noticeable facility and, if proposed, such covering must be of a color that blends with the color of the pole, structure, tower or infrastructure on which it is mounted. 
d.  Wiring and cabling. Wires and cables connecting the antenna to the remainder of the facility must be installed in accordance with the electrical code currently in effect in the village. No wiring and cabling serving the facility will be allowed to interfere with any wiring or cabling installed by a cable television or video service operator, electric utility or telephone utility. 
e.  Grounding. The small wireless facility must be grounded in accordance with the requirements of the electrical code currently in effect in the village. 
f.  Guy wires. No guy or other support wires will be used in connection with a small wireless facility unless the facility is to be attached to an existing utility pole, wireless support structure, or village-owned infrastructure that incorporated guy wires prior to the date that an applicant has applied for a permit. 
g.  Pole extensions. Extensions to utility poles, wireless support structures, and village-owned infrastructure utilized for the purpose of connecting a small wireless facility antenna and its related small wireless facility equipment must have a degree of strength capable of supporting the antenna and any related appurtenances and cabling and capable of withstanding wind forces and ice loads in accordance with the applicable structural integrity standards, as set forth in the subsection entitled structural integrity. An extension must be securely bound to the utility pole, wireless support structure, or village-owned infrastructure in accordance with applicable engineering standards for the design and attachment of such extensions. 
h.  Structural integrity. The small wireless facility, including the antenna, pole extension and all related equipment must be designed to withstand a wind force and ice loads in accordance with applicable standards established in chapter 25 of the National Electric Safety Code for utility poles, Rule 250-B and 250-C standards governing wind, ice, and loading forces on utility poles, in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in TIA/EIA Section 222-G established by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the Electronics Industry Association (EIA) for steel wireless support structures and the applicable industry standard for other existing structures. For any facility attached to village-owned infrastructure or, in the discretion of the village, for a utility pole or wireless support structure, the operator of the facility must provide the village with a structural evaluation of each specific location containing a recommendation that the proposed installation passes the standards described above. The evaluation must be prepared by a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of Illinois. 
i.  Signage. Other than signs required by federal law or regulations or identification and location markings, installation of signs on a small wireless facility is prohibited. 
j.  Screening. If screening is required under subsection (6)a., it must be natural landscaping material or a fence subject to the approval of the village and must comply with all other regulations of the village. Appropriate landscaping must be located and maintained and must provide the maximum achievable screening, as determined by the village, from view of adjoining properties and public or private streets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such screening is required to extend more than nine feet in height. Landscape screening when permitted in the right-of-way must be provided with a clearance of three feet in all directions from the facility. The color of housing for ground-mounted equipment must blend with the surroundings. For a covered structure, the maximum reasonably achievable screening must be provided between such facility and the view from adjoining properties and public or private streets. In lieu of the operator installing the screening, the village, at its sole discretion, may accept a fee from the operator of the facility for the acquisition, installation, or maintenance of landscaping material by the village. 
(7)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide a written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this subsection. 
(8)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
a.  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
b.  Forty-five feet above ground level. 
(9)  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height in excess of the above height limitations for a new or replacement pole on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for such applicable relief in conformance with the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the applicable section or sections of this Code. 
(10)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(11)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
(12)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
(13)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in writing to the applicant. 
(d)  Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows: 
(1)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650.00 for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350.00 for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures. 
(2)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000.00 for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable. 
(4)  The village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for: 
a.  Routine maintenance; 
b.  The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the village at least ten days prior to the planned replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment consistent with the requirements of subsection d. under the section titled "application requirements"; or 
c.  The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes. 
(5)  Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to work within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures. 
(e)  Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a person to collocate small wireless facilities on: 
(1)  Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by the village or another unit of local government that is not located within rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure without the consent of the property owner; 
(2)  Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or 
(3)  Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed, and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act. For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement to obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer cable service or video service or to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject to this chapter. 
(f)  Pre-existing agreements. Existing agreements between the village and wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small wireless facilities collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter. A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the village on the June 1, 2018 may accept the rates, fees and terms that the village makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two or more years after June 1, 2018 by notifying the village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this subsection. 
(g)  Annual recurring rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the village an annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals (1) $200.00 per year or (2) the actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the village utility pole. If the village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the rate shall be $200.00 payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter. 
(h)  Abandonment. 
(1)  A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt of written notice from the village notifying the owner of the abandonment. The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the owner. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery. 
(2)  A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities subject to this chapter within the jurisdictional boundary of the village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless provider.

(Ord. No. 18-029, § 3, 9-4-2018) 
Sec. 32-304. - Indemnification. 
    A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the village harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability. 
(Ord. No. 18-029, § 3, 9-4-2018) 
Sec. 32-305. - Insurance. 
(a)  A wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance: 
(1)  Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all risks; 
(2)  Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or 
(3)  Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities on the village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection limits consistent with the village's requirements of other users of village improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage. The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. 
(b)  A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by the village. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limits required by the village. 
(Ord. No. 18-029, § 3, 9-4-2018) 
Sec. 32-306. - Severability. 
    If any provision of this chapter or application thereof to any person or circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be given effect without the invalid application or provision, and each invalid provision or invalid application of this chapter is severable.

(b)  In the event the board or the agency determines that grounds for revocation exist or have existed, the board or agency shall notify a grantee, in writing, setting forth the nature and facts of such noncompliance. If, within 30 days following such written notification, the grantee has not furnished reasonable evidence that corrective action has been initiated, taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, or evidence that the alleged violations did not occur, or that the alleged violations were beyond the grantee's control, the agency shall thereupon refer the matter to the board.

Further, the inability of a grantee to obtain financing, for whatever reason, shall not be an act or omission which is beyond the grantee's control. 
(f)  In the event that a franchise has been revoked by the board, the board shall have an option, to the extent then permitted by existing law, to either purchase the assets of the grantee's CATV system previously governed by the franchise at reproduction cost, less depreciation, or assign such rights to purchase such assets at their fair market value. Such an option must be exercised within one year from the date of the franchise's revocation, or the entry of the final judgment by a court reviewing the question of the board's revocation, or the entry of a final order upon appeal of same, whichever is later. 
(g)  The termination of a grantee's rights under a franchise shall in no way affect any other rights the village may have under the franchise or under any provision of law.

(2)  Property damage insurance indemnifying, defending, and saving harmless the village, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for property damage occasioned by the operation of grantee under the franchise herein granted, or alleged to have been so caused or occurred, with a minimum liability of $500,000.00 for property damage to property of any one person. 
(3)  A performance bond running to the village with good and sufficient surety approved by the village in the amount specified in the franchise, or if no amount is specified therein, in the sum of $200,000.00, conditioned upon the faithful performance and discharge of the obligations imposed by this article and the franchise awarded hereunder from the date thereof including, but not limited to, the faithful compliance with the construction timetable proposed by the grantee in its application as incorporated into the franchise, unless appropriate extension is approved by the board. When regular subscriber service is available to more than 90 percent of the occupied dwelling units within the primary service area, as described in section 36-41, as certified by the agency to the board, the amount of the bond shall be reduced to the amount specified in the franchise, or if no amount is specified therein, to the sum of $50,000.00. The village's right to recover under the bond shall be in addition to any other rights retained by the village under this article and other applicable law. Any proceeds recovered under the bond may be used to reimburse the village for the loss of expected payments of the franchise fee and other valuable consideration given for the grant of the franchise, and such additional expenses as may be incurred by the village as a result of grantee's failure to comply with the obligations imposed by this article and the franchise including, but not limited to:

(c)  The grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold harmless the village, its officials, boards, commission, agents and employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments for damage arising out of the operation of the CATV system under the franchise. These damages shall include, but not be limited to, penalties arising out of copyright infringements and damages arising out of any failure by the grantee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by the grantee's CATV system whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by the franchise. Indemnified expenses shall include, but is not be limited to, all out-of-pocket expenses, such as attorney's fees, and shall also include the reasonable value of any services rendered by the village attorney or his assistants or any employees of the village. 
(d)  In addition to the bond required in subsection (b) of this section, the grantee shall maintain at its own expense, and by its acceptance of a franchise be deemed to have agreed that it will maintain on deposit with the village throughout the term of such franchise a cash escrow or a letter of credit from a state financial institution in the amount of $10,000.00 or such greater or lesser amount as may be specified in the franchise. The form and content of such escrow or letter of credit shall be approved by the village attorney. The escrow or letter of credit shall be conditioned in the same manner as the bond required in subsection (b) of this section and may be drawn on by the village to compensate itself for any of the damages or costs incurred. In particular, but without limitation, such escrow or letter of credit shall be drawn on in the case of any default or failure of the grantee to pay any fees, penalties, claims, liens or taxes due the village under this article or the franchise. Upon drawing on such escrow or letter of credit for any reason, the village shall notify the grantee. The grantee shall, within three days of the receipt of such notification, take all action required to restore the escrow or letter of credit to its original full amount. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the escrow or letter of credit are in addition to all other village rights, whether reserved by this article or the franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such escrow or letter of credit shall affect any other right the village may have.

(c)  No such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, except when such hypothecation shall exceed 75 percent of the fair market value of the property used by the grantee in the operation of its CATV system. Prior consent of the board, expressed by resolution, shall be required for such transfer and said consent shall not be withheld unreasonably. 
(d)  Prior approval of the board shall be required where ownership or control of more than 20 percent of the right of control of the grantee is acquired in any transaction or series of transactions by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own or control 20 percent or more of such right of control, singularly or collectively. By its acceptance of this franchise, the grantee specifically grants and agrees that any such acquisition occurring without prior approval of the board shall constitute a violation of this article by the grantee. 
(e)  The board's consent to any sale, transfer, lease, trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the village's rights under this article and the franchise. 
(f)  Notwithstanding any other terms or provisions of this article, the grantee shall have the right to assign, transfer, sell or dispose of, in whole or in part, by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise, ordinance or the CATV system to a wholly owned subsidiary or an affiliated interest without the prior consent of the board, agency or the village, provided that the parent company remains fully liable for the terms and conditions of this agreement.

(a)  By accepting a franchise granted pursuant to the terms and conditions imposed by this article, the grantee agrees that the board shall have the authority and right to cause the grantee's fees for regular subscriber service, and all other services to the extent permitted by law of FCC rules and regulations, to conform to the provisions contained herein. The board shall also have the authority and right to deny increases or order reduction of fees when it determines that in the absence of such action on its part, the grantee's fees or proposed fees do not conform to the stipulations contained herein.

If, during the term of the franchise, the grantee receives refunds of any copyright payments caused by an error in copyright fee computations which results in an overcharge to subscribers, it shall without delay notify the board, suggest a plan for flow-through of the refunds to its subscribers, and retain such refunds in an interest bearing escrow account pending order of the board. After considering the plan submitted by the grantee, the board shall order flow-through of the refunds with accrued interest to the grantee's subscribers in a fair and equitable manner. 
(e)  By acceptance of a franchise, the grantee further acknowledges that the village retains the right to fix rates for regular subscriber service, and all other services to the extent permitted by law or FCC rules and regulations, that are just, reasonable and compensatory. Any time after 30 months from the date service is provided to the first subscriber under the franchise, the board, after proper notice as provided in section 36-25, may hold public hearings to consider the necessity of regulating the regular subscriber rates charged by the grantee, and by reasonable amendment of the chapter and franchise, and/or by adoption of rules and regulations, may establish procedures for the review of regular subscriber rates; provided, however, that this section shall not permit the village to order the grantee to rebate any fee or portion thereof charged during the period when such fees were not subject to regulation by the village. 
(f)  The grantee shall be required to apprise in writing each new subscriber of all applicable fees and charges for providing CATV service. 
(g)  The grantee may, at its own discretion, waive, reduce or suspend connection fees for specific or indeterminate periods and/or monthly service fees for periods not to exceed 60 days for promotional purposes. 
(h)  Except as may be otherwise provided in a franchise, a subscriber shall have the right to have its service disconnected without charge; such disconnection shall be made as soon as practicable and in no case later than 30 days following notice to the grantee of same. No grantee shall enter into any agreement with a subscriber which imposes any charge following disconnection of service, except for reconnection and subsequent monthly or periodic charges, and those charges shall be no greater than charges for new customers. This section shall not prevent a grantee from refusing service to any person because the grantee's prior accounts with that person remain due and owing. 
(i)  Except as may be otherwise provided in a franchise, a grantee may offer service which requires advance payment of periodic service charges for no more than one year in advance subject to the conditions contained in this subsection. A customer shall have the right, at anytime, to have its service disconnected without charge and with a refund of unused service charges paid to the customer within 30 days from the date of service. Rate increases shall not be effective with respect to any subscriber until after the expiration of any period for which advance payment has been accepted by the grantee.

(a)  Opportunity for hearing. The owner or person entitled to possession of a vehicle to be towed as an abandoned vehicle shall have seven days after the date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing, a pre-tow hearing. Subsequent to this seven-day period, the vehicle may be towed, if the owner has not filed a written hearing request within the seven-day period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of this article will be deemed waived. 
(b)  Scheduling. The pre-tow hearing shall be scheduled for a date within 14 days of the mailing or personal delivery of the pretow notice. The municipality shall not be required to delay towing longer than such a 14-day period. 
(c)  Request for hearing. Requests for a pre-tow hearing are to be made in person to the office indicated on the notice. Requests for hearing by persons who reside more than 50 miles from the municipality may be made by mail. Forms for such requests shall be made available at the police department. At the time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing date and time by mail or in person, as the circumstances require. 
(d)  Hearing officer appointed. The municipality shall choose an officer or employee of the municipality to serve as hearing officer. In no case shall that hearing officer be an individual who was involved in the initial decision to tow the vehicle. The hearing officer shall have the authority to require the presence of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed tow or any other municipal personnel. 
(e)  Nature of hearing; preponderance of the evidence standard used. The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing will not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle. After receiving all relevant evidence, the hearing officer shall make a written decision based upon a preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing the vehicle is authorized by state laws or municipal ordinances, with a specific statutory or ordinance section cited in the decision. The owner shall be provided a copy of such pre-tow hearing decision. 
(f)  Decision to remove; fees. If the preponderance of the evidence supports towing and compliance with the provisions of this article, the hearing officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner thereof. The fees to be charged for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates set by the police chief, pursuant to the provisions of this section. The owner of said vehicle having had such a hearing may avoid the towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper location to a proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of the vehicle. 
(g)  Decision not to remove. If the preponderance of the evidence fails to support towing of the vehicle, the hearing officer shall direct that the vehicle shall not be towed. The municipality shall furnish a copy of such decision to the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location plainly visible from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window. No vehicle about which such a decision has been rendered shall be towed by the municipality, unless the circumstances under which the decision was rendered have changed. If at some subsequent time the municipality should wish to tow the vehicle from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures required for the towing of any other similarly situated vehicle. 
(h)  Reports and documents to be retained; appeal. Originals or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports, and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the police department for a period of at least five years after each hearing, or after each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The municipality or the owner may contest the decision of the hearing officer in any manner provided by law.

(a)  Mailing or delivery of notice. Notice pursuant to this section shall be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the owner of the vehicle as indicated in the most current registration list of the secretary of state, unless the notice is personally delivered to the owner, in which case, the date and time of the delivery and the name of the police officer making the delivery shall be noted in the police department records or reports. The notice shall be in the form provided for in sections 38-359, and shall be mailed or delivered within 24 hours of the tow, as provided in section 38-355(1). In the event that the municipality has towed an out-of state hazardous or unlawful vehicle, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall be made of the secretary of state of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished. 
(b)  Posting of signs showing hearing rights. All approved towing service operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least 12 inches by 18 inches, indicating the opportunity and procedures for a hearing to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign, the form for which is referenced in section 38-359, shall be placed in locations readily visible to the public transacting business at any towing facility. If a towing service operator performs services for more than one municipality, the information for contacting the various appropriate municipal offices can be listed in one such sign, the format for which shall be substantially similar to the form referenced in section 38-359. 
(c)  Requests for post-tow hearings. Requests for hearing may be made in person at the office indicated on the notice within 15 days of the mailing or personal delivery of the notification of tow, or release of the vehicle, whichever occurs first; otherwise, the right to a hearing shall be deemed waived. Requests for hearings by persons who reside more than 50 miles from the municipality may be made in person or by mail received by the municipality with the 15-day period. 
(d)  Releasing vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled to possession of any impounded vehicle shall be permitted to remove same, the owner or other person entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of his identity, ownership of the vehicle, or his right to possession, sign a receipt for the vehicle, and pay the amount currently owed for towing and storage fees to the towing service operator. The police chief is authorized to promulgate regulations as to the documents or other proof necessary to establish these facts. 
(e)  Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates. 
(1)  The owner shall pay fees to the towing service operator for towing and storage on police-ordered tows at rates that do not exceed maximum amounts to be administratively established by the police chief and which may be revised from time to time. The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form and sign concerning vehicle release requirements set forth in section 38-359. However, nothing in this article is intended to prevent a competitive towing service operator from charging less than the established maximum rates for police-ordered or any other tows. 
(2)  In arriving at the maximum rates for various services, the police chief shall consider such matters as the prevalent market rates in the area for the different types of vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements for categories such as large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount of work required to perform various types of towing operations. 
(3)  For particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or serious accidents, the police chief is authorized to allow towing operators to charge rates above those established for normal situations, which special charges must be based upon the cost of service provided, taking into account such matters as the man-hours and equipment time required for the job. 
(4)  A towing service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such a billing at special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow, and supply a copy of the itemized bill to the owner and to the police department. Any such special rates charged must be customary in the towing industry in the area for the nature and extent of the services provided. Every towing service operator and the police department shall have available a copy of the complete current rate schedule and any special rate policy established by the police chief, for vehicle owners to view upon request.

Sec. 38-395. - Seizure and impoundment. 
(a)  Whenever a police officer has reason to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility approved by the chief of police. This section shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at that time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered. 
(b)  The police officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle owner's right to request a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing to be conducted under this section. Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearings provided for in the following subsections, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of $500.00 and pays the towing and storage charges. 
(Ord. No. 09-042, § 2, 12-15-2009) 
Sec. 38-396. - Preliminary hearing.

If, after the hearing, the chief of police or his designee determines there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of $500.00, and pay the tower any applicable towing and storage fees. If the chief of police or his designee determines that there is no such probable cause, the vehicle will be released. The owner of record of any such vehicle shall, however, be liable for all towing and storage fees.

The hearing date must be no more than 30 days after a request for a hearing has been filed. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in violation of this section, then the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for the administrative penalty of $500.00, or such lesser sum as the hearing officer determines. If, after a hearing, the hearing officer does not determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in such a violation, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding for the owner and for the return of the vehicle. If the owner of record requests a hearing but fails to appear at the hearing or fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the village in the amount of the administrative penalty. However, if the owner of record pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner, no default order need be entered if the owner is informed of his or her right to a hearing.

(Ord. No. 09-042, § 2, 12-15-2009) 
Sec. 38-399. - Posting of bond. 
    If a bond in the amount of $500.00 is posted with the police department, the impounded vehicle shall be released to the owner of record; the owner of the vehicle shall still be liable to the towing agent for any applicable towing fees. If a penalty is imposed for violation of this section, the amount of the penalty will be forfeited to the village and any amount remaining will be refunded; however, if a violation of this section is not proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the $500.00 bond will be returned to the person posting the bond. All bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the village until the hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until the court issues its decision. 
(Ord. No. 09-042, § 2, 12-15-2009)

Editor's note- Section 2 of Ord. No. 11-021, adopted July 19, 2011, amended the Code by adding provisions designated as Art. XIII, §§ 38-400-38-405. Inasmuch as Art. XIII already exists, the provisions have been redesignated as Art. XIV, §§ 38-421-38-426, at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 38-421. - Established. 
    The police chief or his designee is hereby authorized to direct and supervise a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of enforcing the parking regulations of the Code. The program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle registered to the owner by immobilizing in place of towing as defined herein. The administration of the immobilization program shall be handled by the ordinance enforcement officer. 
(Ord. No. 11-021, § 2, 7-19-2011) 
Sec. 38-422. - Vehicles eligible for immobilization; procedure. 
    If the eligible vehicle is parked or left in violation of any provision of the Municipal Code for which the vehicle is subject to an immediate tow, or in any place where it constitutes an obstruction or hazard, or where it impedes village workers during such operations as snow removal, the vehicle may be towed or relocated to a legal parking place and there restrained. 
(1)  When the registered owner of any vehicle has accumulated three or more final determinations of parking violations or automated traffic law enforcement system liability for which the fines and penalties, if applicable, have not been paid in full, the ordinance enforcement officer shall cause a notice of impending vehicle immobilization to be sent as prescribed in this article. 
(2)  The notice of impending vehicle immobilization shall state the name and address of the registered owner, the state registration number of the vehicle or vehicles registered to the owner, and the serial number of parking violation notices which have resulted in final determination of liability for which the fines or penalties remain unpaid. 
(3)  Failure to pay the fines and penalties owed within 21 days from the date of the notice will result in the inclusion of the state registration number of the vehicle or vehicles of the owner on an immobilization list. 
(4)  A person may challenge the validity of the notice of impending vehicle immobilization by requesting a hearing and appearing in person to submit evidence which would conclusively disprove liability. Upon a request for a hearing, the ordinance enforcement officer shall schedule the hearing for the next regular hearing date. 
(5)  Documentary evidence which would conclusively disprove liability shall be based solely on the following grounds: 
a.  That all fines and penalties for the parking violations cited in the notice have been paid in full; or 
b.  That the registered owner has not accumulated three or more final determinations of parking violation or automatic traffic law enforcement system liability which were unpaid at the time the notice of impending vehicle immobilization was issued. 
(6)  The hearing on eligibility for impoundment shall not provide a venue for a collateral attack on the original determination of liability except to contest service of process. 
(Ord. No. 11-021, § 2, 7-19-2011) 
Sec. 38-423. - Post-immobilization towing notice. 
    Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a post immobilization and towing notice shall be sent to the owner, or if the vehicle is immobilized in place, affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. 
(1)  The affixed notice shall warn that the vehicle is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its damage. The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage to the immobilization restraint is a violation of 720 ILCS 5/16-1 and 720 ILCS 5/21-1. The notice shall also provide information specifying how release of the immobilization restraint may be had, and how the registered owner may obtain a post-immobilization hearing. If the restraint has not been released within 24 hours of its placement, the restraint shall be released and the vehicle towed and impounded. 
(2)  A post-towing notice shall be mailed to the registered owner of a vehicle immobilized by towing. The notice shall contain: 
a.  The date and time the vehicle was towed. 
b.  The location from which it was towed. 
c.  The case number. 
d.  Reference to the cause of the tow for immobilization. 
e.  A statement that the vehicle is subject to towing and storage charges. 
f.  The name, address, telephone number and hours of operation of the storage facility, where the vehicle can be claimed upon payment of towing storage fees, fines and penalties owed. 
(Ord. No. 11-021, § 2, 7-19-2011) 
Sec. 38-424. - Release of immobilized vehicles. 
    The owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized person may secure the release of the vehicle by paying the immobilization, towing and storage fees provided herein, and all fines and penalties remaining due on each final determination of parking violation liability issued to that person. 
(Ord. No. 11-021, § 2, 7-19-2011) 
Sec. 38-425. - Post-immobilization hearing. 
(a)  The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a post-immobilization hearing to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing and impoundment was erroneous, if the owner files a written request for a hearing with the ordinance enforcement officer within 14 days after immobilization or fourteen (14) days of the date of the notice sent pursuant to subsection (b) herein, whichever is later. The determination of the hearing officer regarding the validity of the immobilization shall become final for the purpose of judicial review under the Administrative Review Law of Illinois upon issuance. 
(b)  Within ten days after a vehicle has been impounded, a notice of impoundment shall be sent by first class mail, to the address of the registered owner as listed with the Secretary of State. The notice shall state that the owner has the right to request a post-immobilization and post-towing hearing as provided in subsection (a) herein, and that if the vehicle is not claimed within 30 days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with 625 ILCS 5/4-208. 
(c)  The fee for immobilization in place shall be $50.00 and/or a fee for towing subsequent to the immobilization and a storage fee for every 24-hour period the vehicle is retained shall be assessed. The fees for towing and storage shall be in accordance with the schedule of such fees authorized by the village and maintained by the Lansing Police Department; the amounts currently in force being $125.00 for towing and $35.00 per calendar day for storage. No fees shall be assessed for any immobilization or tow which has been determined to be erroneous. 
(d)  It shall be unlawful to relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilization device without the approval of the police chief or designee. The registered owner of the immobilized vehicle and any person who relocates an immobilized vehicle in violation of this division shall each be subject to a penalty of $750.00 for the violation. 
(Ord. No. 11-021, § 2, 7-19-2011) 
Sec. 38-426. - Driver's license suspension. 
(a)  When a person has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing pursuant to this subchapter on ten or more parking violations or five reports, in accordance with five or more automatic traffic law violations, the ordinance enforcement officer shall cause a notice of impeding driver's license suspension to be sent in the form as required by the Secretary of State. The notice shall state that failure to pay the amount owing within 45 days of the date of the notice will result in the village notifying the Secretary of State that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/6-306.5. 
(b)  If a person sent a notice pursuant to subsection (a) above fails to pay the amount owing within the time stated on the notice, the ordinance enforcement officer may file with the Secretary of State, a certified 625 ILCS 5/6-206.5(c), that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceeding. The ordinance enforcement officer shall assess a $20.00 filing fee against the person named in the certified report to reimburse the village for the expense of preparing and filing the certified report with the Secretary of State. 
(c)  A person named in a certified report filed pursuant to subsection (b) above may, within 21 days of the date of the notice sent by the Secretary of State pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/6-306.5(b), file with the ordinance enforcement officer a written statement and supporting documentation to challenge the report; provided, however, the grounds for such challenge shall be limited to the person not having been the owner or lessee of the vehicle or vehicles receiving ten or more parking violation notices on the date or dates the notices were issued; or the person having already paid the fine and penalty for the ten or more violations indicated on the report. The ordinance enforcement officer shall send notice of the decision on the challenge of the report after receipt thereof. The challenge to the eligibility for suspension proceedings, and any hearing requested under subsection (e) below, shall not provide a venue for a collateral attack on the original determinations of liability except to contest service of process. 
(d)  If a person named in a certified report has paid the previously reported fine or penalty or if the report is determined by the ordinance enforcement officer to be in error, the ordinance enforcement officer shall notify the Secretary of State in accordance with 625 ILCS 5/6-206.5(d). A certified copy of the notification shall be given, upon request and at no charge, to the person named therein. 
(e)  An administrative hearing to contest an impending suspension or suspension may be had upon filing a written request with the Secretary of State. The filing fee for this hearing shall be $20.00, to be paid at the time the request is made. The village shall reimburse the Secretary of State for all reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary as a result of filing a certified report, including but not limited to the costs of providing the required notice and the costs incurred by the Secretary in any hearing conducted with respect to the report and any appeal from a hearing.

(3)  Building drainage, sewer, or vent systems. 
(4)  Any other fixture of similar hazard. 
(g)  Protection against backflow and backsiphonage. The following shall be used to prevent against backflow and backsiphonage: 
(1)  Water outlets. A potable water system shall be protected against backflow and backsiphonage by providing and maintaining at each outlet: 
a.  An airgap, as specified in subsection (g)(2) of this section, between the potable water outlet and the flood level rim of the fixture it supplies or between the outlet and any other source of contamination; or 
b.  A backflow preventer. 
(2)  Minimum required airgap. A potable water system shall be protected against backflow and backsiphonage by providing and maintaining airgaps as follows: 
a.  How measured. The minimum required airgap shall be measured vertically from the lowest end of a potable water outlet to the flood rim or line of the fixture or receptacle into which it discharges. 
b.  Size. The minimum required airgap shall be twice the effective opening of a potable water outlet, unless the outlet is a distance less than three times the effective opening away from a wall or similar vertical surface, in which cases the minimum required airgap shall be three times the effective opening of the outlet. 
(3)  Approval of devices. Before any device for the prevention of backflow or backsiphonage is installed, it shall have first been certified by a recognized testing laboratory acceptable to the agency. Devices installed in a building potable water supply distribution system for protection against backflow shall be maintained in a good working condition by the person responsible for the maintenance of the system. The superintendent of public works or his designee shall inspect routinely such devices and if found to be defective or inoperative shall require the replacement thereof. 
(4)  Installation of devices. A potable water system shall be protected against backflow and backsiphonage by providing and maintaining the following devices: 
a.  Vacuum breakers. Vacuum breakers shall be installed with the critical level at least six inches above the flood level rim of the fixture they serve and on the discharge side of the last control valve to the fixture. No shutoff valve or faucet shall be installed beyond the vacuum breaker. For closed equipment or vessels such as pressure sterilizers, the top of the vessel shall be treated as the flood level rim, but a check valve shall be installed on the discharge side of the vacuum breaker. 
b.  Reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. A reduced pressure principle type backflow preventer may be installed subject to full static pressure. 
c.  Devices of all types. Backflow and backsiphonage preventing devices shall be accessibly located, preferably in the same room with the fixture they serve. Installation in utility or service spaces; provided they are readily accessible, is also permitted. 
(5)  Tanks and vats below rim supply. A potable water system shall be protected against backflow and backsiphonage by providing and maintaining tanks and vats below the rim as follows: 
a.  Where a potable water outlet terminates below the rim of a tank or vat and the tank or vat has an overflow of a diameter that is in compliance with state statute or the village's technical codes, whichever is stricter. 
b.  The potable water outlet to the tank or vat shall terminate at a distance no less than 11/2 times the height to which water can rise in the tank above the top of the overflow. This level shall be established at the maximum flow rate of the supply to the tank or vat and with all outlets, except the airgap overflow outlet closed. 
c.  The distance from the outlet to the high water level shall be measured from the critical point of the potable water supply outlet. 
(6)  Protective devices required. Approved devices to protect against backflow and backsiphonage shall be installed at all fixtures and equipment where backflow and/or backsiphonage may occur and where a minimum airgap cannot be provided between the water outlet to the fixture or equipment and its flood-level rim. 
a.  Connections not subject to backpressure. Where a water connection is not subject to backpressure, a vacuum breaker shall be installed on the discharge side of the last valve on the line serving the fixture or equipment. 
b.  Connections subject to backpressure. Where a potable water connection is made to a line, fixture, tank, vat, pump, or other equipment with a hazard of backflow or backsiphonage where the water connection is subject to backpressure, and an airgap cannot be installed, the superintendent may require the use of an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. 
(7)  Double check-double gate valves. The superintendent may authorize installation of approved, double check-double gate valve assemblies with test cocks as protective devices against backflow in connections between a potable water system and other fluid systems which present no significant health hazard in the judgment of the superintendent. 
(8)  Low pressure cutoff required on booster pumps. When a booster pump is used on a water pressure booster system and the possibility exists that a positive pressure of ten psi or less may occur on the suction side of the pump, there shall be installed a low-pressure cutoff on the booster pump to prevent the creation of a vacuum or negative pressure on the suction side of the pump, thus cutting off water to other outlets.

a.  All single-phased developments which contemplate, or which may otherwise require, the construction of and/or dedication of public improvements, shall be submitted to the village for review by the village engineer.

b.  The engineering review fees shall be paid upon the submittal of the preliminary plan. Should the actual infrastructure improvement costs be unavailable at the time of submittal of the preliminary plan, the developer shall submit, as a viable substitute, an engineer's opinion of the probable construction costs for the proposed public improvements. The village engineer shall review the sufficiency of the tendered improvement costs and either: 
1.  Approve them as submitted; or 
2.  Require that they be revised and resubmitted. 
Improvement costs, actual or estimated, as approved by the village engineer, shall be utilized as the basis for calculating the engineering review fees.

b.  Subsequently, as each phase of the multiphased development is submitted for final plan approval, a percentage of the total engineering review fee shall be due and paid prior to final plan approval for that phase. The amount due for each phase shall be calculated by applying the percentage of infrastructure improvements proposed for that phase (infrastructure improvement cost for phase divided by infrastructure improvement costs for all phases) to the engineering review fees remaining after deducting fees provided in subsection (3) of this section. 
c.  Example. The infrastructure improvement costs amount for the public improvements for the entire (all phases) development: $1,000,000.00. 
d.  Should the actual infrastructure improvement costs be unavailable at the time of the submittal of the preliminary plan, for each phase of the development, the developer shall submit, as a viable substitute, an engineer's opinion of probable construction costs for the proposed public improvements. The village engineer shall review the sufficiency of the tendered improvement costs and either: 
1.  Approve them as submitted; or 
2.  Require that they be revised and resubmitted. 
Improvement costs, actual or estimated, as approved by the village engineer, shall be utilized as the basis for calculating the engineering review fees. Such fees, if based upon estimated amounts, shall be eligible for adjustment in accordance with the infrastructure improvement costs amount when finally determined. Any additional engineering review fees required due to upward revisions in the infrastructure improvement costs shall be paid prior to final plan approval. If the final infrastructure improvement costs amount is less than the initial estimate as submitted by the developer, the initial estimate shall be utilized, unless the difference between the initial estimate and the final infrastructure improvement costs amount is greater than 25 percent, in which case the village shall refund that amount of the difference in excess of 25 percent. 
(5)  Construction observation fees. The village engineer, or his representative, shall observe the construction of the public improvements or utilities for single-phased and multiphased developments that contemplate the construction and/or dedication of public improvements. The fee for the construction observation services shall be determined based upon the cost of the public improvements required by the village and approved by the village engineer, in an amount determined by the board from time to time, as set forth in the fee schedule maintained by the village and available in the office of the village clerk. The construction observation fees shall be paid prior to final plat approval. 
(6)  Development not including public improvements and redevelopment projects. For developments that do not contemplate the construction and/or dedication of public improvements, review and construction observation fees shall be charged to the developer as follows: 
a.  Administrative fees shall be charged in amounts and in the same manner as set forth in subsection (1) of this section. 
b.  Engineering review and construction observation fees shall be charged at the hourly rate specified by the village and in effect at the time such fees are charged. When performed by a consultant acting as village engineer the hourly fee for this work shall be as provided in the consultant engineering contract between the village and the village engineer. When performed by village personnel the hourly fee shall be as established by the village. 
c.  A base fee shall be charged and will be used by the village to cover the initial cost for this work. The base fee shall be in an amount determined by the board from time to time, as set forth in the fee schedule maintained by the village and available in the office of the village clerk which amount shall be adjusted by the village when the project is approved.

(1)  If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. 
(2)  When a party disagrees with the best available data, he shall submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any development of the site. 
(b)  Included in flood insurance study. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of Little Calumet River, Northcreek and Thorncreek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(c)  Extraterritorial jurisdiction. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of the unincorporated county that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(d)  Zones AH and AO. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance rate map of Cook County. 
(e)  A Zone. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the flood insurance rate map of Cook County shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations. 
(1)  When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a Riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model such as HIP. 
(2)  The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. 
(3)  For a Nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record, plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study. 
(4)  For an unmapped extended SFHA, with a drainage area less than one square mile, which has been identified by the building commissioner pursuant to section 52-48(3), the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in section 52-49(e). 
(Ord. No. 08-013, §§ 600.0-604.1.4, 6-17-2008) 
Sec. 52-50. - Occupation and use of flood fringe areas. 
(a)  Applicability. Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of this article. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of section 52-53. 
(b)  Development permit. Permit required prior to beginning development. 
(1)  No person not exempted by law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the building commissioner. 
(2)  An application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the building commissioner. 
a.  The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations, using the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. 
b.  For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section 52-53. 
(3)  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the building commissioner shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
a.  Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map without a permit as required by this article is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the provisions of this article. 
b.  The building commissioner shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(4)  A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include the following: 
a.  A description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects; 
b.  A description of final stabilization and revegetation measures; and 
c.  The identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance. 
(5)  The building commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The building commissioner shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained. 
(c)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
(1)  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
(2)  Compensatory storage. The following criteria shall be met prior to floodplain usage: 
a.  Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
b.  The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. 
c.  In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. 
d.  All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. 
e.  All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(d)  Construction of the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE). A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the village to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The building commissioner shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsections: 
(1)  Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection (c)(2) of this section. 
(2)  The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE). 
(3)  The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the building commissioner may waive the ten-foot minimum setback if a state licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the building commissioner for review. The building commissioner may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
(4)  The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if the site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the building commissioner may waive the 20-foot minimum setback distance if a state licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the building commissioner for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
(5)  The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all the requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes. 
(6)  The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction. 
(7)  All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by a state licensed professional engineer, as warranted by the site conditions. 
(8)  The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five below the BFE. 
(9)  There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one-quarter horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure. 
(10)  The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow. 
(11)  All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices. 
(12)  If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding subsections of this subsection, the building commissioner may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE, only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by a state licensed professional engineer. 
(13)  In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed 18 inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

(c)  Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses. 
(1)  The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Admin. Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
a.  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife; 
b.  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses; 
c.  Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls; 
d.  Underground and overhead utilities; 
e.  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four-stall maximum) that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage; 
f.  Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage; 
g.  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto; 
h.  Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either: 
1.  The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot; or 
2.  The applicant of a shortterm recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
i.  Designated floodway regarding, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slop toward a watercourse; 
j.  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures, including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure; 
k  The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building; provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to 50 percent or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation; 
l.  Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows, including, but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved to 50 percent or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
(2)  Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing, including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence, and storage of materials, except as specifically defined in subsection (c)(1) of this section as an appropriate use. 
(3)  Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible; provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a licensed professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 52-53: 
a.  Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events, up to and including, the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
1.  Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR 2/3 ) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959)). 
2.  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions, unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can ensure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
3.  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used, unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(i)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one-foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
(ii)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one-foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
(iii)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
(iv)  Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
(v)  All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
b.  Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. 
1.  Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. 
2.  Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost. 
3.  Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. 
4.  The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
5.  If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. 
6.  There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure. 
c.  Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream erosion or flood heights. 
1.  For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events, up to and including, the 100-year frequency event. 
2.  In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures. 
d.  Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. 
1.  The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events, up to and including, the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
2.  If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1-foot the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver. 
(i)  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 52-49. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models. 
(ii)  Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection (c)(3)b of this section. 
(iii)  Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection (c)(3)c of this section. 
(iv)  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation an IDNR/OWR permit must be received. 
(v)  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this section. 
(vi)  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection (c)(3)h of this section. 
e.  Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and approach roads. 
1.  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1-foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies, up to and including, the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
2.  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
3.  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 17 Ill. Admin. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
f.  On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. 
1.  Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0-foot, when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events, up to and including, the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
2.  A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. 
3.  All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 52-46 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Admin. Code Part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(i)  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention; 
(ii)  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
(iii)  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation basin. 
4.  A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control. 
5.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
g.  Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. 
1.  If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. 
2.  Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
h.  Excavation in the floodway. 
1.  When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for the lost conveyance or other appropriate use, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. 
2.  The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used, unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(i)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one-foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length; 
(ii)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one-foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; 
(iii)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used; and 
(iv)  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
i.  If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
2.  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
3.  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
(i)  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible to those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified the restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
(ii)  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
(iii)  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
(iv)  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for the construction of the channel. 
(v)  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
(vi)  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of the construction. An erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover.

Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
(viii)  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of the downstream water quality. 
(ix)  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
(x)  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood, unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
(xi)  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
(xii)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
j.  For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
k.  For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is a potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
2.  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. At a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade, but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
3.  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off-site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
4.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing channels (see subsection (c)(3)p of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
5.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
l.  For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
m.  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
1.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in section 52-49 must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
2.  If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet: 
(i)  The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and

If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
n.  Conditional letter of map revision. 
1.  If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to the IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from the IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. 
2.  The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. 
3.  In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. 
4.  No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. 
5.  After the initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from the IDNR/OWR. 
o.  All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer. 
p.  For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
1.  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
2.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of the construction. 
q.  After the receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon the acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built" plans.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the planning and development director shall have the authority to waive any required submission requirement, when, in his reasonable judgment, such waiver is appropriate in light of the nature and extent of the action requested.

Every application filed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be accompanied by the required filing fee and/or deposit as established, and modified from time to time, by the village board of trustees. The owner of the subject property and, if different, the applicant shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the application fee.

Within ten days of such notification, the applicant shall notify the village of his intent to pursue the application, propose a schedule for completion of submission requirements, and request an extension of time. Failure to provide such notification, schedule and request shall be grounds for dismissal of the application. If the applicant proposes a schedule for completion of submission requirements and requests an extension of time, the proposal and request shall be considered by the village official or at the next scheduled meeting of the board reviewing the application. The village official or board may approve, modify or deny the proposed schedule and request for extension of time.

(9)  Successive applications. Whenever any application filed pursuant to this chapter has been denied on its merits, a second application seeking essentially the same relief or request cannot be filed within one year of the date of denial. This restriction shall apply whether or not such second application is in the same form or of the same theory as the original application. A second application may, at the discretion of the planning and development director, be reviewed and/or heard if there is substantial new evidence available or a mistake of law or fact that significantly affected the prior denial. Any subsequent application shall include a detailed statement of the grounds justifying its consideration. If the planning and development director finds that there are no grounds for consideration of the subsequent application, the request may be denied by the planning and development director summarily and without hearing.

(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 2.13) 
Sec. 56-100. - Special uses. 
(a)  Purpose. Special uses are those uses having some special impact or uniqueness that require a careful review of their location, design, configuration and special impact to determine, against fixed standards, the desirability of permitting their establishment on any given site. They are uses that may or may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a weighing in each case of the public need and benefit against the local impact and affect. 
(b)  Parties entitled to request. Applications for special uses may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a right of ownership in, any property in the village. 
(c)  Board's authority. The village board, after receiving a recommendation by the planning and zoning board of appeals, shall take formal action on special use requests. 
(d)  Applications. Applications for special use review shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 56-92. 
(e)  Procedures. 
(1)  Acceptance of application by the village clerk. Upon receipt of a completed application, the village clerk shall distribute the application to the planning and development director and other village department heads for review. The village clerk shall schedule the application for an upcoming planning and zoning board of appeals agenda for consideration. 
(2)  Hearing held by planning and zoning board of appeals. The planning and zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing on the application in accordance with the requirements of section 56-93. Public hearings shall be held within 60 days of the filing of the completed application. 
(3)  Notice. Notice for the public hearing shall be performed in the manner prescribed by section 56-93. 
(4)  Findings of fact; recommendation. Within 15 days of the close of the public hearing, the planning and zoning board of appeals shall forward its findings of fact and recommendation of denial, approval, or approval with conditions, in writing, to the village board of trustees. 
(5)  Action by village board of trustees. The village board of trustees shall consider the application within 45 days of receiving the findings of fact and recommendation from the planning and zoning board of appeals. The action taken by the village board may take the form of a denial, approval, or approval with conditions. 
(f)  Approval standards. An application for a special use permit shall not be approved, unless the application is determined to be in conformance with each of the following standards, in addition to any standards specific to the use contained in article X of this chapter. The proposed special use: 
(1)  Is in fact, a special use listed and authorized in the zoning district within which the property is located. 
(2)  Is consistent with the objectives of the village's comprehensive plan and this chapter. 
(3)  Is designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity. 
(4)  Will not significantly diminish the safety, use and enjoyment of surrounding property. 
(5)  Is adequately served by essential public facilities and services such as streets, police and fire service, drainage, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools, or the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed special use shall adequately provide any such services. 
(6)  Does not create excessive additional requirements at public expense for public facilities and services, and will not be detrimental to the village's public health, safety, and welfare. 
(7)  Does not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors. 
(8)  Provides vehicular access to the property designed so as not to create interference with traffic on surrounding public thoroughfares. 
(9)  Does not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural, scenic or historic feature of major importance. 
(10)  Complies with all additional regulations in this chapter specific to the special use requested. 
(g)  Additional standards for planned developments. The village has previously established the process for review of planned developments. Planned development regulations allow for the development of innovative and environmentally-sensitive design by allowing a degree of flexibility in the strict application of the zoning district regulations. 
(1)  A planned development is a special use which may be granted by the village board should it determine that the planned development is: 
a.  In the village's best interest; 
b.  Substantially consistent with the comprehensive plan; and 
c.  Would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this chapter. 
(2)  The planning and zoning board of appeals may recommend, and the village board may require, any condition or design consideration that will promote the proper development of or benefit to the community. In exchange for the flexibility permitted under this section, the planned development should provide amenities not otherwise required, and establish facilities and open space greater than the minimum required by this chapter. It is not intended that the village board automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density premiums in the case of each planned development. The planning and zoning board of appeals shall recommend, and the village board shall grant, only those premiums or latitudes that are consistent with the village character. 
(3)  Because planned developments are of such substantially different character from other special uses, specific and additional standards and exceptions are set forth to govern the recommendations of the planning and zoning board of appeals and the action of the village board. These specific standards are contained in article X of this chapter. 
(h)  Supplementary conditions and safeguards. The planning and zoning board of appeals may recommend, and the village board of trustees may provide, such conditions and restrictions upon the construction, location and operation of a special use, as may be deemed necessary to promote the general objectives of this chapter and to minimize any injury to the value of property in the neighborhood. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for the revocation of such special use approval, pursuant to section 56-104. 
(i)  No presumption of approval. The listing of special uses within each zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that such special use will be approved. Rather, each proposed special use shall be evaluated on an individual basis in order to determine whether approval of the special use is appropriate at the particular location and in the particular manner proposed. The following factors will be considered: 
(1)  The relation of the special use to its compliance with the standards and conditions set forth in this section; 
(2)  Any standards specific to the use as set forth in article X of this chapter; and 
(3)  The standards for the district in which it is located, in order to determine whether approval of the special use is appropriate at the particular location and in the particular manner proposed. 
(j)  Limitations. 
(1)  Special use approval shall automatically become null and void, unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun within one year of issuance and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. However, the village board may extend the one-year period to a mutually agreed upon time. 
(2)  Special use approval authorizes the conduct of the special use only on the property represented in the application and is not transferable to other properties. 
(3)  Any modification or intensification of a special use that alters the essential character or operation of the use in a way not intended at the time the special use was granted, as evidenced by the record or text of the ordinance, shall require a new special use approval. 
(4)  The approval of a special use authorizes the property to be used in the manner proposed, but does not alone authorize the establishment or extension of any use, nor development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, without first obtaining any other required permit, including a zoning certificate, building permit and certificate of occupancy. 
(k)  Records; copies. A record of all requests for special uses, including village action taken, shall be kept on file in the village clerk's office and copies shall be available, on request, to any person, for a fee specified by the village. 
(l)  General standards. No special use permit shall be granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant can establish that: 
(1)  Code and plan purposes. The proposed use and development will be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this Code was enacted and for which the regulations of the district in question were established. Said use will further be consistent and compatible with the preservation of the village's business districts by limiting the uses therein to commercial retail stores, commercial establishments, service establishments and professional offices that generate sales tax revenues, and maintain the village's property tax base. 
(2)  No undue adverse impact. The proposed use and development will not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the character of the area, or the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(3)  No interference with surrounding development. The proposed use and development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the use and development of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations. 
(4)  Adequate public facilities. The proposed use and development will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, parks, libraries, and the like, or the applicant will provide adequately for such services. 
(5)  No traffic congestion. The proposed use and development will not cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through residential streets. 
(6)  No destruction of significant features. The proposed use and development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant importance. 
(7)  Compliance with standards. The proposed use and development complies with all standards imposed on that use and any district where it is a permitted use. Submission of a site plan, business plan and demonstration of financial ability must be included in the application for special use submitted to the planning and zoning board of appeals for consideration.

Sec. 56-101. - Variations. 
(a)  Purpose. The village has previously established the process for review of variation requests. The process is to provide a narrowly circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications of this chapter that create practical difficulties or particular hardships. 
(b)  Parties entitled to request. Applications for special uses may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a right of ownership in, any property in the village. 
(c)  Board's authority; recommendation. The planning and zoning board of appeals shall review and make recommendations on variation requests. 
(1)  The building committee may choose to accept the recommendation of the planning and zoning board of appeals and the petitioner can then apply for a building permit. 
(2)  The building committee may refer the petitioner to the village board for review consideration. 
(3)  The village board of trustees may, after receiving a planning and zoning board of appeals recommendation from the building committee of the village board, vote to consider the application. In this case, the village board of trustees shall take formal action on variations. 
(d)  Applications. Applications for variations shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section 56-92. 
(e)  Procedures. 
(1)  Acceptance of application by the village clerk. Upon receipt of a completed application, the village clerk shall distribute the application to the planning and development director and other village staff for review. The village clerk shall schedule the application for an upcoming planning and zoning board of appeals agenda for consideration. 
(2)  Recommendation by planning and zoning board of appeals and review by the building committee. 
a.  The planning and zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing on the application in accordance with the requirements of section 56-93. Public hearings shall be held within 60 days of the filing of the completed application. 
b.  Notice for the public hearing shall be performed in the manner prescribed by section 56-93. 
(3)  Within ten days of the close of the public hearing, the planning and zoning board of appeals shall forward its findings of fact and recommendation of denial, approval, or approval with conditions, in writing, to the building committee of the village board. The building committee shall review the recommendation of the planning and zoning board of appeals within ten days, and determine if the recommendation should be reviewed by the village board. If the building committee determines it necessary, they shall forward the recommendation of the planning and zoning board of appeals to the village board for consideration. Where the building committee determines consideration by the village board is unnecessary, the recommendation of the planning and zoning board of appeals shall be the final decision. 
(4)  Action by village board of trustees. Upon receipt of the planning and zoning board's recommendation from the building committee, the village board of trustees may, by a majority vote at its next meeting, determine that the recommendation should be reviewed. Where the village board of trustees votes to review the recommendation, they shall make a final decision on the application for variations within 30 days of receiving the findings of fact and recommendation from the planning and zoning board of appeals. The action taken by the village board may take the form of a denial, approval, or approval with conditions. 
(f)  Findings of fact. A variation from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted, unless the planning and zoning board of appeals, and where required, the village board makes specific written findings of fact directly based on the standards and conditions imposed by this section and any other conditions imposed. 
(1)  Hardship. No variation shall be granted, unless the applicant shall establish that carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this chapter would create a practical difficulty or particular hardship. 
(2)  Unique physical condition. The subject property is exceptional, as compared to other properties subject to the same provisions, by reason of a unique physical condition, including the: 
a.  Presence of an existing use, structure or sign, whether conforming or nonconforming; 
b.  Irregular or substandard shape or size; 
c.  Exceptional topographical features; or 
d.  Other extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to, and inherent in, the subject property that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner and that relate to, or arise out of, the property rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the property. 
(3)  Not self-created. The aforesaid unique physical condition is not the result of any action or inaction of the owner, or his predecessors in title, and existed at the time of the enactment of the provisions from which a variation is sought, was created by natural forces, or was the result of governmental action, other than the adoption of this chapter. 
(4)  Denied substantial rights. The carrying out of the strict letter of the provision from which a variation is sought would deprive the owner of the subject property of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other properties subject to the same provisions. 
(5)  Not merely special privilege. The alleged hardship or difficulty is neither: 
a.  Merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some special privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of other lots subject to the same provision; nor 
b.  Merely the inability of the owner to make more money from the use of the subject property. 
(6)  Ordinance and plan purposes. The variation would not result in a use or development of the subject property that would not be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this chapter, and the provision from which a variation is sought, were enacted or the general purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan. 
(7)  No other remedy. There is no means, other than the requested variation, by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the subject property. 
(8)  Minimum required. The requested variation is the minimum measure of relief necessary to alleviate the alleged hardship or difficulty presented by the strict application of this chapter. 
(g)  Variation less than requested. The planning and zoning board of appeals may grant variations less than or different from that requested when the record supports the applicant's right to some relief, but not to the entire relief requested. 
(h)  Conditions. The planning and zoning board of appeals may impose specific conditions and limitations, concerning the use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this chapter, upon any lot benefitted by a variation as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject lot or upon public facilities and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance or order granting the variation. The violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this chapter and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variation. 
(i)  Limitations. 
(1)  An approved variation shall automatically become null and void, unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun within one year of issuance and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. However, the village board may extend the one-year period to a mutually agreed upon time. 
(2)  A variation only authorizes the conduct of the variation on the property represented in the application, and is not transferable to other properties. 
(3)  A variation shall be deemed to authorize only the particular construction or development for which it was issued, but does not alone authorize the establishment or extension of any use, nor development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure without first obtaining any other required permit, including a zoning certificate, building permit, and certificate of occupancy. The approved variation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such construction or development is beyond the scope so authorized. 
(j)  Records; copies. A record of all requests for variations, including village action taken, shall be kept on file in the village clerk's office and copies shall be available, on request, to any person, for a fee specified by the village.

ARTICLE III. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 56-124. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish regulations and limitations on the continued existence of uses, buildings, platted lots or structures established prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, which do not conform to the provisions of this chapter. Many such nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this article are designed to curtail substantial investment in such nonconformities and to bring about their eventual elimination, where appropriate, in order to preserve the integrity of the zoning districts and regulations established by this chapter. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 3.1) 
Sec. 56-125. - Authority to continue if lawful prior to adoption of this chapter. 
    Any nonconforming buildings, structures, platted lots and uses that existed lawfully at the time of adoption of this chapter and which remain nonconforming, and any such building, structure, platted lot, or use that has become nonconforming upon adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or of any subsequent amendments thereto, may be continued subject to the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 3.2) 
Sec. 56-126. - Uses of land, buildings or structures; exceptions. 
    This category of nonconformities consists of land, buildings, or structures that are used for purposes on May 1, 2003, this being the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or any amendment thereto, not permitted in the zoning district in which they are located. Such uses may be continued as follows. 
(1)  Expansion of use prohibited. A nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures shall not be expanded, extended, enlarged or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without limitation: 
a.  An expansion or extension of a use, including its accessory uses, to any structure, building or land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use on May 1, 2003, this being the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or any amendment thereto, that causes such use to become nonconforming. 
b.  An expansion or extension of such use, including its accessory uses, within a building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on May 1, 2003, being the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or any amendment thereto, that causes such use to become nonconforming. 
(2)  Relocation of use. A nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures shall not be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot or parcel, or to any other lot or parcel, unless the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so relocated. 
(3)  Change in use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other than a use permitted within the zoning district in which the use is located. When such a nonconforming use has been changed, in whole or in part, to a permitted use, the whole or part which has been made to conform may not thereafter be changed back to a use that is not permitted. 
(4)  Discontinuation or abandonment of use. If a nonconforming use is discontinued, or becomes vacant, and remains unoccupied, for a continuous period of 180 days, regardless of the intent to resume or not terminate the use, such use shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land, building or structure shall comply with all regulations of the zoning district in which such land, building or structure is located. 
(5)  Ordinary repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on any building that is devoted in whole, or in part, to a nonconforming use, subject to section 56-94, where required. No structural alterations shall be performed on any building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use, except in the following situations where the alteration: 
a.  Is required by law. 
b.  Will result in eliminating the nonconforming use. 
c.  Will not create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building in any manner. 
(6)  Damage and destruction. 
a.  In the event that any building or structure that is devoted, in whole or in part, to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the property owner, to the extent of 50 percent or more of its replacement value at that time, then the building or structure shall not be restored or rebuilt unless the building or structure, including the foundation, and the use thereof, shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. The replacement value of the building or structure shall be based on the: 
1.  Sale price if it had been sold within the past 12 months; 
2.  Appraised value, if it had been appraised within the past 24 months; or 
3.  Amount for which the building or structure was insured prior to the date of the damage or destruction. 
b.  When such building or structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the property owner, to the extent of less than 50 percent of the replacement value at that time, it may be repaired and reconstructed and used for the same purposes as before the damage or destruction, provided that: 
1.  A building permit is obtained and such repair or reconstruction is started within 12 months of the date of damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. 
2.  No repairs or reconstruction shall be made that would create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any previously existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building in any manner. 
c.  In the event that a building permit is not obtained within 12 months, or that repairs are not diligently pursued, then the building or structure shall not be restored unless the building or structure, and use conform to all regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed by means within the control of the property owner, the building or structure as restored or repaired shall comply with all requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 3.3) 
Sec. 56-127. - Buildings and structures. 
    This category of nonconformities consists of buildings and structures that are existing on May 1, 2003, this being the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or any amendment thereto, for which the size or location does not conform with the yard, height, floor area ratio, or other dimensional or bulk provisions of this article, or any amendment thereto. Such buildings or structures shall only be continued as follows: 
(1)  Additions and enlargements. A nonconforming building or structure, which is nonconforming with respect to its bulk, may be added to or enlarged; provided that such addition or enlargement does not increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of the building or structure. In determining the extent of the allowable addition or enlargement, the nonconformity of the building shall be based only upon those portions of the building having both foundation and roof. A nonconforming building or structure shall not be added to or enlarged if such addition or enlargement would increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of the building or structure, such as by encroaching farther into required setbacks than the existing encroachment. However, under no circumstances shall a nonconforming building or structure be added to or enlarged, unless such nonconforming building or structure, including additions and enlargements thereto, shall conform to the following: 
a.  Applicable regulations concerning the amount of lot area provided per dwelling unit, as provided in subsequent articles of this chapter. 
b.  The allowable floor area ratio, as provided in subsequent articles of this chapter. 
(2)  Relocation. A nonconforming building or structure shall not be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot or parcel, or to any other lot or parcel, unless the building or structure thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so relocated. A building permit shall be obtained prior to relocation. 
(3)  Ordinary repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on any nonconforming building or structure, subject to section 56-94, where required. No structural alterations shall be performed on any nonconforming building or structure, except in the following situations where the alteration: 
a.  Is required by law. 
b.  Will result in eliminating the nonconformity. 
c.  Will not create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building in any manner. 
(4)  Damage and destruction. 
a.  In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means that is not within the control of the property owner, to the extent of 50 percent or more of its replacement value at that time, then the building or structure shall not be restored or rebuilt unless the building or structure, including the foundation, and the use thereof, shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. The replacement value of the building or structure shall be based on the: 
1.  Sale price if it had been sold within the past 12 months; 
2.  Appraised value, if it had been appraised within the past 24 months; or 
3.  Amount for which the building or structure was insured prior to the date of the damage or destruction. 
b.  When such building or structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means that is not within the control of the property owner, to the extent of less than 50 percent of the replacement value at that time, it may be repaired and reconstructed and used for the same purposes as it was before the damage or destruction, provided that: 
1.  A building permit is obtained and such repair or reconstruction is started within 12 months of the date of damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. 
2.  No repairs or reconstruction shall be made that would create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any previously existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building in any manner. In the event that a building permit is not obtained within 12 months or that repairs are not diligently pursued, then the building or structure shall not be restored unless the building, structure and use conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed by means within the control of the property owner, the building or structure as restored or repaired shall comply with all the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 3.4) 
Sec. 56-128. - Lots of record. 
    This category of nonconformities consists of lots of record that are existing on May 1, 2003, this being the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or any amendment thereto, for which the lot does not conform with the minimum lot area or lot width requirements for the zoning district in which it is located, as specified by this article, or any amendment thereto. Such nonconforming lots of record may only be built upon as follows: 
(1)  Individual nonconforming lots of record. 
a.  In any district permitting single-family residences, notwithstanding the limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and accessory buildings may be erected on a single nonconforming lot of record; provided that the lot is in separate ownership and does not have continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. 
b.  This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the minimum lot area or lot width requirements generally applicable in the zoning district; provided that the setback and other bulk requirements of the lot shall conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which such lots are located, except as follows: 
1.  Side yards may be reduced to ten percent of the lot width on interior lots. 
2.  Side yards abutting a street on corner lots may be reduced to 15 feet. 
3.  Front yards may be reduced to the average front yard setback on the block face. 
(2)  Nonconforming lots of record held in common ownership. If on May 1, 2003, this being the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or any amendment thereto, two or more lots of record with continuous frontage in single ownership do not meet the minimum lot width or lot area requirements, as established by this chapter, the land so involved shall be considered to be a single undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter. No portion of said parcel shall be used, transferred or conveyed that does not meet the lot width and lot area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves the remaining lot with lot width or area below the requirements as stated in this chapter. No building permit shall be issued for the use of any lot, or portion of a lot, transferred or conveyed in violation of this section.

Sec. 56-196. - Purpose statements. 
(a)  B1-T downtown transition overlay district. The purpose of the B1-T downtown transition overlay district is to provide an appropriate transition between the downtown commercial area and adjacent residential neighborhoods. The overlay district provides for commercial, mixed-use and residential opportunities at the edge of the downtown area in a manner that ensures that the bulk, intensity and design of development is compatible with adjacent single-family neighborhoods. This overlay district also seeks to maintain residential property values by minimizing the intrusion of commercial uses into residential areas. Adaptive reuse or redevelopment of nonresidential sites is encouraged, but all development proposals will be required to demonstrate a sensitivity toward adjacent residential uses. Additionally, this overlay district also provides for the conversion of residential structures into compatible small-scale office and personal service establishments, and multiple-family uses that retain their residential character. 
(b)  B2 community retail and service districts. The purpose of the B2 community retail and service district is to maintain and promote a mix of commercial uses that provide goods and services for the village as a whole, and for the convenience of residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. 
(c)  B3 general business districts. The purpose of the B3 general business district is to maintain and promote a broad mix of large-scale and small-scale retail, service and office uses that provide goods and services for the village, as well as the surrounding region. 
(d)  CBD downtown district. The purpose of the CBD downtown district is to establish a zoning district that recognizes and protects the unique scale and character of the downtown village by permitting compatible uses that enhance this physical character. This zoning district also permits compatible residential uses located above the ground floor of business establishments. The CBD district is differentiated from other business districts in that its pattern of development has traditionally been oriented toward the pedestrian, and the use, yard and bulk standards reflect the village's desire to maintain this traditional development pattern.

Cultural facilities with an assembly space capacity of more than 600 people shall be located on an arterial or collector street, as defined by the comprehensive plan. 
(l)  Wireless communications facilities. Wireless communications facilities shall be allowed as permitted and special uses, subject to the following standards. 
(1)  Purpose. 
a.  The purpose of this section is to provide specific regulations for the placement, construction, removal and modification of wireless telecommunication facilities. The provisions of this section are not intended, and shall not be interpreted, to prohibit, or have effect of prohibiting, the provision of personal wireless services, nor shall the provisions be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent wireless services. 
b.  In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the community, the village finds that these regulations are necessary in order to: 
1.  Facilitate the provision of wireless communication services to the residents and businesses of the village. 
2.  Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and siting standards. 
3.  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements. 
4.  Maximize the use of existing and approved towers, structures and water towers to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community. 
(2)  Review requirements. 
a.  Only collocation on previously approved existing towers/facilities, or replacement of previously approved existing towers/facilities with same or similar installation, with no additional height, shall be allowed without special use petitioning. 
b.  Due to the rapid change in industry standards and technology of the wireless communication field, all requests for new, additional or changes to existing towers and facilities shall be subject to special use petitioning to the planning and zoning board of appeals. The planning and zoning board of appeals shall act in a reasonable time and manner to review and act upon all formal applications for wireless communications facilities as it does for other special use requests. The applicant will be responsible for applying and following procedures necessary for special use consideration. 
(3)  Locational criteria. 
a.  Wireless communication facilities shall be allowed in manufacturing and business districts in the village. 
b.  These facilities shall not be allowed in residential districts, except for the location on government and school sites. Church sites may be approved, when camouflaged as steeples or bell towers. Park sites may be approved, when compatible with the nature of the park and approved by the Lan-Oak Park District. The location will further be restricted as to not interfere with the regular operations of the Lansing Municipal Airport and its existing and proposed flight patterns. 
c.  Locational preference will be given to: 
1.  Existing towers or public facilities, including water towers. 
2.  Manufacturing and business districts. 
3.  Government, school and park sites, when approved by the respective governmental body. 
4.  Residential zoned sites not previously identified or restricted. 
(4)  Collocation requirements. No newly proposed wireless communication facilities shall be approved unless the applicant demonstrates that the planned facility cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a reasonable technically feasible radius of the proposed facility. Demonstration can include the structural limitations of the existing facility, the mechanical incompatibility, the height needs of the proposed unit, and the nonavailability of existing facilities. Any newly proposed wireless communication facility shall be structurally and electrically designed in such a way as to accommodate at least one additional service provider antenna installation. Towers shall be designed to allow for further rearrangement and to accept antennas mounted at various heights. Any newly proposed facility applicant shall agree to cooperate with future applicants to accommodate collocation of facilities. 
(5)  Setback requirements. Wireless communication facilities shall conform with the underlying setback requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. The facility shall not be installed in the front setback between the principal structure and the public right-of-way. In industrial districts, the facilities may be installed in the rear yard setbacks of industrial properties, provided the property abuts another industrially zoned property. 
(6)  Height requirements. Wireless communication facilities shall conform with the underlying height requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. 
(7)  Lighting requirements. Wireless communication facilities shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not display strobe lights, unless such lighting is specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other similar authority. When incorporated into the approved design of the facility, light fixtures may be installed for the purpose of illuminating adjacent land uses such as parking lots, public spaces and park facilities. 
(8)  Signs and advertising. The use of any portion of the wireless communication facility for advertising shall not be allowed. 
(9)  Accessory utility buildings. All accessory utility buildings or structures shall meet the underlying zoning district's setback requirements and shall be architecturally designed and appropriately screened from view to complement the character of the surrounding land uses. 
(10)  Construction commencement and completion. Applicants for construction or installation of personal communication facility shall begin construction of their facility within six months, and complete construction within 12 months, of being granted special use permission. The construction will only be allowed when the applicant demonstrates, at building permitting stage or before, the commitment of an actual user for the facility. Speculative construction of facilities will not be allowed. 
(11)  Abandoned or unused facilities. All abandoned or unused facilities shall be removed within six months of the cessation of operation at the site, unless a time extension is granted by the building commissioner. A copy of the relevant portions of the ground lease referencing the arrangements for the removal must be submitted at application. Should the removal not be performed in the allotted time period, the village may take action to do so and the costs of removal will be assessed against the property. 
(12)  Submittal requirements. An applicant shall be required to provide the submission items listed on the application. 
(m)  Kennels. Kennels shall be permitted as special uses; provided they shall not create a public nuisance. 
(n)  Major and minor motor vehicle service and repair; motor vehicle sales and rental. 
(1)  Automobile sales, whether new or used, shall be located on a lot at least one acre in size. Gas stations with food sales or fast food restaurants shall provide parking for the food sales or restaurant area in addition to the parking required for the gas station. 
(2)  Minor motor vehicle service and repair shops, including gas stations, may not store vehicles on the site for longer than five-working days.

Sec. 56-290. - Temporary uses. 
(a)  General provisions. Every permitted temporary use shall comply with the limitations of this article. Except as expressly provided in this article, every temporary use shall comply with the bulk, space and yard regulations applicable in the zoning district in which the temporary use is located. Every temporary use shall comply with, and the village may impose, such other conditions as may reasonably be necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter or to protect the public health, safety and welfare. No temporary use shall be permitted in any zoning district if it would have a significant negative impact on any adjacent property or on the area as a whole in which it is located. Temporary uses not specifically listed here may be allowed in any zoning district; provided that such temporary use is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter and of the zoning district in which it is located. Any such temporary use shall require the specific prior approval of the board of trustees. Every temporary use shall comply with all the requirements listed below. 
(1)  No temporary use shall be permitted that causes, or threatens to cause, an on-site or off-site threat to the health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. 
(2)  No temporary use shall be operated, except in accordance with such restrictions and conditions as the fire department may require. If required by the village, the operator of the temporary use shall employ a fire watch team and appropriate security personnel. 
(3)  No temporary use shall be permitted if the additional vehicular traffic reasonably expected to be generated by such temporary use would have undue detrimental effects on the surrounding streets and uses. 
(4)  No temporary use shall be authorized that would, in the opinion of the planning and development director, unreasonably reduce the amount of parking spaces available for use in connection with permanent uses located on the lot in question. The planning and development director may make an assessment of the total number of parking spaces that will be reasonably required in connection with a proposed temporary use, on the basis of the particular use, its intensity and the availability of other parking facilities in the area.

Secs. 56-291-56-309. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XI. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 56-310. - General provisions. 
    Off-street parking is permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts; provided that it complies with this article. Off-street parking as a principal use is permitted only when expressly authorized by the regulations of the applicable zoning district. 
(1)  No reduction of required spaces. Any off-street parking or loading space required in connection with buildings or structures existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall not be removed, except in conformance with the requirements of this chapter. Any building or structure that is erected or substantially altered after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall provide off-street parking and loading spaces in accordance with this article. 
(2)  Provision of additional spaces. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities; provided that such facilities meet the requirements of this chapter governing the location, design and operation of such facilities. 
(3)  Limitations on use of parking and loading spaces. No motor vehicle repair work of any kind shall be permitted in any parking space, parking lot or loading berth. The repair or maintenance of motor vehicles conducted as a business or commercial activity is prohibited in off-street parking facilities located in a residential district. 
(4)  Change in land use. Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be changed to a new type of use, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new type of use. For those buildings and structures erected prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, additional parking and loading facilities shall be provided only in the amount by which the requirements for the new type of use exceed the requirement for the existing type of use. 
(5)  Change in intensity of use. When a building or structure shall undergo any increase in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other unit of measurement, parking and loading facilities shall be provided for such increase in intensity. If, however, additional parking or loading facilities cannot be added, in whole or in part, due to a lack of available land area, a property owner may request a variation from this provision. The planning and zoning board of appeals shall consider each variation request as it relates to the standards established in section 56-101. 
(6)  Buildings erected prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. This article shall not be construed to require the addition of any parking or loading spaces for uses in buildings or structures existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. When a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and construction has begun within one year and has been diligently pursued, parking and loading facilities shall be provided in the amount required for the issuance of the permit, regardless of any amount required by this article. 
(7)  Site plan review. Any application for a building permit or occupancy permit for a new or enlarged building, structure or use, except for a single-family home, shall include a site plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any off-street parking or loading facilities to be provided. In accordance with section 56-98, the planning and development director shall review the site plan for compliance with this article. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 11.1) 
Sec. 56-310. - Computation. 
(a)  Basis. The total number of required parking and loading spaces shall be based upon the requirements for the principal use of the lot. However, when more than one use occupies the same lot, the number of required spaces shall be the sum of the separate requirements for each use. All off-street parking facilities shall be completed before occupancy of the building or structure it serves. 
(b)  Fractional spaces. When determination of the number of required off-street parking or loading spaces results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be dropped, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space. 
(c)  Bench seating. In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or similar seating facilities, each 22 inches of such seating facility shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for off-street parking facilities under this chapter. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 11.2) 
Sec. 56-311. - Design and size. 
(a)  Dimensions. A required off-street parking space shall be of a size indicated in the following illustration, exclusive of access drives, aisles, ramps and columns.

(b)  Surfacing and striping. All off-street parking areas and driveways shall be improved with a hard surface pavement as specified in the current edition of the state department of transportation design manual or alternate approved by the village. Striping of the surface to define each parking space shall be provided and visible at all times. 
(c)  Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or a driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking spaces. All off-street parking facilities shall be provided with appropriate means of vehicular access in a manner which least interferes with traffic movements and allows the driver of the vehicle to proceed forward into traffic rather than back out. All required off-street parking facilities shall have vehicular access from a street, alley or driveway, containing all-weather, hard surfaced pavement. The location and route of access to such a parking area shall be identified. Except for access to loading berths, no driveway across public property and no driveway serving a single-family residence shall have a width exceeding 24 feet, exclusive of curb returns. Parking spaces shall not be located in a manner such that parked vehicles would obstruct fire department connections, hydrants, fire lanes or emergency access to the site. 
(d)  Drainage. All parking and loading areas shall be graded and drained to dispose of surface water accumulation by means of a positive stormwater drainage system connected to a public storm sewer system. Runoff from parking lots shall be detained on-site in accordance with applicable village standards. 
(e)  Screening. All open parking areas shall be effectively screened in accordance with article XII of this chapter. 
(f)  Lighting. Parking areas of more than ten spaces shall be illuminated. Illumination of off-street parking areas shall be shielded so as not to project or reflect rays of light onto adjacent properties and so as not to create a traffic hazard on adjacent streets. The level of illumination shall be in accordance with section 56-266(f). 
(g)  Slope. Except for parking spaces accessory to a single-family detached dwelling, no area of any parking facility shall have a slope of more than five percent. No access ramp shall have a slope of more than eight percent. 
(h)  Maintenance. Except in the manufacturing district, no cleaning or maintenance of parking lots utilizing motorized equipment may be performed between 11:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. each day, except for snow removal.

Sec. 56-312. - Location of spaces. 
(a)  Yards. Off-street parking spaces may be provided in surface lots, below grade, beneath a building and, in those zoning districts where specifically allowed, in parking structures. Off-street parking spaces may be located in any yard, except required front yards, unless approved by the planning and zoning board of appeals. 
(b)  Off-site spaces and/or CBD district parking waivers. Parking spaces required for single-family or two-family dwelling units shall be located on the same lot as the dwelling served. Parking spaces required for all other uses, except uses in CBD district established after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, shall be located on the same lot as the use served. 
(1)  Within the CBD district, uses in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived which are subsequently altered or enlarged, and all new uses, may be served by parking facilities located on land other than the lot on which the use is located. Such facilities shall be located within 600 feet of the main entrance to the building being served. The building commissioner shall have the authority to waive the required parking spaces in the CBD district where it is determined that the use will be adequately served by public, or a combination of public and private, parking facilities. For all parking waivers, the building commissioner shall consider safety standards, future enforcement and sound traffic design. 
(2)  In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the use is located, the applicant shall be required to provide written documentation in the form of a letter of agreement from the property owner that controls the land where parking is proposed to be used. The letter shall, to the satisfaction of the planning and development director or planning and zoning board of appeals, ensure that the parking will serve the proposed use. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 11.4; Ord. No. 14-028, § 1, 8-19-2014) 
Sec. 56-313. - Shared parking. 
(a)  Standards. Off-street parking and loading facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements of each such use and if all regulations governing the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served are observed. However, no parking or loading space, or portion thereof, shall serve as the required space for more than one use, unless otherwise authorized in accordance with section 56-312. 
(b)  Procedures. The following shared-parking procedures shall be observed. 
(1)  The planning and zoning board of appeals may authorize a reduction in the total number of required parking or loading spaces for two or more uses jointly providing off-street parking when their respective hours of operation do not substantially overlap. The applicant shall provide sufficient data to indicate that there is not a substantial conflict in the principal hours of operation of the uses. 
(2)  The applicant shall submit a legal agreement guaranteeing that the parking spaces or loading spaces shall be maintained so long as the uses are in existence, unless the required parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with this article. The instrument shall be approved by the village attorney and shall be recorded with the recorder of deeds.

The number of accessible parking spaces shall be included in the total number of required parking spaces and shall be in accordance with the requirements of the state administrative code, as amended from time to time. 
(b)  Dimensions and design. Such spaces shall comply with the design standards presented in the state accessibility standards; provided that in no instance shall the width of any one space be less than 16 feet. Such spaces shall be identified by a sign and by pavement markings indicating parking for the handicapped only. Such spaces shall be the spaces closest to the entrance of the building or structure and shall be connected by a paved surface designed to provide safe and easy access. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 11.6) 
Sec. 56-315. - Stacking spaces for drive-through facilities. 
(a)  Required spaces. Every drive-through facility shall provide a minimum of six stacking spaces per facility, plus one space per waiting area provided.

Sec. 56-316. - Off-street loading. 
(a)  Required spaces.

The planning and zoning board of appeals may vary these requirements as provided in section 56-101. For uses not specified, off-street loading berths shall be provided based on the recommendations of the director of planning and development and approved by the planning and zoning board of appeals, taking into consideration requirements for similar uses. Any loading operation shall not create traffic congestion or traffic hazards on the public streets.

(c)  Signs adjacent to residential areas. Signs located on a lot abutting a residential district or a sign within 100 feet of any residentially-zoned area shall be so designed, located, shielded and directed as to prevent the casting of direct light upon adjacent properties or streets. 
(Ord. of 5-1-2003, § 13.5) 
Sec. 56-412. - Area computation. 
    The following principles shall control the computation of sign area: 
(1)  Individual signs. The area of a sign face shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle or triangle, or combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background or the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including, any supporting framework or bracing, unless such framework or bracing is made part of the message or face of the sign. See the illustrations (Figures 56-5 and 56-6) that follow. 
(2)  Multiple-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are no more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.

Sec. 56-422. - Master sign plan regulations. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The intent of permitting a master sign plan and associated regulations in lieu of the standards set forth in this article is to provide flexibility in the types, number and sign area requirements for individual signs permitted by this article in exchange for the development of an integrated, high quality master plan for signage for larger-scale developments and/or shopping districts. By no means is the master sign plan option to be a surrogate for the variation process, therefore no flexibility shall be granted to permit signs that are otherwise prohibited or to permit additional sign height and/or total sign area for all signs, than would otherwise be permitted for the development by this article. The master sign plan shall clearly set forth the maximum permitted sign area that would be permitted for all signs under this article for the entire development. Within that maximum permitted overall sign area for the entire development, the number, type and sign area of individual signs may be varied; provided they are designed in a coordinated manner. 
(b)  Authority. Planned developments, commercial shopping center, office/industrial parks, universities, colleges, medical centers, institutions having multibuilding campuses, or any association of merchants or building owners doing business within a specified area of the village, may establish a master sign plan and associated regulations for their property or district subject to review and approval by the planning and zoning board of appeals. Persons desiring to obtain approval of a master sign plan shall submit the coordinated sign plan and associated regulations/standards together with any additional material requested to the building commissioner. 
(c)  Review procedure. The planning and zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing in accordance with section 56-93 to review the proposed master sign plan and associated regulations/standards.
