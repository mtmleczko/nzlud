    This Republication constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Republication was the Village Code of 1955, as updated through December, 2000. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Articles may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Christopher J. Nelson, Assistant to Village Manager, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
    This republication was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice President for Supplements, and Janet Cramer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

Petitioner shall pay said amount to the Village Treasurer within five business days of notification by the Village of the amount of such initial deposit. 
B.  Second and subsequent deposits.

3.  Fees for towing and storage of a vehicle under this section shall be those approved by the Chief of Police for a tower authorized to tow for the Police Department. 
C.  Notice. Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by the Village. An exception to such towing of the vehicle shall apply when the owner or driver knowingly consents to the transfer of possession of the vehicle to a third party unless the vehicle is otherwise subject to seizure. The third party shall not be impaired in any manner and must evidence a valid driver's license and vehicle insurance to drive on the highways of the State of Illinois. Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, of the fact of the seizure of the vehicle and of owner's right to request a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing to be conducted under this section. Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearings provided for in subsection (d) herein, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the Village a cash bond in the amount of $500.00 and pays the towing and storage charges. 
D.  Preliminary hearing. If the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this section desires to appeal the seizure, said owner must make a request for said hearing within 24 hours of the seizure. Said request shall be in writing and filed with the chief of police or his designee who shall conduct such preliminary hearing within 24 hours after receipt of the request excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or Village holidays. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the Chief of Police or his designee determines there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the Village a cash bond in the amount of $500.00, and pays the tower any applicable towing and storage fees. If the chief of police or his designee determines that there is no such probable cause, the vehicle will be returned without fee or other fees. 
E.  Hearing. 
1.  The owner of a vehicle towed by or pursuant to the authority of the Hoffman Estates Police Department as set forth in this Section shall be provided the opportunity for a post-tow hearing to determine the validity of such tow and any tow or storage charges. This hearing will not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation issued relative to any towed vehicle. 
2.  The Village Manager shall designate one or more hearing officers to conduct post-tow hearings. The hearing officer shall have the authority to require the presence of the enforcement officer issuing the citation or any other Village personnel or witnesses at such hearing. 
3.  After a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the Village shall notify the owner of record by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a plea hearing that will be conducted, pursuant to this section. The owner may appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If the owner does not appear and evidence of notification is shown, then a finding of guilty will be entered. If a plea of guilty or finding of guilty is entered, the case will be disposed of at that time. If the owner pleads not guilty, a final hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the hearing officer as soon as practicable but no later than 45 days after the vehicle was seized. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably-prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. 
4.  The Hearing Officer shall review all evidence presented and make a finding as to whether there was lawful authority for the tow and storage of the vehicle. The Village must establish said authority by the preponderance of the evidence. The Village shall establish a prima facie case upon a showing of the documents related to the tow; i.e. the police citation or the police report and/or the tow report. The Chief of Police, through special order, shall establish procedures to authenticate and present the above documents at a tow hearing. 
5.  The Hearing Officer shall advise the owner of his findings at the conclusion of the hearing: 
a.  If the tow and storage is determined to be lawfully under authority pursuant to this Section and the owner shall be so informed and further advised of the amount owed, if any, for tow and storage. 
b.  If the tow and storage is determined to be not pursuant to this Section, the Hearing Officer shall so inform the owner; and 
1)  If the vehicle is impounded at the time of hearing, shall order the vehicle be immediately released; 
2)  If the vehicle has been released, advise the owner that a refund of the cash bond will be made within seven days. 
F.  Administrative fee. If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to this section, such fee shall constitute a debt due and owing to the Village. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond shall be applied to the fee. If a vehicle has been impounded when such a fee is imposed, the Village may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the fee is paid to the Village and any applicable towing and storage fees, are paid to the tower, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative fee and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after an administrative fee is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative fee and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of the Hearing Officer's determination may be sought, or within 30 days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the Village, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
G.  Vehicle possession. 
1.  Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien holder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until the administrative fee and fees applicable under this section have been paid.

A.  Definitions. For the purposes of this Section: 
1.  Adult. An adult is a person 18 years of age or older. 
2.  Harmful material. The term "harmful material" means material which the average person applying contemporary standards find its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to prurient interest that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal. The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall be judged with reference to average minors of the same general age of the minor to whom such material was sold, rented or exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its sale, rental or exhibition that it is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case, the predominant appeal of the material shall be judged with reference to its intended or probable recipient group. Where circumstances of sale, rental or exhibition indicate the material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal. The following material is presumed to contain harmful material but the presumption may be rebutted: 
a.  Material rated X by the Motion Picture Association of America; or 
b.  Material with any of the following designations: 
(1)  X-rated or X material;

4.  Material. The term material means any writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment. 
5.  Minor. A minor is a person under 18 years of age. 
6.  Peruse. The term peruse means to read, examine or view. 
7.  Promotional material. The term "promotional material" means any and all boxes, containers, brochures, leaflets, posters, wrappers, packaging or other material visually depicting harmful material. 
8.  Visual depiction. The term visual depiction means a representation consisting of pictures, photographs, drawings, slides, video, film or other visual medium. 
B.  No person having custody, control, supervision of, or employed in any commercial establishment open to minors shall knowingly sell, rent or exhibit harmful material to a minor. 
C.  A rebuttable presumption shall be made that harmful material has not been exhibited to a minor if: 
1.  A separate adult display area is maintained for such material which area: 
a.  A separate adult display area is maintained for such material which area: 
(1)  is enclosed in such a manner that material in the area is not visible from outside the area; and 
(2)  a sign is posted at the point of ingress prohibiting entry by minors, and further provided the material is not removed from the area without an opaque cover or other system which prevents exhibition of the material to a minor; or 
2.  The material is blocked from view by an opaque cover or other system which prevents exhibition to a minor, or 
3.  The material is kept out of public view and available only upon request by an adult. 
D.  Nothing contained herein shall prohibit any minor employee of a commercial establishment from handling a commercial transaction involving harmful material provided no visual depiction of harmful material is visible to the minor and provided the minor employee is not allowed to peruse harmful material. 
E.  Minor Falsifying Age. No minor shall falsify his or her age for the purpose of procuring harmful materials. Any person under 18 years of age who falsely states, either orally or in writing, that he is not under the age of 18 years, or who presents or offers to any person any evidence of age and identity which is false or not actually his own for the purpose of ordering, obtaining, viewing, or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or view any harmful material, shall be guilty of an offense under this Section.

B.  A copy of such notice shall be filed with the hearing officer as soon as practicable at the place and in the manner he or she shall from time to time direct. 
C.  Parties shall be served with notice in a manner reasonably calculated to give them actual notice, including, as appropriate, personal service notice upon a party or its employees or agents; service by first class mail at a party's address; or notice that is posted upon the property where the alleged violation is found when the party is the owner or manager of the property.

B.

C.  In any case in which a respondent has failed to comply with a judgment ordering a respondent to correct a code violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of a code violation, any expenses incurred by the Village to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or hearing officer, shall be a debt due and owing the Village and may be collected in accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a hearing officer pursuant to this subsection, the Village shall provide notice to the respondent that states the respondent shall appear at a hearing before the administrative hearing officer to determine whether the respondent has failed to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date for such a hearing, which shall not be less then seven days from the date that the notice is served. If notice is served by mail, the seven-day period shall begin to run on the date the notice was deposited in the mail. 
D.  Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Code of Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed in the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the respondent in the amount of any debt due and owing the Village under this Section. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
E.  The hearing officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set a new hearing date, upon a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance of the order of default, if the hearing officer determines that the petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time if the petitioner establishes that the Village did not provide proper service of notice. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this subsection, the hearing officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the Village as a result of the vacated default judgment.

4.  The notice shall state the particular location for which the variation is requested as well as a brief statement explaining the proposed variation. 
C.  Standards for Variations. 
1.  The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not recommend the variation of the regulations of the Code unless it shall first make a finding based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
a.  The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in the district in which it is located; 
b.  The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; 
c.  The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
2.  For the purpose of implementing the above rules, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall also, in making its determination whether there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into consideration the extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been established by the evidence[:] 
a.  The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out; 
b.  The conditions upon which the petition for a variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification; 
c.  The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the value of the property; 
d.  The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property; 
e.  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and 
f.  The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fires, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values in the neighborhood. 
3.  The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend to the Village Board that such conditions and restrictions be imposed upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and better to carry out the general intent of this Code. 
D.  Authorized Variations. Variations from the regulations of this Code may be recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission only in accordance with the standards set forth in this section and may be recommended in the following instances and others: 
1.  To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or setback required by the applicable regulations. 
2.  To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than 90 percent of the required area and width. 
3.  To permit exceptions to the height regulations imposed hereunder. 
E.  Vote Required. The concurring vote of a majority of the commission members in attendance, and a minimum of four favorable votes, shall be necessary to recommend any variations to the Village Board. 
F.  Action by the Village Board.

2.  Upon authorization by the Village Board to conduct a hearing for revocation of a granted variation, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a hearing to consider revocation of the variation. At this hearing the Planning and Zoning Commission will determine if the Standards for Variation outlined in Section 9-1-15-C are still present to justify the variation and forward their findings of fact and recommendation to the Village Board. If the Village Board denies a recommended revocation of a variation no further hearings regarding revocation of the variation shall be heard for a period of one year from the date of that decision. 
H.  Repealed. 
I.  Effect of Denial of Variation.

D.  It is recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot properly be classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location.

I.  Standards. No special use shall be recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless said Planning and Zoning Commission shall find: 
1.  That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare;

J.  Conditions and Guarantees. 
1.  Prior to the granting of any special use the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend, and the Village Board shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the special use as deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in Section 9-1-18-I. 
2.  In all cases in which special uses are granted, the Village Board shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being, and will be, complied with. 
K.  Effect of Denial of a Special Use.

Sec. 10-2-1. - Development Review Administration. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. The purpose of this Code is to promote the health, safety, enjoyment, and general welfare of the public and conserve or enhance the taxable value of land and buildings throughout the Village. The provisions of this Code shall be administered to ensure orderly growth and development and shall supplement and facilitate the provisions in the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Code and other chapters of the Municipal Code. 
B.  Jurisdiction and Scope of Regulations. The owner of any parcel of land, building or tenant space within a building desiring to develop or redevelop such parcel, building or tenant space within a building shall submit development plans (site plan and/or plat of subdivision) and supporting documents for review in accordance with the provisions of this Code. Any structure, building, improvement, land subdivision, or other development within the Village permitted by the Zoning Code, including any and all exterior or interior additions, alterations, changes, and/or relocations of existing buildings, or any changes in the specific use of the building occurring hereafter shall require development review and shall be subject to all regulations of this Code. Site improvements required of any portion of a multi-tenant property under common ownership (such as a shopping center), shall be proportionate to the size of the developed or redeveloped tenant space relative to the whole ownership and such improvements may be deferred until such time as a grouping of improvements may be constructed, subject to and in accordance with approval by the Village and shall be implemented through the construction of site improvements within 18 months of the plan approval, or as otherwise approved by the Village Board. The Village Board may grant a single extension of time for a period of 12 months. All changes as outlined above to a site plan, plat, building, use or other significant aspects of an existing Village plan or plat approval shall be subject to approval by the Village as provided for in this Code. 
C.  Interpretation. 
1.  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Code shall be held to be minimum requirements under the police power as enacted in this Code and conformance without further legislative review shall not create any entitlement to the proposed use of the property. The Village Board may further exercise their discretion in a legislative review of submitted development plans and supporting documents in a reasonable manner for the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare. 
2.  Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this Code upon the use of land or buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of this Code or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, including the Village's Comprehensive Plan, the regulations which are more restrictive (or which impose higher standards or requirements) shall govern. 
3.  This Code is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this Code are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) than such easements, covenants or other private agreements, the requirements of this Code shall govern. 
D.  Periodic Redevelopment of Commercial Properties. For any non-residential building or property, where more than 15 years has elapsed since the site was initially developed, or wholly and substantially redeveloped, and such building or property is not in compliance with current Village Code requirements, a site plan shall be developed to update the site and building to meet current Village Code requirements to the extent feasible in consideration of the existing improvements present on the site. Upon written notification by the Village of the foregoing requirement, the owner shall have one year to develop a site plan in accordance with the above. Upon approval by the Village of the site plan, the plan shall be implemented through the construction of site improvements within two years of the plan approval. 
E.  Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission of the Village of Hoffman Estates, in addition to its powers and duties as prescribed by the Hoffman Estates Municipal Code, and other ordinances of the Village and State Statutes, shall hear and act upon all development review (site plan and/or plat of subdivision) applications approval in the manner and subject to the standards prescribed herein and shall report its findings and recommendations to the Village Board. 
F.  Exception of Specific Requirements. The Planning and Zoning Commission, when acting upon any development review applications approval, shall have the power to recommend exceptions from the applicable requirements as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the provisions for approval of this Code, if the literal enforcement of one or more provisions of the Code is impractical or will exact undue hardship because of unique conditions pertaining to the land in question. When such exceptions are recommended, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall transmit such recommendations in a Finding of Fact to the Village Board for their consideration and final action. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-2-2. - Development review procedures (preliminary and final). 
    This section is established to delineate procedures for review of development applications, which consist of site plan, and/or plat of subdivision applications. Procedures contained herein are intended to provide orderly and expeditious processing of such applications. 
A.  Pre-Application Review. Applicants for development review may request a preapplication review conference and application packet. Upon such request, the Department of Development Services shall coordinate a preapplication review conference to allow the applicant to confer with appropriate Village representatives responsible for development review in order to: 
1.  Discuss the feasibility of the proposed project in relation to the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Code, etc., and 
2.  Become familiar with requirements and procedures associated with the development review process. 
Subsequent to conferring with Village representatives, application documents and materials shall be submitted in accordance with this Subdivision Code and summarized in the Department of Development Services Review Process document. 
B.  Courtesy Presentation. At their option, applicants for development review may appear before the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee of the Village Board to make a courtesy presentation of a proposed project. Expert witnesses, exhibits, etc., are not required as the appearance is only intended to provide a general overview of the proposed project. Such presentations shall not constitute a review by the Village Board and any direction to proceed to development review before the Planning and Zoning Commission shall not be construed as any indication of future project approval by the Village Board. An application to appear before the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements as established in the Department of Development Services Procedures for courtesy presentation. 
C.  Filing of Application Documents. The applicant shall submit an application for development review to the Village's Department of Development Services in such number as may be from time to time requested by such Department. The application and supporting documents to be submitted are intended to provide the Planning and Zoning Commission with information and data to assure compliance with all municipal codes and specifications and ensure that the proposed development meets the design, improvement, and operation standards contained within this Code. Documents to be submitted are based on the particular stage of the development application, and shall conform to the list of required documents to be submitted as specified in the Development Services Department Development Review Process document. 
Copies of the application, development plans, all supporting documents, and payment of the required application fee shall be filed with the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services in accordance with the specifications and procedures of the Department of Development Services. Within 21 days of the Village's receipt of the application, development plans, all supporting documents, and payment of the required application fee, the Village's Assistant Village Manager-Development Services shall use best efforts to submit a written report to the applicant identifying whether the proposed development conforms with zoning, planning, engineering and other standards and identifying specifically those items which do not satisfy such standards. The applicant shall work with the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services to correct any item identified in the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services' written report as not conforming with the zoning, planning, engineering and other standards. All development plans and supporting documents shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements as established in the Subdivision Code. 
An engineering plan shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements as established in the Subdivision Code and the Transportation and Engineering Division's Development Requirements and Standards Manual as part of all development review applications. 
A landscape plan shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Subdivision Code (including Article 4) as part of all development review applications. 
D.  Planning and Zoning Commission Schedule. Upon submittal of a development application, including a conceptual plan or plat (or more detailed plans and supporting documentation as may be provided by the petitioner) the application shall be placed on the Planning and Zoning Commission's agenda in chronological order. 
Applications  remanded to the Planning and Zoning Commission by the Village Board shall have priority status and be placed on the next agenda opening pending completion of revised application materials. If, at any time, a substantial change is made in the application, at any stage of the process, the application shall be considered as a new application under this section. 
E.  Preliminary Review. The development review process shall consist of a two-step procedure consisting of preliminary review and final review. Application materials, development plans, and supporting documents for preliminary review shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements specified in Article 6 (Development Plan Documents). Preliminary review generally will require elements of a more general nature, in particular, engineering plan documents. 
The applicant may, at their option, request preliminary concept approval (being a form of preliminary review which is less than a complete preliminary review and which does not substitute for the required complete preliminary review) by submitting such application materials, development plans, and supporting documents as are determined necessary to provide a general understanding of the proposed project, with the development rights granted under any action on the request being limited in scope by the submitted materials, plans and documents presented, and by any conditions of approval as may be applied by the Village. 
F.  Final Review. Upon preliminary approval by the Village Board, the applicant may proceed to prepare final documents in accordance with the general layout, conditions of approval, etc., identified during preliminary review. The applicant shall have twelve months to prepare and submit final documents to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
    Upon preliminary approval by the Village Board, failure to submit final documents or obtain an extension of preliminary approval shall result in the preliminary application being declared null and void. The Village Board may grant a single extension of preliminary approval for a period of 12 months. 
    Application materials, development plans, and supporting documents for final review shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements specified in Article 6 (Development Plan Documents). All requirements of this Code and other applicable Codes and requirements shall be completed documenting the exact plans to be used during the construction of the development. 
G.  Concurrent Preliminary and Final Review. Upon the request of the applicant, the Planning and Zoning Commission may consider concurrent preliminary and final review, subject to the requirements of this Article. 
H.  Planning and Zoning Commission Review and Recommendation. The Assistant Village Manager-Development Services shall transmit copies of the development application and supporting documents to the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration. The Department of Development Services shall notify adjacent property owners and each applicant shall post appropriate notification signs on the subject property in accordance with applicable Village requirements. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall conduct a review of each application and supporting documents in accordance with the standards of this Subdivision Code and the Development Services Department Development Review Process document. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall use its best efforts to conclude its review of the application and supporting documents and report its findings to the Village Board within 45 days of the first meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission held for the applicant. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval, approval with modification, or disapproval and state their reason. However, no action shall be taken by the Planning and Zoning Commission based upon new or significantly altered plans or other application materials presented to them that have not been first reviewed by Village Staff. 
I.  Village Board Action. All decisions and findings of the Planning and Zoning Commission regarding development applications after public hearing/meeting shall in all instances be referred to the Village Board with a report (containing findings of fact) and recommendations. In no case shall the Planning and Zoning Commission refer an application to the Village Board prior to having received and reviewed all plans and supporting documents. 
    The Village Board shall use its best efforts to approve, approve with modifications, or deny such application or, remand the application back to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further consideration within 30 days of receipt of the Planning and Zoning Commission's findings. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article to the contrary, within 105 days of the determination by the Village's Assistant Village Manager-Development Services that the proposed development conforms with the zoning, planning, engineering, and other standards (including, but not limited to, IDOT, MWRD, IDNR/OWR, etc., as these standards may be provided within the allotted time by the appropriate agency), the Village shall approve, deny, or remand the application. The Village shall take all reasonable actions necessary (including but not limited to the scheduling of meetings and review, by and before the Planning and Zoning Commission, Village Board, Village staff or departments) to comply with such 105-day deadline. Approval shall be effective for a period of twelve months unless the Village Board grants a modification. If a final development application has not been approved within this time limit, a new preliminary development application shall be submitted. 
    All elements of the approval application, including but not limited to, all plans, submittal documents, specifications, project operation descriptions, and all conditions of approval shall be substantially complied with during initial construction, and during the occupancy and use of the site or facility, and during any vacancies of the site or facility. The Village shall have the right to require compliance with the approved plans and documents and to inspect properties for compliance on a periodic basis. 
J.  Effect of Denial of an Application. No application for development approval which has been denied wholly or in part by the Village Board shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of said order of denial, except on the grounds of substantial new evidence, proof of changed conditions, or significant alterations in the petition found to be valid by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Village Board. 
K.  Submittal and Recording of a Final Plat of Subdivision. 
1.  For the final plat of subdivision, the original plat document shall be submitted to the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services prior to Village Board review, and held until such time as it is ready to be recorded. The final plat shall contain all required signatures other than the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission and Village Board. Evidence of the payment of the previous year's real estate tax bills shall be submitted with the original plat document. 
2.  Upon approval of a final plat of subdivision, the signatures of the Village President, Village Clerk, and Planning and Zoning Commission Chairman and secretary shall be affixed to the original plat document prior to recordation. 
3.  When all requirements have been met, the Village Clerk shall record said final plat document with the County Recorder. After the plat has been recorded, a reproducible copy shall be kept on file with the Village Clerk. 
L.  Revocation. Upon Village Board approval of a final development application, the applicant shall have twelve months to obtain a building permit. Extensions of time may be granted by the Village Board for periods of six months. Failure to obtain a building permit or obtain an extension shall result in the final application being declared null and void. 
M.  Amendments to Approved Applications. Amendments to approved development applications shall be reviewed by the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services, who shall determine whether the changes are "staff level", "administrative", "minor" or "major". 
Staff level changes shall be reviewed by Department of Development Services staff for compliance with all code requirements and shall be limited to non-significant impact alterations to an approved site plan, such as a change in species of plant material, minor adjustment in building materials, the addition of outdoor seating at a restaurant where there is no negative impact on parking or pedestrian access, addition of a dumpster or utility screen, or other minimal changes that do not materially affect the operational impacts or aesthetics of an approved site plan. Such changes may be approved by consent of the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services, or through the issuance of a building permit, where necessary. 
Administrative site plan amendments shall be limited to the addition of landscaping and other changes to the site plan that meet or exceed current Code requirements where feasible in consideration of the existing improvements present on the site, and where a maximum increase to the gross building floor area would be not more than 20 percent of the existing gross floor area. An administrative site plan amendment may be granted if the above changes, on a long-term basis, will not substantially increase traffic to the location, the amount of noise, artificial light or other impacts. Such administrative site plan amendments may be approved by the Village Manager, following review procedures established by the Village[.] 
Minor amendments to previously approved applications shall be acted upon by the Village Board, after review and recommendation by the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee, who shall receive a recommendation from the Department of Development Services for consideration and final action on such amendments. 
Major amendments to previously approved applications shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures and requirements for development review (by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Village Board) as specified in this Code. Application materials associated with a pre-application conference shall be submitted in accordance with the Department of Development Services Procedures for Amendments to Approved Development Applications. The Assistant Village Manager-Development Services may recommend to the Planning and Zoning Commission that the requirements for specific application materials be waived where submission of the document is not deemed to be warranted to ensure proper review and shall inform the Chair of the Planning and Zoning Commission of the waiver request. 
N.  Certificates of Correction for Plats of Subdivision. Certificates of Correction for changes to recorded plats of subdivision shall be reviewed in accordance with specific procedures provided by the Department of Development Services. 
Certificates of Correction shall obtain Village approval prior to recordation. The Assistant Village Manager-Development Services shall determine whether the subdivision alteration is "minor" or "major". Minor changes shall be approved by the Village Board as certificates of correction, while major changes shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by the Village Board. Major changes to plats of subdivision may necessitate submittal of a revised plat of subdivision, as determined necessary by the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services. 
O.  Statement of Awareness. A "Statement of Awareness" required by the Village Board as a condition of approval of a Plat of Subdivision may be recorded or registered with the recorder or the Registrar of Titles against all property described in the Plat of Subdivision in the same manner as a deed or other document relating to the title of real estate. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13; Ord. No. 4521-2015, §§ 3-5, 12-21-15) 
ARTICLE 3. - LAND IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 10-3-1. - Land improvements. 
    Improvements to be constructed to serve the approved site and/or subdivision shall be in accordance with the requirements of this Article and satisfactory assurance of the completion of the improvements shall be furnished or caused to be furnished to the Village Board by the developers or owners. Plans and specifications covering the construction of the improvements as required herein shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer of the State of Illinois. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-3-2. - Public and private street design and regulations. 
A.  General Provisions. 
1.  Public streets as defined in Section 10-1-3 shall be designed and improved in accordance with the requirements noted herein and of the governmental body having jurisdiction of such streets. For Village streets, this would include the Village of Hoffman Estates Development Requirements and Standards Manual, Municipal Code, and Standard Specifications. Private streets shall meet all applicable requirements of public streets, and shall be privately maintained. 
2.  Public Street Rights-of-Way and Roadway Requirements. All rights-of-way and streets shall be subject to the following requirements and shall be improved with paved roadways to an overall width, measured from back to back of curb, in accordance with the following minimum dimensions. Final proposed roadway width may be modified by the Village Board based on the anticipated use of the road. 
3.  Deviation from the approved standards may be approved if evidence is submitted that the proposed design is in accordance with street and highway geometric design criteria in latest standards of the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), with the approval of the Village Engineer. 
4.  Streets shall be related appropriately to the proposed topography. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the topography consistent with provision of adequate sight distance. Topography permitting, a combination of steep grade curves shall be avoided. 
5.  Local (minor) streets shall be designed so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
6.  Alleys are not permitted except where deemed necessary by the Village Board to serve non-residential areas. 
7.  Street design shall be in accordance with current accepted Complete Streets principles and should reflect the needs and capabilities of all users and appropriate design vehicles, including passenger cars, trucks, buses, public transit, parking/loading, pedestrians, and bicyclists. 
8.  The physical and visible features of the street shall accommodate and communicate the intended operating conditions of the street. The context of each street within a development, Village and region in general shall be taken into account in street design. The Village Board shall have the authority to require features and elements of a street to be greater than the minimum standards based on the context of each street. 
B.  Street and Roadway Planning. There shall be no specific rule regarding the layout of streets and blocks, however, the following shall apply to all streets, blocks and development of any property in the Village. 
1.  Connectivity to the existing transportation network for all users shall be considered when new streets are designed or when existing streets are reconstructed, resurfaced, or modified. 
2.  Block design must consider lot planning, vehicle traffic flows, pedestrian and bicyclists, transit operations, and public areas. Where appropriate or necessary for circulation and/or compatible uses, public rights-of-way shall provide for safe, efficient movements and access to future rights-of-way and adjacent parcels. 
3.  Block lengths shall not exceed a maximum 1,000 feet in length without an intervening street, however, an ideal length should be approximately 600 to 800 feet. In unique circumstances the Village Board may consider longer block lengths as long as an intervening pedestrian way is provided near the mid-block point to afford convenient access to schools, parks, transit, and throughout the neighborhood in general. In determining block length, consideration shall be given to intersection spacing and design criteria. 
4.  Local streets within a neighborhood shall be designed to discourage use by vehicles whose trips do not originate or end within the same or an adjacent neighborhood. 
5.  Street classification shall be determined by the Village Board based on the intended function of each street within the Village's street network, and shall consider anticipated traffic volumes, connectivity to other streets, adjacent land uses, access, and other factors. The following shall generally apply: 
Functional Classification Design Speed Local (Minor) Street 20 to 25 mph Collector Street 25 to 35 mph Arterial Street >35 mph  
6.  Street design shall provide adequate stopping sight distance in accordance with current transportation engineering standards. 
7.  Street design shall consider adequate passing sight distance where appropriate, in accordance with current transportation engineering standards. 
8.  Street design shall consider adequate sight distance at public street intersections, public driveways, and private driveways, in accordance with this code and current transportation engineering standards. 
9.  Design Controls applicable to street design include sight distance along the road and at intersections, design speed, design vehicle, and functional classification of the street. These design controls individually and in combination with the street planning principles will determine the horizontal and vertical alignments, travelled way and roadside features, intersection design, location and design of access, pedestrian and bicycle accommodations, among other street design elements. 
10.  Cul-de-sacs shall only be permitted when there is a practical difficulty in the design of the subdivision without the cul-de-sac and where snow operations are not substantially affected by cost of snow removal, snow storage, or difficulty of snow removal. 
11.  The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be 700 feet measured along the center line from the intersection at origin to the center of the turnaround area. Each cul-de-sac shall have a paved turnaround area having a minimum diameter of 80 feet. Each cul-de-sac shall have a terminus of nearly circular shape, which may be offset with a minimum R.O.W. diameter of 100 feet for public streets. 
12.  Street names shall require approval by the Village. No street names shall be used which will duplicate, or be confused with, the names of existing streets in the Village or in the areas of contiguous Fire Districts or Fire Departments. 
13.  Right of way widths for public streets are shown below. These values are also applicable to private streets intended to function as public streets. Additional right of way width may be required at intersections or other areas, as determined by the Village for functional purposes. 
Local (Minor) Street Collector Street Arterial Street Minimum width of right-of-way for public streets 66 feet 1 80 feet 100 feet  
1 Where a Local Street is adjacent to detached single-family lots zoned R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5 or R-6, rights-of-way a minimum of 60 feet in width may be approved by the Village Board only if all public and private improvements, utilities, snow storage areas, etc. can be located and installed in accordance with Village and utility provider requirements. In some instances, utility ducts may be required due to space limitations. 
C.  Alignment. 
1.  The combination of horizontal and vertical elements of street segments influences operation and performance of streets. The street alignment in residential areas should closely fit with the existing topography to minimize the need for cuts or fills while considering the crash frequency and severity potential for vehicles that run off the road. The function of local streets in residential areas is to provide land access, and therefore these streets should be designed to discourage through traffic. Street alignment in commercial and industrial areas should be commensurate with the topography but should be as direct as practical. 
2.  Horizontal Alignment 
a.  The planning and layout of streets shall give consideration to the length of tangent sections with the goal of achieving operating speeds consistent with the intended function of the street. Between reverse horizontal curves, the minimum tangent length shall be as shown or as dictated by superelevation design requirements. Long extended tangent sections of street should be avoided as a means to limit operating speeds for vehicle traffic. 
Local (Minor) Street Collector Street Arterial Street Minimum length of tangent between reverse curves 50' 150' 250'  
b.  Curve radii shall be consistent with current transportation engineering design practice based on the design speed of the street and the intended operating speed. The minimum horizontal curve radii by street classification are shown below. For design speeds different than those listed in the functional classification table, the IDOT Bureau of Local Roads Manual and the AASHTO Geometric Design of Highways and Streets guide can be referenced. 
Design Speed Minimum Centerline Radius (feet) 20 mph 95' 25 mph 180' 30 mph 300' 35 mph 465' 40 mph 675' 45 mph 945'  
Table Note: The values in the table above assume a normal crown section of 2 percent with no superelevation. For curves with the normal crown removed or where superelevation is used, other minimum centerline radii will apply. See IDOT Bureau of Local Roads Manual and AASHTO Geometric Design of Highways and Streets for additional guidance. 
c.  Superelevation is typically not used on local and collector streets, however, if used, the superelevation rate shall not exceed 4 percent. 
d.  Horizontal curves, especially those of minimum radii, should not be placed at the end of long tangent sections of street nor be hidden by vertical features of the road alignment or roadside. 
3.  Vertical Alignment 
a.  Grades for local residential streets should be as level as practical, consistent with the surrounding terrain. 
b.  Longitudinal Grade 
1)  The minimum longitudinal grade shall be what is required for adequate drainage or 0.5 percent, whichever is greatest. 
2)  The maximum longitudinal grade shall be what is required for operations. The maximum longitudinal grade shall be 7 percent for local streets and 5 percent for collector or arterial streets. 
3)  Where adjacent sidewalks are present, a maximum longitudinal grade of 5 percent is recommended. 
4)  The maximum longitudinal grade shall not exceed 2 percent within 50 feet of a public or private intersection measured from edge of pavement of intersecting street. Vertical curves cannot be provided within this distance. 
c.  The minimum vertical clearance shall be adequate to accommodate design vehicles at bridges, structures, traffic signals, and other vertical elements. 
d.  Vertical curves - The design of vertical curves is based on the design speed of the road and the algebraic difference between longitudinal approach grades. Design standards such as the IDOT Bureau of Local Roads Manual reference "k" values for crest and sag vertical curves depending on design speed to determine the length. State and national design guidelines provide details on these values but for reference the table below can be used. 
Design Speed Minimum Length of Vertical Curve (feet) 20 mph 60' 25 mph 75' 30 mph 90' 35 mph 105' 40 mph 120' 45 mph 135'  
e.  The minimum length of a vertical curve should be equal to 3 times the design speed. Where the algebraic difference between approach grades is 0.6 percent or less, an angle point can be used with no vertical curve required. 
4.  Coordination of Horizontal and Vertical Alignments - The development of the horizontal and vertical features of the street shall take into consideration the combined effects on sight distance, drainage, driver expectancy, and intersection design. The combination of design features shall not limit or obscure visibility such as a horizontal curve following a crest vertical curve or an intersection being located in such a way that a horizontal or vertical curve restricts sight distance. 
D.  Elements within the Street Right of Way. 
1.  Travelled Way 
a.  The travelled way consists of the area used for the movement of vehicles, including lanes defined by pavement markings. The number of travelled lanes will be based on accepted transportation engineering practice considering factors such as functional classification, safety, and capacity. 
b.  The width measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement for a typical local street shall be 24 feet. With B6.12 curb and gutter, the back of curb to back of curb dimension is 27 feet. On-street parking is typically allowed on one side of a local street. 
c.  The width measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement for a typical collector street shall be 34 feet. With B6.12 curb and gutter, the back of curb to back of curb dimension is 37 feet. On-street parking is typically allowed on both sides of a collector street. 
d.  The width of arterial streets shall be based on the number and types of lanes, medians, and other features of the travelled way. On-street parking will be determined on a case by case basis. 
e.  The cross slope of the travelled way in the normal crown section shall be 2 percent. 
f.  Lane widths, where designated by pavement striping, may vary from 10 to 12 feet as determined by the Village. The type of lane (turning, through, etc.), the amount of truck traffic, design speed, pedestrian accommodations, bicycle accommodations, among other factors will be considered in the determination of an appropriate lane width. 
g.  The need for designated left turn lanes and right turn lanes will be determined based on the through and turning traffic volumes, the classification of the street, design speed, sight distance, and other factors as appropriate. 
h.  The length of turn lanes will be based on the findings of a traffic study prepared by a qualified traffic engineering professional as approved by the Village. A minimum length of 50 feet with tapers and transitions as defined by the IDOT Local Roads Manual and the AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets shall be used. 
i.  Parking. Where parking is permitted on a street, the following shall apply. 
1)  Parking lane widths. A typical parallel on-street parking lane width is a minimum of 8 feet measured from the face of the curb. Parking lanes may be striped in some situations to delineate the parking lane and the travel lane. 
2)  Per the Illinois Vehicle Code, parking is prohibited within 20 feet of a crosswalk. 
3)  Consideration should be given to the appropriateness of parking in proximity to parks, schools, churches, and other similar land uses that may experience a higher than typical pedestrian usage. Parking is typically prohibited on the side of the street adjacent to parks, school grounds, and other areas with high pedestrian activity. 
4)  Where on-street parking is permitted for streets where bicycle facilities are present, the parking design shall accommodate all requirements of bicycle facility design section of this code. 
5)  In some instances, on-street head-in or back-in angle parking may be considered. This determination will be made by the Village on a case by case basis. When used, the parking angle shall typically be 60 degrees. Also when used, consideration may be given to providing a buffer between the end of the angle parking stalls and edge of the traveled way to provide space for backing and bicycle use. 
j.  No speed bump or other such obstruction shall be constructed, placed or maintained on any private or public street or any other paved area within the Village. 
k.  The use of speed humps, split speed humps, raised intersections, speed tables, chicanes, diverters, neighborhood traffic circles or other features on any private or public street, or any other paved area within the Village shall be determined on a case by case basis by the Village Board through the Site Plan process. Review of any such features shall consider physical impacts on all road users, short and long term maintenance requirements, emergency vehicle access, snow plowing operations, and the potential benefits of the feature as compared to the potential impacts. 
2.  Edge of Travelled Way Treatments. 
a.  Curb and gutter. Combination concrete curb and gutter shall be provided on all streets. Concrete used for curb and gutter construction shall meet standard specifications. Vertical faced barrier curb (B6.12) is typically required on Village streets. In some cases, mountable (M3.12) curb may be allowed as determined by the Village. 
b.  Shoulders, where used in a rural cross section, shall be paved. A minimum width of 4 feet is desired. Aggregate and turf shoulders are discouraged for maintenance reasons. Shoulders are considered to be part of the clear zone dimension. 
c.  The slope of the shoulder should generally be away from the travelled way in tangent sections. Within horizontal curves, shoulder design will be performed on a case by case basis to ensure adequate drainage as well as accommodation for vehicles and other users. 
3.  Roadside Design. 
a.  Roadside slopes on streets with rural cross sections should generally be 4:1 or flatter (Horizontal:Vertical). 
b.  The AASHTO Roadside Design Guide may be referenced for details on the need for barriers; barrier type, location, and design; and other features of the roadside. 
c.  Clear Zone and barriers. On all streets, a minimum clear zone of 1.5 feet should be provided between the curb face and obstructions in the roadside such as utility poles, light poles, and fire hydrants. Barrier curb and gutter (B6.12) shall be used on all edges of pavement for the roadside and median unless otherwise approved. 
d.  At intersections or driveways, the minimum lateral offset to obstructions should be 3 feet from the face of curb to accommodate the overhang requirements of turning vehicles. Appropriate turning vehicle templates should be used to verify the lateral offset to features of the roadside that may conflict with the turning vehicle's overhang. 
e.  Guardrail is not typically used on local streets except where there is a significant risk to motorists and pedestrians, such as along sections with steep foreslopes and at approaches to overcrossing structures. 
f.  On facilities without a curb and with a shoulder width less than 4 feet, a minimum clear zone of 4 feet from the edge of the traveled way should be provided. The following shall apply. 
1)  Parkway should be of a sufficient width to accommodate specific width for proper utility placement in accordance with Standards Manual and as per direction of the Department of Public Works. 
2)  Consideration should be given to placement of trees, utility poles, mailboxes, signs, light poles, fire hydrants, and other obstructions/improvements so they are located outside of the clear zone[.] 
3)  Snow storage areas should be designed to take into account typical plowing operations, including locations of traffic control sign posts, fire hydrants, street lights, drainage patterns from snow melt, impact on intersection sight distance, pedestrian paths, etc. 
g.  Pedestrian Facilities. 
1)  Concrete sidewalks shall be provided throughout subdivisions on both sides of the street and along intersecting street frontages to promote connectivity and serve the anticipated needs of pedestrians. Such walks, both public and private, shall be located in accordance with proper land planning procedures and with due regard for public safety and anticipated concentration of pedestrian and bicycle traffic and shall comply with all applicable accessibility requirements. Maximum separation shall be provided between sidewalks and vehicular travel areas. Sidewalks along minor streets shall be constructed to meet Standard Specifications to a width of not less than five feet in both residential and non-residential areas. 
2)  Sidewalks shall be a minimum of 5 feet in width. Additional width, up to 8 feet or greater, shall be required in commercial areas depending on the specific characteristics of the development environment. Public Right of Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) should be referenced to determine appropriate design. Additional sidewalk width in excess of 5 feet may also be provided in the vicinity of transit stops or where groups of pedestrians may cross a street. 
3)  Sidewalk should be located one foot inside the right of way line unless otherwise approved by the Village. 
4)  Sidewalk connections shall be provided to the curb and other waiting areas where transit stops are currently located or may be positioned in the future. 
5)  Sidewalks shall be kept clear of obstructions, including street furniture, poles, manholes, structures, and adjacent landscaping. If approved by the Village, some manholes for utilities may be located in the sidewalk but this is generally not a preferred location[.] 
6)  The design of all sidewalks shall meet all Federal and State accessibility requirements. 
7)  Truncated domes used in accessibility ramps shall meet requirements of the Standards Manual. 
8)  A pedestrian crossing should be provided at all intersections and at midblock locations where it is determined that significant pedestrian activity can be expected. Special treatments to raise awareness of the crossing include warning signs, flashing beacons, rectangular rapid flash beacons, in pavement signs, and other options as approved by the Village. 
9)  Pedestrian crossings at signalized intersections shall be equipped with countdown timers, pedestrian actuation buttons, and appropriate signing. 
10)  Sidewalks shall be designed to accommodate pedestrians as the primary user, however, use of sidewalks by bicycles, skateboards, non-motorized scooters, etc. shall be subject to all applicable regulations and laws. 
h.  Bicycle Facilities 
1)  Bicycle facilities shall be provided and designed in accordance with the Village's Comprehensive Bicycle Plan and as required by the Village Board. The bicycle plan identifies locations of on-street and off-street bicycle facilities by type. 
2)  Both on-street and off-street bicycle accommodations may be evaluated to determine the most appropriate facility type. 
3)  The Northwest Municipal Conference (NWMC) regional bicycle plan identifies various corridors serving the area. The NWMC Regional Bicycle Corridor Plan should be consulted when determining if specific connections and accommodations should be made for bicyclists. 
4)  The criteria for the design of on-street and off-street bicycle facilities are found in the current edition of the AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities. 
5)  Consideration should be given to bicycle detection at signalized intersections on designated bicycle facilities and as determined by the Village. 
6)  Bicycle parking is discussed in Article 5 of this chapter. Some aspects of bicycle parking design may apply to the public right of way or public facilities. 
7)  Bicycle paths shall be designed to accommodate bicyclists as the primary user, however, use of bike paths by pedestrians, skateboards, non-motorized scooters, etc. shall be subject to all applicable regulations and laws. 
i.  Bus and other Transit Stops 
1)  Determination of the location of transit stops should be made in consultation with the appropriate transit agency. The PACE Transit Development Guide provides information on the size of the design vehicle, requirements for turning space, criteria for location and design of bus stops, and pedestrian accommodations, among other items. 
2)  Typical street widths and curb radii should be adequate to accommodate school buses. The appropriate School District should be contacted when needed. As school bus routes and stop locations can vary from year to year, street designs that provide adequate accommodations at all public street intersections should minimize the need for changes. 
3)  Coordination with Pace and other transit agencies should occur to assist in determining the need for transit accommodations. 
4)  Planning - The planning and layout of the street network, lot configuration, and block spacing should give consideration to promote accommodations for transit users. This includes connectivity between residential areas and adjacent collector and arterial streets for pedestrians. 
4.  Medians. The median of a roadway serves to separate traffic traveling in opposite directions. The median may be striped with pavement markings or may consist of either mountable or barrier curb along its edge with the traveled way 
a.  Medians are applicable in some instances to collector and arterial streets. The Village shall determine the locations of medians. Coordination with other agencies will be required for median types and designs on streets under the jurisdiction of others. 
b.  The median may be designated for use as a left turn lane as determined by the Village. 
c.  Between intersections, the median may be striped with pavement markings to function as a two-way left turn lane as determined by the Village. 
d.  Center roadway medians shall be used on public and private streets and drive aisles as determined appropriate by the Village Board through the site plan review process. 
e.  Raised median landscape (barrier curb) design shall provide for a minimum back-of-curb to back-of-curb dimension of six (6) feet where adjacent to turn lanes and a minimum of eight (8) feet where adjacent to through travel lanes. Such median area shall be landscaped with turf and shade trees as approved by the Village. 
f.  Pedestrian refuge area - the median width shall be a minimum of 6 feet to function as a pedestrian refuge. Detectable warnings shall be used as required by State and Federal standards. 
g.  On collector and arterial streets with raised curb medians, openings should be provided only at intersections with other streets and at reasonably spaced driveways serving major traffic generators. Median openings should be located only where there is adequate sight distance. 
h.  The design of collector and arterial streets with raised-curb medians should include drainage systems with drainage inlets and catch basins. 
E.  Traffic Control Markings and Signage. 
1.  All traffic control signs, pavement markings, and traffic signals shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Consistent and uniform application of traffic control devices is important. Details of the standard devices and warrants for many conditions are found in the MUTCD. 
2.  Geometric design of streets should consider treatments to minimize the number of traffic controls and regulations needed. 
3.  Street name signs of a design to be approved by the Village Board shall be erected so as to identify every street within the subdivision, and at the developer's cost. Such signs will conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Signs damaged during construction of a subdivision shall be replaced at developer's cost. Traffic control signs, other than street name signs, shall be provided and maintained by the developer when the subdivision is open to public access, as determined by the Village. 
4.  Pavement markings shall be in accordance with Standards Manual. 
5.  Utilization of signage and pavement markings to restrict turning movements at intersections and driveways are generally discouraged. It is preferred that access control be achieved through appropriate design methods. In situations where it is necessary to restrict turning movements for safety or operational reasons, as determined by the Village, the use of physical and traffic control measures may be permitted. Time of day and day of week limits on turning movements may be appropriate in certain situations, as determined by the Village. 
F.  Intersections. 
1.  Intersection design criteria. 
a.  Intersection spacing shall conform to block length requirements. 
b.  Intersections with an offset less than 125 measured between centerlines shall be prohibited. Greater offsets may be required for collector and arterial streets to accommodate turn lanes, however offset intersections are generally discouraged. 
c.  Intersection angles of 90 degrees are recommended. This applies to public and private street intersections as well as driveways. The alignment design should be adjusted to avoid an angle of intersection of less than 70 degrees[.] 
d.  Channeling islands may be needed to define excess pavement space and to delineate appropriate turning paths. 
2.  Sight Distance. The visibility at a street or driveway intersection is measured along the through roadway to provide drivers an opportunity to see traffic on the major street for completing crossing or turning maneuvers. Intersections, including median openings shall be designed according to this section. 
a.  Sight distance is measured from an assumed driver's eye height of 3.5 feet to a target height of 3.5 feet. The assumed driver position on the minor street approach is 14.5 feet from the edge of the major street travelled way. 
b.  A visual obstruction is assumed if an object or feature is between the heights of 2.5 and 6 feet, other than vehicles legally parked in designated parking spaces. Shade trees with branches a minimum of 6 feet above grade may be located within intersection sight distances. 
c.  Sight distances at uncontrolled intersections shall be a minimum of 30 feet along each leg without visual obstructions. 
d.  The legs of the intersection triangle shall be measured along each curb of the intersecting streets and from the point where said curb lines or extension thereto intersect. 
e.  The intersection sight distance shall meet the requirements shown in the following table: 
Sight Distance Table 1 Design Speed of Through Road (MPH) 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 Site Distance (In Feet) Left Turn from minor street stop 225 280 335 390 445 500 555 610 Right Turn from minor street stop 195 240 290 335 385 430 480 530 Left Turn from major street 165 205 245 285 325 365 405 445  
Table Notes: The values in the table assume a major street road width of two lanes and are based on passenger car operations for grades less than 3 percent. Refer to AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets for adjustments to account for conditions which differ from these assumptions. If a median is present on the major street and it is wide enough to store the design vehicle, then the left turn maneuver from the minor street can be treated as a two stage crossing. 
3.  The radius of the intersection curb return should be no greater than that needed to accommodate the design turning radius. The effective turning radius can include the width of the parking area where on-street parking is allowed. 
4.  In commercial areas with no on-street parking, the radius of the curb return should not be less than 25 feet. 
5.  Larger vehicles (semi-trailer combinations) may require additional space depending upon widths of streets and angle of turn. Encroachment into oncoming lanes during the turn should be avoided. 
6.  The placement of sidewalk ramps at intersections should create two distinct crossings at right angles rather than one single ramp in the middle of the curb radius. 
7.  The size of the corner radii shall consider the effects on turning speeds by vehicles smaller than the design vehicle, crossing distance for pedestrians, effect on sight lines, and right of way availability. 
8.  Intersections shall be designed based on anticipated traffic volumes of each transportation mode using the intersection. Preference should be given to designs that minimize the number of vehicular conflict points. 
9.  The number and types of lanes for collector and arterial street intersections shall be based on an analysis using the procedures of the Highway Capacity Manual or other method approved by the Village. 
10.  As a general rule, intersection operations should achieve an operating Level of Service of D or better for each movement at the intersection during the analysis hour. These periods are typically the morning and afternoon weekday peak hours; other hours may be identified by the Village for use in the analysis of intersection operations. 
11.  Intersection design shall be conducted to give consideration to accommodations of all users; motor vehicles of various sizes, transit vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. 
12.  Selection of an appropriate design vehicle is required. At a minimum, all intersections shall accommodate a Village Fire Department vehicle. Requirements of the State and Cook County, and other agencies may dictate use of a different design vehicle. 
13.  Accommodations for pedestrian and bicyclist crossings should be provided as well as consideration for transit service. 
14.  The intersection design and layout should strive to accommodate all movements. Design alternatives that restrict movements are generally discouraged. Exceptions include situations where there access control, safety, and/or traffic operations dictate otherwise. 
15.  Roundabout intersection designs are viable alternatives in most cases and should be evaluated in the set of potential options. The Federal Highway Administration's publication on the Design of Modern Roundabouts should be consulted during the evaluation and design of intersection type. 
16.  Traffic Controls. 
a.  Traffic controls shall meet all provisions of the Development and Standards Manual and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
b.  Intersections typically should be designed and operated with the minimum level of traffic control needed to safely and efficiently serve users. 
c.  The selection of the level of traffic control for intersections shall be based on volume of traffic, speed, sight distance, functional classification, pedestrian and bicycle activity, and other factors as determined by the Village. Redesign or modifications of existing intersections may also consider reported crash history in the evaluation of intersection control options. The Village uses the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices to evaluate the need for traffic controls. 
17.  Pedestrian, Bicycle, and other user Accommodations. 
a.  Intersections - Marked Crosswalks. 
1)  School crosswalks shall be established adjacent to the school property as well as at locations on the walking route to school as determined by the Village. School crosswalks are typically marked with a Continental striping configuration. 
2)  Other crosswalks will be marked as directed by the Village based on the physical and operating characteristics of the area. Crosswalks other than school areas are typically marked with a Standard striping configuration. 
b.  Midblock crossings may be used in situations where long blocks exist or at locations where the surrounding land use and pedestrian connectivity indicate a need. When used, midblock crossings will be marked with Continental striping configuration and warning signs. 
c.  Intersection Treatments. 
1)  Pedestrian and bicycle movements should be accommodated to the degree practical on each leg of an intersection. Local streets typically do not require traffic control signs or markings for crossings. Crossings on collector and arterial streets shall be considered on a case by case basis to determine the required level of traffic control using factors such as speed, volume, visibility, terrain, proximity of pedestrian and bicycle generators and attractions, among other factors. 
2)  Crosswalk pavement markings shall consist of a standard marking of two parallel six inch white lines delineating the crosswalk. School crosswalk markings referred to as the Continental configuration consist of white longitudinal markings, [1 to 2] feet wide with a 2 to 3 foot gap. The size and spacing of the Continental marking can be adjusted so that wheel paths fall within the gaps between the white striped markings. 
3)  Advance and crossing warning signs may be used where approach sight distance is limited or as determined by the Village. 
4)  Warning beacons, either standard flashing beacons or rectangular rapid flash beacons may be used where emphasis is needed for the crossing. 
5)  Curb extensions/bump-outs should be considered along primary routes to school and locations where significant pedestrian activity is expected to occur. The width of the curb extension should not exceed that of the parking lane width. Turn radii shall be based on the design vehicle turning requirements. Crosswalk signs and Continental striping configuration shall be used with curb extensions. 
6)  A required median island refuge shall provide a minimum of six (6) feet of refuge area. 
7)  Channelizing island refuges shall be used at intersections where excess undefined pavement space exists for turns. 
8)  Accessible ramps, truncated domes, pedestrian signal heads with countdown timer pushbuttons at traffic signals shall be incorporated into the design. 
G.  Driveways. 
1.  A paved driveway shall be provided between the sidewalk or right-of-way and the garage or building unit served. The driveway shall match the apron width at the sidewalk. 
2.  Driveways shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 9 and Chapter 11 of the Municipal Code and shall conform to the Standard specifications. 
3.  The principles of intersection design apply directly to driveways. In particular, driveways should have well-defined locations and afford adequate lines of sight. Large graded or paved areas adjacent to the traveled way that allow drivers to enter or leave the street randomly are not allowed. 
4.  Sight distance is an important design control for driveways. Driveway locations where sight distance is not sufficient will not be permitted. Horizontal and vertical obstructions to the driver's line of sight will be evaluated as part of the intersection design. 
5.  Non-residential and multifamily driveways shall be located as far as practical from adjacent intersections and shall consider the location of adjacent access points on the same and opposite sides of the street. For major entrances, a traffic study should be conducted to evaluate the location and spacing of drives serving commercial properties. 
6.  Cross connections of adjacent properties are encouraged and may be required as part of site plan approval to better manage and control the number and locations of driveways on the public street. 
7.  The width of the driveway for a non-residential or multifamily properties shall be based on the findings of a traffic analysis for the property. A median to separate entering and exiting traffic should be considered when there is more than one lane entering or exiting the property.

A.  All streets in the Village of Hoffman Estates shall be provided with a complete lighting system, in accordance with plans prepared by a registered professional engineer of the State of Illinois, and submitted to the Village Engineer for approval. The lighting system shall be of such design as to promote a safe traffic way for pedestrians and vehicular movement. 
B.  The design and installation of lighting system shall conform in all aspects to Village of Hoffman Estates Development Requirements and Standards Manual. 
C.  The street lighting system shall consist of light poles placed at intervals of 250 feet on all new arterial and collector streets, and at all other areas requiring lighting for safety. Minor streets shall have at a minimum, light poles located at each intersection, curves, long mid-blocks and as directed by the Village Engineer. Pedestrian and bicycle crossings located at midblock locations shall be illuminated. 
D.  The street lighting system shall essentially consist of poles, luminaries, cables and photo cell controllers. The system shall be group operated, centrally controlled, properly protected, and shall pass a megohm insulation resistance test prior to final connection and approval, and shall meet the requirements set forth in the Standard Specifications.

(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-3-11. - Storm drainage. 
A.  Adequate provisions shall be made within the site or subdivision for proper drainage of stormwater. All street pavements shall be provided with drainage inlets discharging directly into a storm sewer system which shall conduct such stormwater to an established watercourse or outfall sewer. Inlets shall be placed in gutter lines of pavement at such intervals as may be necessary to ensure proper drainage, and shall be located away from sidewalk ramps. 
B.  All street pavements within the site or subdivision shall include a combination concrete curb and gutter. Underdrains shall be installed in back of the curb and gutter if conditions warrant its use, as determined by the Village Engineer. 
C.  All storm sewers and connection pipes between drainage structures and storm sewers which are constructed beneath existing or proposed paving improvements shall be backfilled with trench backfill material in accordance with the standards and specifications of the Engineering Division and Public Works Department. 
D.  The design of the drainage system within the development shall anticipate and provide capacity for other drainage from naturally tributary land. Such design shall provide adequate capacity for transmitting such drainage from the other tributary areas on the basis of the ultimate development of such other tributary areas, but such drainage system need not make provision for the retention of drainage from other tributary areas. 
E.  All lots within a subdivision shall be graded in a manner so that the rear portion shall not drain towards the street unless done so by means of stormwater pipes. In no case shall the overland discharge course exceed 200 feet without flowing into a stormwater pipe. Spacing of catch basins or inlets shall not exceed 300 feet or as required by the Village Engineer to ensure proper drainage. 
F.  There shall be no overland discharge from sump pumps. All sump pump discharges shall discharge into a drainage structure or pipe. Only sump pumps which would discharge into a receiving water body will be allowed outside of the storm sewer system. 
G.  Storm sewer manhole structures shall be located near the property lines. These structures shall not be located within driveway aprons or sidewalks. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-3-12. - Stormwater detention. 
A.  Metropolitan Water Reclamation District. All rules and regulations of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) and the Village of Hoffman Estates relative to stormwater shall be applicable and subject to the modifications enumerated hereinafter. 
B.  Storage Requirements. 
1.  The live detention storage to be provided will be calculated on the basis of the 100-year frequency rainfall as shown in Bulletin 70, State of Illinois, Department of Energy and Natural Resources for this area. The detention volume required will be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100-year rainfall for any and all durations, from the fully developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir, subtracting that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate. Stormwater storage in parking lots and drive aisles shall provide for a clear path for building occupants (employees, visitors, residents, etc.) to travel between parked vehicles and the building entrance without walking through standing water. Water may pond in drive aisles up to three inches in depth as part of a stormwater storage system only if it meets the foregoing criteria. 
2.  Detention is required for any residential parcel five acres or greater in size and for any non-residential parcel one-half acres or greater in area. 
C.  Storm Sewer Release/Detention Basin. All overland release of stormwater must be routed through the detention basin to aid in water quality. Best Management Practices (BMP) shall be used to improve water quality as much as possible before leaving the development site. Best Management Practices include but are not limited to bioswales, infiltration basins or trenches, wetland basins, rain gardens, or others as approved by the Director of Engineering. 
D.  Release Rate. The release rate of stormwater from all developments requiring detention shall follow both Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) and Village of Hoffman Estates requirements and shall not exceed the stormwater runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state and as may be further limited by the carrying capacity of the natural channels or storm sewer system. The Village will accept the release rate of not greater than that calculated from a storm of three year frequency with a runoff rate coefficient of 0.15, unless the applicant can show by his detailed calculations, which must be acceptable to the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District and the Director of Engineering, that the discharge rate of the natural outlet channel serving the area is greater. In order to eliminate small multiple discharge outlets, not more than one outlet from a site shall be provided unless authorized by the Director of Engineering. 
E.  Drainage System. Drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass through the development the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of design frequency assuming that the land is in a fully developed state under present zoning or as proposed under the Village Comprehensive Plan. The bypass flow rate shall be computed utilizing a runoff coefficient of not less than 0.35. An allowance will be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and release rate has previously been approved by the Village and that evidence of its construction can be shown. 
F.  Overland Flow. The overland flow path for all developments must be shown on final plan documents. The overland flow path should avoid private property, and streets should be used whenever possible. Water exceeding one foot deep in paved areas and two feet deep in unpaved areas shall be prohibited in the overland flow path. 
Overland flow in parking lots shall not occur in parking stalls. It shall be limited to drive aisles and other areas where parking does not occur. The area inundated by water shall be located away from residences and shall not exceed three hundred feet across in any direction. There shall be a freeboard (vertical separation of at least 18 inches[)] between the high water of the overland flow path at the 100-year storm event and the lowest grade adjacent to any building. 
G.  Stormwater Management Minimum Requirements. All developments which do not meet MWRD or Village minimum acreage for detention volume requirements for residential and non-residential development as specified in B.2. above, must utilize Best Management Practices (BMP's) to reduce the rate of runoff and improve water quality. This may include but not be limited to bioswales, rain gardens, or similar infiltration systems designed for stormwater control. 
H.  Maintenance. The owner of any parcel upon which a detention area, drainage swale, or ditch is located shall be responsible for the maintenance of any such detention area, swale, or ditch, including maintenance of landscaping, any necessary dredging, and the maintenance of such facilities in proper functioning condition unless a property owner's association undertakes such maintenance, or unless the Village elects to own such facilities, in which case such association or the Village, as the case may be, shall undertake such maintenance. All wet and dry basins must be maintained to prevent soil erosion and loss of bank. Any indication of unsightliness, weeds in excess of ten inches tall, loss of property, disruption of utilities, or other conditions which pose a safety risk, must be abated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. The Village shall have the right to enter upon the subject property and maintain all detention and retention areas, swales, or ditches not owned by it, upon any owner's or association's failure to do so (after reasonable notice and the continued failure of such owner or association to maintain such system), and to assess such owner or such association for the costs (including attorneys' fees and litigation expenses) reasonably incurred by the Village in undertaking such maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-3-13. - Erosion and sedimentation control. 
A.  General Principles. It is the objective of this Section to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities in the Village. Measures taken to control erosion and sedimentation shall be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site and shall be in accordance with the "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control" adopted by the North Cook County Soil and Water Conservation District (or Kane-DuPage Soil and Water Conservation District, where appropriate). The following principles shall apply to all development activities within the Village and to the preparation of the submissions required under Section 10-3-14[.] 
1.  Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
2.  Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed wherever possible. 
3.  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development. 
4.  Sediment basins, debris basins, desalting basins, silt traps or filters must be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters on land undergoing development. Soil erosion control measures must be in place prior to any construction. 
5.  The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and benefits involved. 
6.  In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered. 
7.  Provision should be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion. 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as practical during development. Refer to Article 4 of this Code for a listing of recommended planting seasons.

(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-3-15. - Grading. 
A.  Operation Standards and Requirements. 
1.  Applicability. All grading, stripping, excavating, and filling which is subject to the permit requirements of Section 10-3-14, Sub-Section A, and any grading, stripping, excavating and filling which is exempted from the permit requirement by Section 10-3-14, Sub-Section B, shall be subject to the applicable standards and requirements set forth in this Sub-Section A. 
2.  Responsibility. The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, and the Village or its officers or agents will not be made liable for such damage, by (a) the issuance of a permit under this Section, (b) compliance with the provisions of that permit or with conditions attached to it by the Director of Engineering, (c) failure of Village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions, (d) failure of Village officials to recommend denial of or to deny a permit, or (e) exemptions from the permit requirements of this Section. 
3.  Handbook Adopted by Reference. The standards and specifications contained in "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control" cited in Section 10-3-14, Sub-Section D-4, are hereby incorporated into this Sub-Section A and made a part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation under site development and erosion and sedimentation control plans approved under Section 10-3-14, Sub-Section D. In the event of conflict between provisions of said manual and of this Section, this Section shall govern. 
4.  Inspection. The Director of Engineering shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved. Plans approved by the Director of Engineering for grading, stripping, excavating, and filling work shall be maintained at the site during progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections, the permittee shall notify the Director of Engineering at least two working days before the completion of: 
a.  Stripping and clearing, 
b.  Rough grading, 
c.  Final grading, 
d.  Final landscaping. 
If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area. If an inspection is not made or notification of the inspection is not given within five working days after notice is received by the Village from the permittee, the permittee may continue work at his own risk, without presuming acceptance by the Village. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in writing at the site. 
5.  Special Precautions. 
a.  If at any stage of the grading of any development site the Director of Engineering determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, the Director of Engineering may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions be taken as is considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and/or recommendations of a registered soils engineer or engineering geologist which may make further work necessary. 
b.  Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the Director of Engineering may specify the start of grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains. 
c.  All disturbed or exposed soil on a site approved for development must have an established stand of grass present within three months of disturbance or grading if construction is not actively occurring on that site or on that section of the site. This is done to control erosion. 
6.  Amendment of Plans. Major amendments of the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the Director of Engineering and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the Director of Engineering by written authorization to the permittee. 
7.  Expiration of Permit. Every site development permit shall expire and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within 180 days, or is not completed by a date which shall be specified in the permit; except that the Director of Engineering may, if the permittee presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of the permit. 
B.  Enforcement. 
1.  Stop-Work Order. In the event any person conducting site development pursuant to this Section violates the terms of the site work, or carries on-site development in such a manner as to materially cause an adverse affect upon the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the development site, or so as to be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the Director of Engineering may suspend the site development work. 
a.  Suspension of site work shall be made by a written stop-work order issued by the Director of Engineering and delivered to the developer or his agent or the person performing the work. The stop-work order shall be effective immediately, shall state the specific violations cited and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. 
2.  Appeal. The developer shall have a right to appeal a stop order issued by the Director of Engineering to the President and Village Board within five days of the issuance of such order by filing written notice to the Village Manager on forms provided by the Village. Upon receiving notice of Appeal, the Village Manager shall meet with the developer in advance of the Village Board meeting with the purpose of arriving at an agreed statement of facts and issues which shall be submitted to the Village Board in advance of the hearing on Appeal. The hearing shall be conducted by the President and Village Board in accordance with its rules and procedures which accord the developer "due process" of law. 
3.  In addition to any other penalty authorized by Article 5, any person, partnership, or corporation convicted of violating any of the provisions of this Section shall be required to restore the site to the condition existing prior to commission of the violation, or to bear the expense of such restoration. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-3-16. - Soils investigations and physical tests. 
A.  All materials testing for any project shall be required from the developer/owner. This would include but not be limited to asphalt testing, compaction tests, concrete cylinders, or soil tests. 
B.  If the subdivision contains questionable soils and, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, soils investigations, borings or other soils tests are necessary to determine the nature and extent of such questionable material, the owner or developer shall retain or cause to be retained the services of a testing laboratory acceptable to the Village to perform the needed investigations. 
C.  Copies of the completed reports prepared by the testing laboratory shall be filed with the Village Engineer. 
D.  The Village shall have no liability for costs connected with the tests, borings or interpretation of results of such work. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
ARTICLE 4. - LANDSCAPING 

Sec. 10-4-1. - Purpose. 
    The landscape requirements are intended to: promote the welfare of the community; insure aesthetic compatibility among land uses; further establish street corridor plantings; encourage the retention of existing mature trees and the planting of indigenous vegetation; help prevent soil erosion; minimize nuisances and harmful effects; screen unsightly elements; and protect property values. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-4-2. - General landscape improvement standards. 
A.  Landscape improvements shall serve to integrate the project to the site, with particular sensitivity to the natural topography, watercourses, and existing native vegetation. Preservation of the existing landscape material and landforms shall be taken into account, particularly where mature trees are a part of the site. This is of particular importance in cases where specimen trees, groves or treelines, or tree-lined watercourses are present. 
B.  Landscape improvements shall serve to enhance the appearance of the site, especially as viewed from an adjacent public right-of-way. Effective year-round screening shall be provided to lessen the visual prominence of: parking lots; service yards; loading docks; public utility structures; or unsightly appurtenances. Innovative landscape design proposals are encouraged. 
C.  Unless dictated elsewhere in the Municipal Code, a minimum of 20 percent of the total gross lot area of all multi-family residential development shall be comprised of a landscaped pervious surface area. Detention or retention areas located on a lot or parcel shall not be included in this total. 
D.  Landscape improvements shall enhance the architecture of existing and proposed structures by being of similar scale where possible. 
E.  Landscape plantings shall be protected from vehicular and pedestrian encroachment. 
F.  Control of erosion on berms and embankments shall be required. Detention/retention areas, berms, and sloped areas shall be designed to resemble natural land forms, whenever possible. A minimum ten-foot landscape buffer shall surround all detention/retention areas and shall not exceed 5:1 (horizontal:vertical) slope. This buffer area may overlap other required buffer areas (e.g. parking lot buffers). 
G.  The aesthetic and functional aspects of landscape improvements shall be considered both at installation and maturity. Groupings of trees or other plantings are recommended for optimal visual effect and ease of maintenance. Landscape species that are native to the region and thrive with minimal watering are encouraged. 
H.  In certain areas where the installation of required trees may be difficult due to site constraints or existing physical barriers, a cash in lieu option for trees may be considered by the Village Board where findings are made that the site constraints make it impractical to install the trees. The cost equivalent per tree shall be determined by the Village. 
I.  A permanent means of providing water for the irrigation of plant materials shall be provided on all developments. The installation of an underground irrigation system is recommended where feasible. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-4-3. - Applicability of landscape requirements. 
A.  For new development, landscape improvements shall be provided, at a minimum, in the following areas: 
1.  One- and Two-Family Residential: all areas, including right-of-way areas; model areas; public/private open space areas; and easement areas that contain above ground utility structures. 
2.  All other development: all areas, including right-of-way areas. 
B.  For development involving property improvements (e.g., a building or parking lot addition), landscape requirements as specified in this Article shall apply. The level of required landscape improvements will be based upon the scale of the site plan amendment being proposed. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-4-4. - Landscape improvement areas. 
A.  Right-of-Way. 
1.  Performance Standards.

Within intersection sight distance limits, street trees with branches located a minimum of six feet above grade shall be planted on terrain that is level or nearly level to adjacent road surfaces. 
c.  Minimum clearances shall be provided as follows: 
1)  Eight feet between the center trunkline of a street tree and a fire hydrant. 
2)  Four feet between the center trunkline of a street tree and any paved surface (e.g., sidewalk, driveway or curb). 
d.  The lateral distance between street trees and overhead utility lines and the lateral distance between street trees and underground utility mains shall be maximized wherever possible. 
e.  In developments requiring more than 20 street trees, the following standards apply: 
1)  No genus selected for planting shall exceed 20 percent of the overall total of trees being planted. 
2)  No species selected for planting shall exceed ten percent of the overall total of street trees being planted. 
3)  Street trees shall be planted in a sequence using all approved species in an alternating fashion, or with no more than six of the same species being planted in succession.

(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-4-6. - Establishment and maintenance of landscape improvements. 
    The owner, tenant, and their agent shall be jointly and severally responsible for the initial establishment and ongoing maintenance of all landscape improvements, as indicated on approved development plans. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-4-7. - Tree preservation. 
A.  Performance Standards. All reasonable efforts shall occur in the architectural layout and site design of a proposed development to preserve existing trees, most especially mature trees, specimen trees, tree groves or tree lines. These preservation requirements are applicable to naturally occurring trees on undeveloped parcels of property. The removal of trees that were planted under a Village site plan approval shall be subject to review under the site plan amendment process rather than the preservation standards within this code section. 
B.  Minimum Requirements. 
1.  Within all right-of-way areas (both residential and non-residential right-of-way areas), the removal or clearing of any tree(s) shall not be permitted prior to receiving either: 
a.  Approval by the Village Board; 
b.  A tree removal permit from the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services. 
2.  On land located in the Village other than developed detached single-or two-family residential lots of less than one acre in size, and all right-of-way areas, the removal or clearing of any trees having a minimum diameter of three inches or greater shall not be permitted, prior to receiving either: 
a.  Approval by the Village Board; 
b.  A tree removal permit from the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services. Penalties for unauthorized removals shall be as set forth under "Tree Preservation". 
3.  A Tree Preservation Plan, in accordance with the Tree Preservation Standards approved by the Village Board and/or a site development permit issued by the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services shall be required for development projects that include tree preservation. 
4.  All grading and construction equipment shall be forbidden from encroaching within the root zone of a tree to be preserved. No excess soil, additional fill, liquids or construction debris, shall be placed within the root zone of any tree that is required to be preserved. 
5.  Crushed limestone hydrocarbons and other materials detrimental to trees shall not be dumped within the root zone of any tree nor at any higher location where drainage toward the tree could conceivably affect the health of the tree. 
6.  No attachments, fences or wires, other than approved materials for bracing, guying or wrapping shall be attached to any vegetation during the construction period. 
7.  No measures such as construction pruning and root pruning of trees directly impacted by construction shall occur unless specifically indicated part of the approved Tree Preservation Plan. 
8.  During construction, all reasonable steps necessary to prevent the destruction or damaging of trees (other than those specified to be removed) shall be taken. The developer shall be responsible for the prevention of dropping, tracking and/or accumulation of dirt, mud or other loose materials on sidewalks, driveways or street. Trees destroyed or receiving major damage shall be replaced per subsection C. 
9.  Unless otherwise authorized and specifically noted on either a Tree Removal Permit or on a Landscape or Tree Preservation Plan approved by the Village Board, no soil is to be removed from within the root zone of any tree that is to remain. 
C.  Tree Preservation Standards. The tree preservation standards are intended to guide development of wooded parcels where the buildings are placed among the trees. Plans in which separate areas of trees are proposed to be set aside for preservation will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
1.  Inventory. The inventory of trees on a site is a fundamental step in assessing the opportunities for development and tree preservation. A two-stage tree survey process is required. The two-stage approach permits proper assessment and planning of development sites, while controlling tree surveying costs. Locations for smaller trees (six-inch to less than 12 inches DBH) are required in Stage Two, once an overall concept plan has been developed. 
a.  Stage One. The first stage information is to be used in the overall planning of the site. This includes general road, utilities and lot or building layout. 
In the first stage, all trees equal to or greater than 12 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH), measured four and one-half feet above ground line, shall be located on a tree survey (with accuracy as required by the Village) at scales consistent with the engineering plan, site plan and subdivision plat. The specie, size (DBH) and condition (per Village requirements) shall be noted on the survey or in an accompanying document keyed to location. These trees shall be numbered in the field and on the plans. 
Trees that are less than 12 inches DBH shall be included in a type map of the site that is prepared at scales consistent with the engineering plan, site plan, and subdivision plat. The type map shall delineate the vegetative communities on the site and will include trees less than 12 inches DBH of all species and other significant vegetation. The type map shall include canopy trees, understory trees and shrubs, and ground plan plants. Data shall include species, density, size, class and other pertinent information (e.g. approximately 25 white and red oaks under six inches DBH, and 15 red oaks over six feet 12 inches DBH in good condition, area appears poorly drained). The number of trees six inches to less than 12 inches must be designated along with their specie and condition (see Stage Two). 
No survey shall be required of any trees in a delineated wetland, nor shall any credits be allowed for such trees. 
b.  Stage Two. In this stage, the specific placement of buildings, roads, utilities, driveways, etc. are determined. 
A survey of trees between six inches and less than 12 inches DBH (remaining outside of the designated street pavement areas, detention ponds, and delineated wetlands) shall be conducted (with an accuracy as required by the Village). The specie, size (DBH) and condition (per Village requirements) shall be noted on the survey or in a table. 
c.  Condition Rating. The condition of the trees shall be based on a 6-point scale with 1 being the best and 6 the worst. 
Rating Description General Criteria 1 Excellent The tree is typical of the species, has less than 10 percent deadwood in the crown that is attributable to normal causes, has no other observed problems, and requires no remedial action. 2 Good to Fair The tree is typical of the species and/or has less than 20 percent deadwood in the crown, only one or two minor problems that are easily corrected with normal care. 3 Fair The tree is typical of the species and/or has less than 30 percent deadwood in the crown, one or two minor problems that are not eminently lethal to the tree, and no significant decay or structural problems, but the tree must have remedial care above normal care in order to minimize the impact of future stress and to insure continued health. 4 Fair to Poor The tree is not typical of the species and/or has significant problems such as 30-50 percent deadwood in the crown, serious decay or structural defect, insects, disease, or other problems that can be eminently lethal to the tree or create a hazardous tree if not corrected in a short period of time or if the tree is subjected to additional stress. 5 Poor The tree is not typical of the species and/or has over 50 percent deadwood in the crown, major decay or structural problems, is hazardous or is severely involved with insects, disease or other problems that even if aggressively corrected would not result in the long-term survival of the tree. 6 Dead Less than 10 percent of the tree shows signs of life.  
The assignment of the category ratings to specific trees are subject to the approval of the Village Department of Development Services which shall make the final determination. The Village Department of Development Services may, at its discretion, retain an urban forestry consultant to assist the Village (utilizing funds placed on deposit for this purpose by the petitioner). 
2.  Preservation Standards -The preservation standards set forth the number of trees that are required to be retained on a development site. The standards take the condition, size and specie into account in determining how many trees need to be retained. The standards also provide for the option of mitigating the removal of additional trees by planting compensating trees according to the schedule outlined below. 
a.  Number of trees by species, size and condition. The first stage tree inventory required above shall be utilized as the basis for determining the number of trees to be preserved on a site. The number of trees retained on the site shall be based on the tables below, however, in no case shall the total number of existing trees retained on site, with or without mitigation, be less than 15 percent of all living trees six inches and larger: 
1)  For trees in fair or better condition (in the opinion of the Village): 
Table 1 
Required Tree Retention 
(without Mitigation) (1) 
Tree Size (3) 6-11.5? DBH 12-29.5" DBH > = 30? DBH Species Quality Species Group A (2) 45% 55% 65% Species Group B (2) 30% 40% 50% Species Group C (2) 0% 10% 15%  
Note 1: Mitigation may, at the option of the developer, reduce the percentage of existing trees retained by providing additional trees - see subsection (d), Mitigation. 
Note 2: The Species Groups are defined as: 
(a)  Species Group A shall include trees rated 70 or above on the IAA rating system*. This group includes trees such as Bur Oak, Shagbark Hickory. 
(b)  Species Group B shall include trees rated at 50 or 60 on the IAA rating system*. This group includes trees such as Norway Maple, White Ash. 
(c)  Species Group C shall include trees rated below 50 on the IAA rating system*. This group includes trees such as Boxelder, Slippery Elm. 
*IAA rating system refers to the publication "Species Rating and Appraisal Factors for Illinois" by the Illinois Arborist Association (most recent edition). 
Note 3: For trees in fair or better condition (in the opinion of the Village). 
b.  Qualification for consideration as preserved. In order to be considered preserved a tree must meet all of the following criteria: 
Table 2:
Preservation Criteria 
Undisturbed Critical Root Zone Area AND Undisturbed CRZ Circumference Species Group A 85% 75% Species Group B 75% 60% Species Group C 75% 60%  
The critical root zone (CRZ) is defined as a circle around a tree with one foot of radius for every one inch of tree diameter at breast height (DBH). 
The undisturbed critical root zone area is equal to the percentage of the area of the critical root zone in which there is no alteration of the natural grade (including, but not limited to, filling, excavation, trenching). 
The undisturbed circumference is equal to the distance along the critical root zone circumference between the disturbed critical root zone areas (including, but not limited to filling, excavation and trenching) which intersect the circumference. The distance shall exclude all of the disturbed area at the circumference. 
In addition to the undisturbed critical root zone area and circumference, in order to qualify as a preserved tree, the critical root zone must be free of any influences outside it that may effect the health of the tree (including, but not limited to, site drainage alteration). The developer must comply with any maintenance and preparation requirements (including, but not limited to, watering, mulching, root pruning, limb pruning, fertilizing, fencing, etc.) as determined by the Village at the time of any approvals. This may include additional requirements at the time of subdivision and site plan approval, if applicable. The Village shall have the right to request notification of upcoming maintenance, as well as records detailing performed maintenance, to confirm that maintenance is being performed properly. 
c.  Trees that meet the criteria of this section shall be considered preserved, and no replacement trees shall be required if the tree dies (except as provided under Enforcement). 
1)  Criteria for Retention. The Village may consider a variety of criteria in determining the individual trees that are to be retained for preservation. Preserved trees must meet the standards listed above. In addition, the Village may consider the condition of individual trees, tree groupings, appearance, the overall diversity of tree species and sizes on the parcel, and the long-term viability of the trees on the site in determining the specific trees to be retained. Final plans for tree retention shall be included in the subdivision or site plan approvals as appropriate. 
2)  Tree Preservation Plan. Tree retention and mitigation shall be considered as part of the development review process outlined in the Subdivision Code. A tree preservation plan shall be submitted at a scale consistent with the engineering plans. The plan shall also include a list of all trees indicating their fate (removed or preserved), as well as their tag number, location, specie, size, condition, whether the tree is a preserved tree or a mitigation tree, and any treatment that may be applied to the tree (e.g. pruning, fertilizing, etc.). The plan shall also include the location of all tree preservation fencing and silt fencing. Mitigation calculations in accordance with the procedures set forth herein shall be included. 
3)  Tree Protection. Tree protection fencing shall be noted on engineering and site plans. Fencing shall be located at the limit of construction. (NOTE: It may not always be outside of the CRZ). 
The installation of fencing shall be in accordance with Village requirements. The fence shall consist at a minimum of wood snow fence (and erosion control fence where siltation may occur) secured to metal posts at a maximum of eight-foot intervals. Erosion control fence, in conjunction with tree protection fencing, must not be trenched into the ground. An alternative Village approved method must be utilized. At a minimum, signs which are legible at ten feet shall be posted and maintained at intervals no less than 30 feet which clearly state "Tree Protection Area. Do not enter. Do not move or alter fence. Violation subject to fine and work stoppage". The Village may, at its option, install the fencing utilizing funds deposited with the Village by the developer for that purpose. All tree protection fencing must be installed and maintained prior to any construction as approved by the Village as part of the approval process. In no case shall tree protection fencing be removed, breached, temporarily removed, altered, or relocated without written authorization from the Department of Development Services of the Village. 
The removal, temporary removal, alteration, or relocation of an installed tree protection fence without written authorization from the Department of Development Services of the Village shall incur a penalty of $100.00 per occurrence. The developer/builder shall be responsible for paying this penalty. 
Entering a tree protection area that was required to be fenced shall result in an additional penalty of $50.00 per diameter inch for any tree that is damaged in the opinion of the Village, including, but not limited to, grading, trenching, limb or bark removal, storage of materials or parking of vehicles. The cost of any necessary remedial tree care action, in the opinion of the Village, shall be the responsibility of the developer/builder. 
4)  Financial Guarantee. A financial guarantee for the purpose of assuring compliance with tree protection standards shall be required by the Village. The financial guarantee amount shall be $100.00 per tree to be retained, but in no case less than $10,000.00. This amount may be included as part of the overall project guarantee. 
d.  Mitigation. It is recognized that some tree loss is necessary to develop many parcels. The mitigation process is intended to replace the lost trees with added tree density. The percentage of trees retained on the site may be reduced in accordance with Table 3 with the approval of the Village Board if compensatory trees were provided in accordance with Table 4. Mitigation is only required for the trees removed below the standards in Table 1 Required Tree Retention .

Caliper is measured at 6? above the root collar for trees up to and including four-inch (4?) caliper. Caliper for trees larger than four-inch (4?) stock is measured at twelve inches (12?) above the root collar. 
Translating of existing trees shall be permitted as mitigation trees. All mitigation trees (nursery stock and transplanted) shall be guaranteed for three years after acceptance of the subdivision (or final certificate of occupancy) whichever occurs last. 
Trees that are otherwise eligible to be retained, but which do not meet the preservation criteria (Table 2), may be considered as mitigation trees. However, they must be guaranteed for three years after acceptance. If such trees fail to meet acceptance criteria, they must be replaced in accordance with the provisions of this section, except for Table 4; such trees need only be replaced on the basis of 1 caliper inch for each 1? of diameter (DBH). 
No credit for mitigation trees shall be given for trees required under the Village Subdivision Code (for example perimeter or street trees). Mitigation trees shall be placed on the site from which they are removed if possible (in the opinion of the Village). If the number of trees cannot be accommodated in the site, they may be on other sites in the Village in accordance with the approval by the Village Board.

As such, major site developers are encouraged to provide information regarding trip reduction proposals to be implemented as part of a site traffic management plan. 
New projects developed near existing or potential transit systems should coordinate with local mass transit providers to locate transit stops near the project site when practical. Overall site design should provide attractive functional and direct sidewalks, paths, and walkways to existing mass transit stops. If an existing mass transit stop is on or adjacent to the project, then the site should provide a safe, well lit, and weather-proof transit shelter for transit users along with a pedestrian connection to the site. Developer should locate signage, brochures, and maps near building exits that indicate the location of nearby transit stops and routes in coordination with the Village and the transit provider. 
For non-residential and non-retail projects, lockable changing areas and showers are encouraged to be provided for employees who choose to walk or bike to work. Lockable restrooms or bathroom stalls may be used for changing areas as long as they are sized to allow convenient changing. 
D.  Speed Control Devices. The use of speed bumps, speed humps, or other similar speed control devices shall be prohibited. 
E.  Traffic Control Measures. Traffic control measures shall be posted as required by the Police Department and a letter to enforce such restrictions submitted to the Police Department (when the Police Department has agreed to enforce such restrictions) prior to issuance of any occupancy certificate. A private property enforcement agreement with the Village Police Department is required to be recorded for on-site traffic regulations to be enforceable. All traffic control devices shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the Village's Development and Standards Manual. It is the responsibility of the Developer and property owner to ensure compliance with the applicable requirements. 
F.  Intersection Sight Visibility. No structure, landscape material, or parked vehicle(s) shall be located within an intersection sight distance triangle, as defined in Section 10-3-2, in such a manner as to limit or obstruct the sight distances of motorists entering or leaving an intersection. This shall include intersections within parking areas formed by parking rows and aisles. This provision also applies to snow storage on the site. 
G.  Lighting. Exterior lighting on private development sites shall provide light levels that are appropriate for the safety and convenience of employees, visitors, and others on the property. All exterior lighting shall be installed and operated in accordance with the following requirements. For lighting of public and private streets, reference Section 10-3-4. 
1.  Site lighting shall meet Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) of North America recommendations, with specific requirements for parking lots identified in the following tables. In the event IES adopts an updated version of these standards, the development may either meet the standards below or the updated standards.

2.  Minimum vertical Illuminance shall be measured at 5.0 feet above parking surface at the point of lowest horizontal Illuminance, excluding facing outward along boundaries. 
3.  High vehicular traffic and pedestrian locations should generally require the Enhanced Security Level of illumination as shown in the table above. Intersections, building exits and entrances, internal circulator roadways, etc. are examples where this is appropriate. 
4.  The design, placement, height, and shielding of lighting fixtures shall be compatible with the building, site improvements, and surrounding areas, and shall conform with the following. 
a)  Light pole standards shall generally not exceed 30 feet in height for sites less than 10 acres, and shall not exceed 40 feet in height for sites larger than 10 acres. The Village Board may approve higher fixtures as part of the site plan process where it is determined, in the opinion of the Village, that higher poles are justified. 
b)  Light pole bases shall be located in a manner that does not reduce the usable dimensions of a parking space, drive aisle, pedestrian path, or other required area of a site. 
c)  Light pole standards and bases shall be materials that are consistent with the quality of the building and other site improvements. Colors shall be complementary to the rest of the site improvements and shall be neutral in nature so as not to be used as attention attracting devices. Signage may not be displayed on poles or bases, except for light pole banners specifically permitted by Village Code. 
5.  The design of lighting standards and fixtures shall be of a type appropriate to the development. Lighting fixtures among all sites in a development shall be coordinated to provide design consistency. 
6.  Lighting shall not cause excessive glare or lighting levels onto adjacent roadways and properties. The following standards shall apply to all site development, with the exception of approved outdoor sports facilities, which shall be determined by the Village Board as part of the site plan approval process. 
a)  The illuminated face of all fixtures shall be parallel to the ground. Tilted fixtures shall not be permitted. 
b)  The light fixture shall be designed so the lens or light source does not extend below the fixture housing. 
c)  Outdoor lighting used to illuminate flags, structures, or landscape features must use full cut-off or directionally shielded lighting fixtures that are controlled so that the directed light is substantially confined to the object intended to be illuminated. The light source shall not be visible from adjacent properties or roadways. Additional landscaping or other site amenities may be used to fully shield the light source. 
d)  Excessive light levels which raise the brightness of a site to a level inconsistent with surrounding developed properties of similar land uses shall be discouraged. Determination of potential excessive of lighting levels shall consider the relationships between the proposed wattage, height, type of fixture, use of the property, and existing lighting levels on surrounding properties. 
e)  Lighting shall not be a nuisance to adjacent residents. For developments adjacent to residential properties, the emission of lighting, as measured in vertical and horizontal footcandles, shall not cause any increase in the existing light levels as measured beyond ten feet within the adjacent residential property. 
7.  All exterior fixtures shall be provided with automatic switches to operate the lights. All fixtures, except for security lighting, shall be turned off daily within one hour after site operations cease. 
8.  Light Pollution Reduction. All sites shall maintain safe light levels while avoiding off-site lighting trespass and night sky light pollution. Site lighting should be minimized where feasible and photometrics shall be employed in designing lighting plans. Designs that should be employed to reduce light pollution include full cut-off luminaries, low-reflectance surfaces and low-angle spotlights. 
9.  All exterior lighting should use the most energy-efficient technologies available unless it is not practical. 
H.  Building Design. The evaluation of building appearance shall be based on the quality of the design and the relationship to surrounding land uses. The building design standards will integrate several design elements and objectives and are intended to provide a framework for future developments and guide developers and consultants in their building design. These guidelines are not to be construed as limiting architectural creativity, but to promote development that will be successful. 
The goals of these guidelines are to ensure that the standards set forth will improve the character and aesthetics of the buildings and make them more attractive, collectively being built at a higher standard. 
1.  Building Scale and Massing: 
a.  Buildings shall be in scale with the ultimate development planned for the area, and be compatible with permanent neighboring developments. 
b.  Large retail buildings shall articulate their primary facades with various design elements to help reduce the overall scale of the building. 
c.  Large areas of massing should be avoided, or reserved for the rear or side of the building whenever possible. If it cannot be avoided, design elements shall be implemented to break up the massing. 
d.  The building mass near the front of the building or any area accessible or visible to the public shall be articulated to give it a more pedestrian scale. 
e.  Landscaping, as per Section 10-4-4-D, shall be incorporated along the foundations of the building facades to break up the monotony of a building mass. 
2.  Building Height and Roof Design: 
a.  Buildings with direct frontage to a public street(s) shall face the tallest façade of the building to the primary street. 
b.  Flat roof designs shall include an articulated parapet wall which acts as a structural element as well as a screening element. 
c.  Small variations that identify the top, middle and base of the building are encouraged. 
d.  Subtle breaks in the roofline are encouraged to break up longer runs of the façade/roof area. 
e.  Buildings with sloped roofs are encouraged to implement dormers and gables along the main frontage to help promote a prominent façade. 
3.  Building Materials and Color: 
a.  Materials shall have good architectural character and be in harmony with nearby buildings. 
b.  Materials shall be durable and suitable for the type of building and design in which they are used. 
c.  Any exterior building façade shall incorporate a predominance of high quality materials including brick, stone, glass, or an equivalent material, as approved by the Village Board. 
d.  Elevations visible to the public shall use brick, sandstone, or other native stone, textured concrete masonry, or an equivalent material, as approved by the Village Board. The use of more than one material is encouraged. 
e.  Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS) shall be accepted as an accent material on commercial buildings only. EIFS will not be allowed on multi-family residential buildings. Additionally, the use of concrete block, split face block or pre-cast panels on retail buildings is strongly discouraged. 
f.  Colors shall be harmonious and use compatible accents. A building shall utilize principal colors which are similar to those found on other buildings in the area or natural earth tones if there are no buildings are in the area. Accent colors (expressed as stripes, color bands, or other similar features) shall be permitted on a limited portion of the building. The accent colors shall not dominate the visual image of the building. 
g.  Any incorporated solar energy systems shall be designed to blend into the architecture of the building or be screened from view from public right-of-way and adjacent properties. The color of the solar collector shall be complementary to the roofing materials. 
h.  When practical, site development is encouraged to include building materials or products that have been extracted, harvested or recovered, as well as manufactured, locally (within 500 miles) of the project site. 
i.  When practical, site development is encouraged to incorporate building attributes that will reduce energy or water consumption, such as green or white roofs, passive lighting design, thermal energy storage, or others. 
4.  Architectural Elements: 
a.  All facades of a building should be designed with consistent materials and degree of architectural interest, except for service areas facing internal portions of a site where they will not be visible to adjacent properties, roadways, or visitors to the site. Any façade intended to be viewed by the public, such as those where wall signs are proposed, shall be designed with a high degree of architectural interest consistent with any façade facing a public roadway. 
b.  Architectural details such as arches, cornices, pilasters, friezes, tile work or moldings are encouraged. 
c.  Enhanced exterior light fixtures such as wall sconces, ground-mounted accent lights or decorative pedestal lights are encouraged. Such lighting shall adhere to the standards outlined in Section 10-5-3-G. 
d.  Prominent three-dimensional features such as belfries, clock towers, chimneys, towers or domes are encouraged. 
e.  Changes in color, texture and material shall be incorporated into the façade. 
f.  Building components, such as windows, doors, porches, eaves, roof spans, etc., shall be appropriately proportioned to one another. 
g.  Monotony of design shall be avoided. Variation in detail, form, and setting shall be used to provide visual interest of and among buildings, including façade and roof element. Variation shall be balanced by coherence of design elements. 
h.  Where topographic features contribute to the beauty or utility of a development, they shall be preserved and integrated into the development design. Modification of topography will be permitted where it contributes to good appearance and design. 
i.  A list of visual considerations shall be submitted by the developer with each site plan. These considerations shall include an inventory of the existing and planned areas of high visual interest in the project area. A detailed description shall be presented reviewing how the owner will design or locate buildings, and retain or alter existing terrain and trees in such a way as to maintain, enhance or create views within and into the site, as well as develop areas of visual interest. Landscape treatment shall be provided to enhance architectural features, strengthen vistas and develop important axes. 
I.  Rooftop Screening. All rooftop heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, satellite dishes, and other mechanical equipment (except isolated, non-obtrusive stacks and vents) shall be screened by a parapet wall or other approved enclosure of a height sufficient to provide complete screening from all adjacent properties (all elevations). Roof or building mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed the maximum allowed height in any zoning district. For purposes of height measurement, solar systems other than building-integrated solar systems shall meet the same screening requirements as other mechanical devices. 
J.  Utilities and Ground (Grade) Level Screening. Installations of all satellite dishes, HVAC equipment, utility services and structures, and other mechanical equipment shall conform to the following requirements: 
1.  All utility services (e.g. gas, electric, phone) shall be located underground. 
2.  Satellite dishes, HVAC equipment, and utility structures shall be screened, where possible, by walls, fences or other such elements. 
3.  All utility meters shall be located either inside the building itself, or in a recessed area within the rear or interior side facade of the building and shall be screened by walls that match the building material. Utility meters shall not be located within the front or corner side facades. 
4.  All ground mounted solar energy systems and other renewable energy generators must be screened from view to the extent possible without reducing their efficiency, and shall meet the principal structure setback for the zoning district in which it is installed. 
K.  Chain Link Fences. The use of chain link fences shall be prohibited, except for around tennis courts and other similar recreational facilities as approved by the Village Board. 
L.  Retaining Walls. The use of wooden retaining walls, including railroad ties, is prohibited. Only masonry or concrete walls are allowed. All residential retaining walls shall not exceed four feet in height. 
M.  Refuse Disposal and Recyclable Material Storage Areas. Provisions shall be made for the temporary storage of refuse and recyclable materials produced on-site, subject to the following requirements. Utilization of recycled materials for construction is encouraged in site development when feasible. A recycling collection program shall be established by the property owner in accordance with Section 7-9-1-L (Commercial Recycling requirement) of the Municipal Code. 
1.  Such storage shall be placed within a building or in an exterior fenced enclosure. Such enclosures shall provide screening by a solid fence or wall of a height, as approved by the Village Board, adequate to shield all containers within the enclosure, and material within the fenced enclosure shall not extend above the height of the fence or wall. The area shall be secured by a solid gate or provide an overlapping opening which completely screens all views into the enclosure. The use of chain link fences with slats shall be prohibited. 
2.  All refuse disposal and recyclable material storage enclosures shall be located in areas designed to provide adequate accessibility for service vehicles. Locations shall generally be to the rear of buildings or in areas where minimal exposure to public streets will exist. Such enclosures shall not be located in required aisles or landscaped buffers. 
3.  Where residential uses are located adjacent to a development, refuse disposal and recyclable material storage enclosures shall be discouraged from being placed in adjacent areas, and refuse disposal and recyclable material storage enclosures for food establishments shall not be located adjacent to boundaries with residential districts. 
4.  Refuse disposal and recyclable materials, and other equipment such as grease containers, or outdoor storage of materials such as pallets, shall not be placed outside of exterior fenced enclosures. 
5.  The location of such storage meet all sight distance requirements of this code and shall preserve adequate visibility for pedestrians using the site. 
N.  Signs. Site plan approval shall not authorize the placement of any signs on the subject property, however for buildings on a property where a Master Sign Plan has been adopted in conformance with the Zoning Code (Chapter 9), building elevations approved through the site plan approval may include areas specifically designated for signage installation, subject to conformance with all Zoning requirements. 
O.  Noise. No person, use or activity shall cause or allow the emission of sound beyond the boundaries of their property that would adversely affect adjoining properties. 
P.  Construction Waste Management. To the greatest extent practical, site development should include provisions to recycle and/or salvage non-hazardous construction and demolition debris. 
Q.  Antenna Installations and Wireless Telecommunication Facilities. Antenna panels, dishes, and visible elevated mounting hardware as part of an antenna installation or Wireless Telecommunication Facility shall be installed with a color to match the structure to which it is mounted or a neutral color to not contrast with the sky. Antennas and mounting hardware shall be installed with a low profile and the use of projecting brackets or other projecting hardware shall be limited to reduce the visibility of the installation. The Village may require stealth or camouflaged Wireless Telecommunication Facilities where the antennas are disguised inside a pole or some other structure. 
All equipment related to an antenna installation shall be screened from view. Building or rooftop mounted equipment shall be screened with materials that match or complement the building architecture. Rooftop mounted equipment shall be centrally located from the edge of the building, to the greatest extent possible. Ground mounted equipment shall be enclosed within a solid enclosure or building, preferably constructed of masonry or materials similar to those found elsewhere on the same or adjacent properties. Complementary landscaping may be required by the Village. 
(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13; Ord. No. 4364-2013, § 3, 4-15-13; Ord. No. 4521-2015, § 2, 12-21-15) 
Sec. 10-5-4. - Townhome (attached single-family) development guidelines. 
A.  Purpose. These guidelines are intended to promote the development of attractive townhome projects that integrate site layout, landscape elements and building architecture to introduce visual interest and avoid monotony. The guidelines are directed towards typical projects in a suburban setting. The concepts outlined in the guidelines are intended to provide for coherence and visual complexity (variety) in the buildings and site design. Rather than develop a set of fixed standards for townhomes, these guidelines provide flexibility for developers by allowing the use of different designs that address the guidelines. The guidelines serve as a framework for the review of townhome projects. This section is specific to townhome design issues; general requirements such as perimeter buffers, park land donations, street trees and other general development standards are contained elsewhere in the Subdivision and Zoning Codes. 
B.  Design Guidelines. Townhome developments will be required to have a design consistent with the following guidelines as set forth in this section, in addition to other requirements of the Village. These guidelines represent a minimum. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the authority to recommend alternative designs in addition to (or in substitution for) the guidelines, which equal or exceed the guidelines for final approval by the Village Board. The overall design of the townhome development may be considered in evaluating the appropriateness of specific design features. Additional requirements may be required by the Village Board at the time of subdivision or site plan approval. The overall design of the project should incorporate a mixture of the following elements to achieve a balanced design. 
C.  Homeowner's Association. A Homeowner's Association (HOA) shall be formed to, at a minimum, manage common landscape, pavement and water management areas that are contained within the development, other than those areas which may be accepted by the Park District or other body as approved by the Village Board. HOA documents shall be submitted at the time of subdivision review and shall include agreement to permit police enforcement of fire lane and no parking areas on private property, funding of common maintenance responsibilities and responsibility for private maintenance of the development. Notice regarding maintenance responsibilities for common areas by the HOA must be recorded so as to provide ongoing notice to future property owners. 
D.  Landscape Elements and Site Layout. The overall appearance of a project depends heavily on the building arrangement and the landscape design. The use of curved streets, both on-street and courtyard townhomes, and strategically placed landscape features should provide visual variety and interest. 
1.  Building Relationship to the Street and Street Layout. The orientation of townhome buildings to the street is of key importance in creating interest in the views from the street. This is most easily achieved by varying the orientation of the buildings to the street so that regular patterns are avoided. Variety is key in providing an interesting view. 
There are a number of means of achieving variety in the design. Curved streets that limit the length of views of rows of townhomes and create irregular spaces are an effective means of introducing such elements. Short public loop streets can also be used to limit views and create opportunities for landscape features. Courtyard buildings (off-street areas) are another approach. Courtyard buildings should not be placed parallel to one another. By placing courtyard buildings at varying angles to one another, and by varying those angles from one set of building to another, variety can be created within the development. No more than two buildings should be placed on a single courtyard. 
Particular attention should be applied to opportunities to provide landscape elements at principle street view termination points by the positioning of "gaps" between buildings and driveways to accommodate landscaped areas ("mini-parks"). The use of both on-street and courtyard (off-street) units can be used in conjunction with curved streets to create a visually dynamic site with limited apparent repetition. Articulated or "L" shaped buildings may be effective in certain situations. The variety introduced into the site by the building layout should balance the inherent uniformity of the townhome buildings. 
2.  Driveway Design and Landscaping. Minimizing the visual impact of the driveways in townhome developments is challenging due to their close proximity to one another. 
Courtyard designs provide off-street access to the garages of facing townhome structures. The use of shade trees in parking areas (courtyards) is critical in providing shade and a softening visual element for large areas of paving. Such tree placement should be designed for the purpose of reducing the apparent areas of paving, and provide for the maximum development of a tree canopy. As referenced in the discussion on the Building Relationship to the Street and Street Layout, the creation of a variety of irregularly shaped spaces in common access areas will help add interest, as well as areas for added green space. Pavement should be minimized while providing for 1) adequate parking in front of garages, 2) maneuvering area, and 3) emergency vehicle access, as required. Common driveway approaches should not be excessively long. 
The separation between driveways is of importance in both on-street and off-street designs. This is often an area where providing sufficient green space for a tree is a challenge. However, such a separation is quite influential in unifying the site, and reducing the dominance of the buildings and driveways. A significant physical and visual separation should be provided between adjacent driveways sufficient to support a shade tree. A minimum eight-foot wide green space should be provided between adjacent driveways. 
The use of shared driveway approaches (with separate parking in front of the garages) may be used to create added green space in the front yards in certain cases, such as with units that setback relative to other units in the building. Where feasible, grade variations between adjacent drives and the use of different paving materials or edge treatments (e.g. brick) should be used to add interest to the site. 
Curbing should be provided: 
a.  around all landscape islands in courtyard parking areas (except those between unit driveways), and 
b.  on the "nose" (adjacent to common driveways) of landscape islands adjacent to unit driveways in courtyard parking areas where there may be a risk of vehicles infringing into landscape areas. 
All courtyard shared driveways are not considered public streets and shall be separated from the public street by a concrete apron. All courtyards should avoid creating a "cut-through" path which would draw outside traffic through a courtyard shared driveway. Courtyards shall be constructed with the common driveways designed at a structural number of 2.5. Courtyards should have address range signs visible from the public street. 
3.  Trees Along Street Frontage of Courtyard Buildings. Landscaping in the open space between courtyard buildings and streets should provide filtered views of the building and courtyard parking areas. 
4.  Open Space. Open space should be used to create visual interest in the site and include a predominance of shade trees. A general minimum tree density is one shade tree (2.5 inch DBH) for every 1,500 square feet of landscape area (not including trees in parking areas, and street or access drive trees, as required elsewhere in this Code). A shade tree should be planted in the front yard of all units. While a variety of species and sizes of shade trees should predominate, some use of evergreen trees and ornamental trees should be incorporated into the design for variety and seasonal interest. Evergreen trees should be planted in groupings, rather than individually. The trees and open spaces should be well distributed throughout the site, and should include areas that can be utilized by residents. 
5.  Landscaping in Rear Yards. Rear yard landscaping should provide privacy to residents, as well as semi-private useable outdoor areas. 
6.  Grading and Topography. Relief in the topography of a site can be a useful tool in adding visual interest. A mix of unit exposures (at grade, walk-outs, and look-outs) as well as the creation of views can be another element in the site design process that creates variety on a site. 
7.  Guest Parking. Guest parking shall be provided as set forth in Section 10-5-2 of this Code. 
8.  Snow Storage. Snow storage shall be provided as set forth in Section 10-5-2-E of this Code. 
E.  Townhome Building Design. The appearance of townhomes from the street creates much of the character of townhome developments. Townhome developments are often dominated by views of driveways and garage doors. It is important to introduce variety into the appearance among the units in individual townhome buildings. There should be a balance among building materials, building articulation, and the use of architectural design elements. To some extent, increases in one of these factors can allow some trade-off against others. However, all of the factors should be addressed. Use of the following elements are recommended to achieve this variety. The inclusion of these elements is particularly critical where there are prominent views of the buildings from the street. 
1.  Use of a Variety of Architectural Design Elements. Vary the design elements of the front and rear of the units in a building. There should be two or more elements that vary among units for three or four unit buildings. Three or more elements should be provided for five or six unit buildings (e.g. dormers with and without windows, siding, brick, or an architectural medallion). Avoid repetition of the same element across a large number of units in the same building. Avoid identical buildings in the same view within the site or adjacent roadways. 
2.  Building Articulation. The design should include articulation of the front, rear and side (particularly for street facing units) building facades. Large expanses of undivided roof areas should be avoided. The division of the roof by varying the heights of the roof sections and the use of dormers are examples of common approaches to addressing this concern. The mass of the building should be varied to provide for visual complexity and interest. 
3.  Building Materials. A minimum of 25 percent of the front of the building should be brick. Brick should also be used to add visual interest to the rear elevation. Brick should be utilized in areas where it will be prominently viewed, and contribute to the overall appearance of the structure. The use of brick, in addition to another siding material, adds another color and texture to the building, improving its appearance. The meeting of materials should occur "naturally". For example, brick should not simply change to siding at an exterior corner. Rather, transitions such as at certain interior corners or in a "wrapped" corner to create a "column" are preferable. 
4.  Garages and Front Doors. Because the garage doors and driveways typically dominate the front of the townhome building, it is important to lessen their visual impact. The use of different building (facade) designs for adjacent garages can reduce the perceived predominance of the garage doors. Such designs can visually emphasize one garage and minimize the other, thus reducing apparent repetition in the design. Significantly, varying the projection of garages among units in a building can also help divide the mass of the building and create interest. Also, the use of two single garage doors, as well as double garage doors for two car garages adds variety. 
Front doors should be prominently visible to provide for both a human scale and a sense of security. 
5.  Style Integrity. The use of building materials and the building design should reflect a particular style. The inappropriate mixture of styles and materials should be avoided. 
6.  Building Size. Varying the number of units in a courtyard (off-street) buildings from three to six can aid in adapting to a site, as well as promote variety. A maximum of one in six buildings may contain six units. The number of units in a courtyard shall not exceed 11. In order to limit a large number of adjacent driveways (and curb-cuts), on-street buildings should be limited to four units (six if end-loaded units are used, so that access to any unit over four must be from the side). 
7.  Foundation (Building) Landscaping. Landscaping adjacent to the building should complement the architecture of the building, however, it should not substitute for architectural character. 
8.  Building Materials. Building materials shall be provided for as set forth in Section 10-5-[3]-H of this Code. Particular attention should be placed on selecting materials that will not be subject to premature deterioration or require excessive maintenance.

(Ord. No. 4360-2013, § 1(Exh. A), 3-18-13) 
Sec. 10-6-2. - Community impact statement. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. 
1.  A Community Impact Statement (CIS) shall be prepared in accordance with Village requirements. The purpose of the Community Impact Statement is to supplement site, landscaping, engineering, grading, architectural, and subdivision plans by providing the Village with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the community and its environment, and to list ways in which any adverse effects of such project might be minimized. The submission requirements under this Section are in addition to those listed elsewhere in Chapter 10 (Subdivision Code) (including the Landscape and Site Plan sections). The standards and requirements for preparing development plan documents, as referenced in this Code, shall be used in preparing appropriate sections of the Community Impact Statement regarding such documents. The Department of Development Services may waive the requirement for a Community Impact Statement where submission of such a study is not warranted due to the nature and/or scale of the application. 
B.  Scope. No person, firm or corporation shall engage in development or land disturbing activities without first providing a Community Impact Statement in accordance with the specifications and procedures hereinafter set forth. Elements of phased projects may be treated as separate projects with regard to the Community Impact Statement requirements. 
C.  Specifications/Procedures. 
1.  Community Impact Statement and Supplementary Community Impact Statement. The Community Impact Statement submission process is divided into two phases. Initially, the petitioner submits a Community Impact Statement which provides basic information regarding the effects of a project. 
Additional information may subsequently be required in the Supplementary Community Impact Statement based upon review of the Community Impact Statement and upon the nature of the project. 
2.  Pre-Application Conference. Before filing a Community Impact Statement, the developer may confer with the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services for the purpose of reviewing the procedures to be followed regarding the submission of a Community Impact Statement. 
3.  Submission of a Community Impact Statement. The developer shall complete and file with the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services a Community Impact Statement in conjunction with the submission of development plans. The applicant shall submit a CIS in accordance with procedures as outlined by the Department of Development Services. The Assistant Village Manager-Development Services shall review the Community Impact Statement and shall make one of the determinations listed below. Any appeal of the decision of the Assistant Village Manager-Development Services shall be made to the Village Manager. 
a.  The Assistant Village Manager-Development Services may determine that additional information is required due to possible impacts on the community and therefore require the submission of a Supplementary Community Impact Statement or additional information in the Community Impact Statement. The Assistant Village Manager-Development Services shall determine the scope of issues to be addressed in the Supplementary Community Impact Statement based upon the Community Impact Statement. 
b.  The Assistant Village Manager-Development Services may determine that no additional information beyond the Community Impact Statement is required with regard to probable impacts on the community and therefore does not require a Supplementary Community Impact Statement. 
4.  Referral. Both the Community Impact Statement and the Supplementary Community Impact Statement (if required) shall be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission as part of the petitioner's application. The Planning and Zoning Commission may request additional information during Planning and Zoning Commission review of the proposal.

A.  Pre-Approval Requirements. Prior to any administrative approval or approval of any site plan or subdivision by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Village Board of Trustees, the following supporting documents shall be submitted to the Village's Department of Development Services by the developer or owner. 
1.  A detailed statement setting forth the nature, kind, character and extent of all improvements that will be constructed in the subdivision or on the site as required by this Code, together with the complete plans and specifications thereof approved by the Village Engineer and with the agreement that the owner or developer will construct same in accordance therewith without expense to the Village. 
2.  A statement by a competent registered professional engineer of the State of Illinois giving an estimate of the total cost of the construction or installation of all such improvements. Such estimate shall be based on prevailing construction costs. 
B.  Post-Approval Requirements. After any administrative approval or approval of any site plan or subdivision by the Village Board of Trustees and before the issuance of any building permit, grading approval or other site development work, the following requirements must be met for all developments. The Assistant Village Manager-Development Services may reduce the requirements listed below for projects where the total value of the public and private improvements for the benefit of the public are less than $20,000.00 where other satisfactory means of assuring performance are provided. 
1.  In accordance with state statute, the developer or owner shall submit financial guarantees in a form acceptable to the Village which shall assure the Village of the completion of the improvements, including public improvements and private improvements (for the benefit of the public) and as required and specified on the approved development documents. All of the financial guarantee funds shall be available to the Village to remedy any deficiencies in the development that are not addressed by the developer. The distribution of the financial guarantee funds shall not be limited based upon any prior estimates or reductions in the financial guarantee funds. The amount of the financial guarantee funds shall be 110 percent of the estimated cost of the public improvements. In no case shall the financial guarantee funds be for an amount less than 25 percent of the cost of the private improvements for the benefit of the public.

_____ 
KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that we, the Principal(s) and Surety(ies) hereto, recite and declare that: 
1.  We are held and firmly bound to the obligee Village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois (hereinafter called "Village"), in the sum written above in lawful money of the United States of America, to be paid to the Village, its successors or assigns, for the payment whereof Principal(s), Co-Principals and Surety(ies) bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by this Bond. 
2.  The condition of this Bond is that if the Principal shall in every respect perform all of its obligations under the Development Documents identified above, which Development Documents are incorporated herein by reference, then this Bond shall be void; otherwise, the Bond shall continuously remain in full force and effect until released by the Village. Development Documents shall also include any annexation agreements, development agreements, plats, zoning approvals, engineering plans, site plans or other Village documents associated with the Project, including any laws, ordinances or governmental regulations related to the Project. 
3.  Surety waives all of its surety defenses including, but not limited to, the following: 
a)  It shall be the duty of the Principal to notify the Surety of any revision of the plans, profiles and specifications referred to in the Development Documents. The Surety expressly waives any right to receive notice from the obligee or to review or approve any revisions to the plans, profiles and specifications referred to in the Development Documents which are required to meet governmental standards. No such revisions of any kind in the work shall in any way affect the obligation of the Surety under this Bond; 
b)  The addition or reduction in subdivision lots or area to those shown in the original plat of subdivision, site plan or construction plan referred to in the Development Document shall in no way affect the obligation of the Surety under this Bond; 
c)  Any extension of time beyond the period provided for in the Development Document for completion of its obligations under the Agreement shall in no way affect the obligation of the Surety under this Bond; 
d)  The failure or refusal of Village to take any action, proceeding, or steps to enforce any remedy or exercise any right under the Development Document, or that taking of any action, proceeding, or step by Village, acting in good faith upon the belief that same is permitted by the provisions of the Development Documents, shall not in any way release Principal or Surety, or either of them, or their respective executors, administrators, successors, or assigns, from liability under this Bond. Surety hereby waives notice of any amendment, indulgence made, granted or permitted; 
e)  The Principal, Co-Principal and Surety intend that each provision of this Bond be valid and binding upon them and expressly agree to abide thereby; 
f)  In the event of a default of this Bond, the Village may terminate whatever rights Principal, Co-Principal and/or Surety may have to perform further work on the Project. 
g)  The requirement of any other entity to perform any obligations contained in the Development Documents shall in no way affect the obligations of the Surety under this Bond. 
4.  Default: 
a)  A default shall be deemed to have occurred on the part of the Principal if Principal shall fail to complete its obligations under the Development Documents within the time set forth therein or any extensions thereof; or, prior to the expiration of such period, if in the sole judgment of the Village, the Principal has: 
1)  Abandoned the performance of its obligations under the Development Documents; or 
2)  Renounced or repudiated its obligations under the Development Documents; or 
3)  Clearly demonstrated through insolvency, or otherwise, that its obligations under the Development Documents cannot be completed within the time allotted under the Development Documents. 
b)  If the Principal defaults in the performance of all or any part of the obligations specified in the Development Documents, the Village shall give written notice of the default to the Surety, with a copy to the Principal and Co-Principal, if any. In the event of such default and notice, Surety shall, within 45 days of receipt of the default notice, give written notice to the Village stating whether Surety will assume the Development Document obligations and the obligations of the Principal, and should it elect to assume said obligations, Surety shall be required to complete the obligations specified in the Development Documents according to its terms and provisions within 180 days of said notice, but not before expiration of the period provided for under the Development Documents and approved extensions thereof. In the event that Surety elects to assume the obligations of Principal as provided herein and thereafter fails to faithfully perform all or any part of the work, or should it unnecessarily delay all or any part of the work, then the Village may proceed as provided in Paragraph No. 5 of this Bond. 
5.  Should Surety following notice of default notify the Village that Surety elects not to assume the obligations of Principal under the Development Documents, or fails within 45 days of receipt of the default notice as provided in Paragraph No. 4b) above to notify the Village whether Surety elects to assume the obligations of Principal under the Development Documents, or having elected to assume the obligations of Principal, should it then fail to perform, then in any event the Village may elect any of the following procedures or any combination thereof: 
a)  Terminate whatever rights the Principal, Co-Principal and/or Surety may have to perform further work on the Project; 
b)  Take over or relet all or any part of the work under the Development Documents which is not completed and complete the same for the account and at the expense of the Principal and Surety, who shall be jointly and severally liable to Village for the costs incurred in completion of the obligations under the Development Documents and/or correction thereof. Such costs as identified in the Development Documents shall include, but not be limited to, construction, engineering, surveying, maintenance, donations, impact fees, deterioration, administration, supervision, reasonable attorney's fees, and any costs associated or related to any litigation of the Bond agreement and shall be adjusted for inflation. The amount of Village's actual costs for completion and/or correction of the work required under the Development Documents shall be conclusive of the extent of the liability of Principal and Surety and may exceed the Bond Amount; 
c)  Require the Surety to pay the Bond Amount to the Village as liquidated damages. 
6.  Should Surety, following notice of default notify the Village within 45 days of the receipt of the default notice choose to pay the Village for completion of the obligation under the Development Documents, the Surety shall have the right to demand that the Village state a sum constituting the estimated costs at that time, of completion and/or correction of the work required under the Development Documents, such as costs as defined in Paragraph No. 5b). Surety shall then immediately pay over to the Village the sum so stated and be released from any further obligations under this Bond. If funds are paid over under this section and the paid over funds are not sufficient to complete the work, the Village's sole remedy shall be to proceed against the Principal(s) and Co-Principals for any deficiency. If there are any paid over funds not necessary for completion of the work, the Village will return the excess to Surety after completion of the work. 
7.  If any action or proceeding is initiated in connection with this Bond and any and all obligations arising hereunder the venue thereof shall be in State Court in the County of Cook, State of Illinois, it is further understood and agreed that this contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, both as to interpretation and performance. 
8.  All notices sent to the Principal(s), Co-Principals, and Surety(ies) shall be sent to the address set forth on the signature page unless said Principal(s), Co-Principal(s) and Surety(ies) notify the Village in writing of any change. If the addresses of any of the Principal(s), Co-Principal(s) and Surety(ies) change, the Principal(s), Co-Principal(s) or Surety(ies) shall immediately notify the Village in writing of such change. Failure to notify the Village of any change in address is deemed to be a waiver of any requirement for notice under this Bond to the Principal(s), Co-Principal(s) or Surety(ies). All written notices to the Village required under the Bond shall be sent certified mail to the Village Clerk. 
9.  If any one or more of the provisions of this Bond are determined to be illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other provisions shall remain effective. 
10.  No party other than the Village shall have any rights under this Bond as against the Surety. 
11.  As part of the obligation secured hereby and in addition the Bond Amount specified herein, there shall be included costs, interest and reasonable expenses and fees (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and costs), incurred by the Village in successfully enforcing such obligations, to be awarded and fixed by the court. 
12.  Nonpayment of the premiums associated with this Bond will not invalidate this Bond nor shall Village be obligated for the payment thereof. Surety agrees to deliver written notice of non-payment under this Bond or other actions to the Village. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be signed and sealed as of the day and year set forth above.

A.  Public Streets. 
1.  If any plat of subdivision contains dedicated public streets or thoroughfares, whether located within or outside the Village's corporate limits, or contains existing streets outside of said corporate limits, the approval of the plat by the Village Board, or the subsequent annexation of the property by the Village, shall not constitute an acceptance by the Village of such streets or thoroughfares or of the improvements constructed or installed thereon or therein. Irrespective of any act or acts by an officer, agent or employee of the Village with respect to such streets or improvements, the acceptance of such streets or thoroughfares shall be made only by the adoption of a resolution by the Village Board, after there has been filed with the Village Clerk a certificate by the Village Engineer that all improvements required to be constructed or installed in, upon, or connecting to such streets or thoroughfares in connection with the approval of the plat of subdivision by the Village Board have been fully completed and the construction or installation thereof has been approved by them. The Village Engineer shall not file such certificate until after the following:

b.  Completion of an inspection of existing public streets within the subdivision and adjacent public streets used for ingress and egress to the subdivision but not limited to repairs and resurfacing cost for public streets within the subdivision and 50 percent of repairs and resurfacing cost for public streets used for ingress and egress to the subdivision. The Engineer shall then require such repairs or if it is cost-effective to repair in the future or repair is not immediately necessary, a cash in lieu payment for such repair shall be required. 
c.  A final inspection has been completed and the owner or developer has guaranteed said street and improvements for a period of one year from the date of acceptance. 
2.  Prior to filing the certificate, the Village Engineer will review the request and, if justified, will authorize and schedule a final inspection. Final inspections shall not be scheduled between November 1st and April 1st. All deficient improvements which do not totally conform to the engineering plans and this Code will be inventoried. The inventory of deficiencies will be forwarded to the developer for processing. When the deficiencies are corrected, a second inspection is[/]will be authorized. If the length of time between the first and second inspections is greater than two months or if the noted deficiencies are not correct at the time the second inspection is made, the request for acceptance will be cancelled. If cancelled, a second request letter will be required. Upon a second request for acceptance, the subdivider will be required to pay one and one-half times the appropriate engineering plan and review schedule of the field crew conducting the inspection, and the list of deficiencies recorded during the previous inspections will be voided and a complete reinspection is required. Final inspections will not be scheduled until the as-built plans have been reviewed and approved by the Village. 
3.  Improvements which require electrical energy for their operation such as street lighting shall not be approved until after a letter of request for the acceptance of such improvement.

2.  The Village Engineer shall not file such certificate until after the owner has requested acceptance of such private street or thoroughfare and the improvements constructed or installed therein or thereon and has filed a plat of dedication, a bill of sale, and a 12 month maintenance bond or letter of credit. Further, said certificate shall not be filed until a final inspection has been completed and the owner has guaranteed said street and improvement for a period of one year from the date of acceptance. 
3.  Prior to filing the certificate, the Village Engineer will review the request and, if justified, will authorize and schedule a final inspection.

ARTICLE 8. - FLOOD HAZARD AREAS 

Sec. 10-8-1. - Flood hazard area requirements. 
A.  Purpose. The purposes of the Section are to maintain the Village's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related land resources. This Section of the Municipal Code is intended to accomplish the following specific purposes: 
1.  To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/18(g), Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act; 
2.  To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
3.  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage; 
4.  To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding; 
5.  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations; 
6.  To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the Village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program; 
7.  To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended; 
8.  To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
9.  To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development. 
B.  Definitions. For the purposes of this Section of the Municipal Code, the following definitions are adopted:

a.  "Substantial Improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done. 
b.  The term does not, however, include either: 
1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

66.  Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
C.  How to Use Section 10-8-1 The Director of Engineering shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in Section 10-8-1-D. To fulfill those duties, the Director of Engineering first shall use the criteria listed in Section 10-8-1-E, Base Flood Elevation, to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the Director of Engineering must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain for which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the Director of Engineering shall require that the minimum requirements of Section 10-8-1-F be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Director of Engineering shall require that the minimum requirements of Section 10-8-1-G be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the Director of Engineering shall require that the minimum requirements of Section 10-8-1-H be met. 
In addition, the general requirements of Section 10-8-1-I shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of Section 10-8-1-F, 10-8-1-G, or 10-8-1-H. The Director of Engineering shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of Section 10-8-1-J. 
If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Director of Engineering shall review the requirements of Section 10-8-1-K to make sure they are met. In addition, the Director of Engineering shall complete all notification requirements. 
In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required by this Section of the Municipal Code, the Director of Engineering may take any and all actions as outlined in Section 10-8-1-M. 
D.  Duties of the Enforcement Official. The Director of Engineering shall be responsible for the general administration and enforcement of this Section of the Municipal Code, which shall include the following: 
1.  Determining the Floodplain Designation. Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted which drains more than one square mile. Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile), indicating that the development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining Sections herein. 
2.  Professional Engineer Review. If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one square mile, then the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer (P.E.) under the employ or contract of the Village for review to ensure that the development meets the requirements of Section 10-8-1-G or 10-8-1-H. In the case of an Appropriate Use, the P.E. shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of Section 10-8-1-G. 
3.  Dam Safety Requirements. Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage potential in the event of failure. The construction or major modification of all Class I (high hazard) and Class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit. Some Class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off-channel detention basins that have an embankment are non-jurisdictional Class III dam. It is not required that IDNR/OWR "sign-off" on all non-jurisdictional Class III dams. A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is required. A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. 
4.  Other permit requirements. Ensure that any and all required federal, state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit. 
5.  Plan Review and Permit Issuance. Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the Village meet the requirements of this Section of the Municipal Code, and issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the provisions of this Section and other regulations of this community when the development meets the conditions of this Section. 
6.  Inspection Review. Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Section of the Municipal Code and schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the inspection. 
7.  Damage Determinations. Make damage determinations of all damaged buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged structures which must comply with Section 10-8-1-I-3-c. 
8.  Elevation and Floodproofing Certificates. Maintain in the permit files of the Department of Code Enforcement an Elevation Certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a residential or non-residential building subject to Section 10-8-1-I, and/or the elevation to which a non-residential building has been floodproofed, using a Floodproofing Certificate, for all buildings subject to Section 10-8-1-I. 
9.  Records for Public Inspection. Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, Conditional Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Amendment and "as built" elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all buildings constructed subject to this Section of the Municipal Code. 
10.  State Permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to Sections 10-8-1-G and 10-8-1-H, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the Village. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the Village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR: 
a.  Organizations which are exempt from this Section of the Municipal Code, as per the Illinois Compiled Statutes; 
b.  IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in Section 10-8-1-B-16 and all other state, federal or local unit of government projects, including projects of the Village and County, except for those projects meeting the requirements of Section 10-8-1-G-2-a; 
c.  An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, per Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-5); 
d.  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-4); 
e.  Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage as indicated in Section 10-8-1-G-2-c (G-2-c-1), G-2-c-2), G-2-c-8)); 
f.  Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly navigable rivers, lakes and streams; 
g.  Any changes in the mapped floodway or published flood profiles. 
11.  Cooperation with Other Agencies. Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this Section of the Municipal Code. Submit data to IDNR/OWR and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for proposed revisions of a designated map within six months whenever a modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain map. Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program. Notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of any proposed amendments to this Section. 
12.  Promulgate Regulations. Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this Section of the Municipal Code, subject however to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any changes to this Section. 
E.  Base Flood Elevation. The protection standard for this Section of the Municipal Code is based on the Flood Insurance Study for the Village. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other resources. When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any development of the site. 
1.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of Salt Creek, Tributary A of the West Branch of Salt Creek, Higgins Road Tributary to Tributary A of the West Branch of Salt Creek and St. Michael's Tributary to Salt Creek, Poplar Creek, East Branch of Poplar Creek, and Schaumburg Branch of Poplar Creek shall be delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study for Cook and Kane Counties prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008 and August 3, 2009, respectively and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
2.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook and Kane Counties that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the Village shall be delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and of Kane County prepared by FEMA and dated August 3, 2009, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
3.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook and Kane Counties. 
4.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook and Kane Counties shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I, HEC-HMS, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. For a non-riverine SFHA, the Base Flood Elevation shall be the historic Flood of Record plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study. For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile) which has been identified by the Director of Engineering pursuant to Section 10-8-1-D-1, the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in Section 10-8-1-E-1. 
F.  Occupation and Use of Flood Fringe Areas. Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of this Section of the Municipal Code. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this Section, along with the requirements of Section 10-8-1-I. 
1.  Development Permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the Director of Engineering. 
a.  Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Director of Engineering. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations, using the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of Section 10-8-1-I. 
b.  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Director of Engineering shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map without a permit as required by this Section is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this Section of the Municipal Code. The Director of Engineering shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification. 
c.  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance. 
d.  The Director of Engineering shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant, copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The Director of Engineering shall not issue a permit unless all other local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
2.  Preventing Increased Damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
a.  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
b.  Compensatory Storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
3.  Construction of the Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE). A person who has obtained a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the Village to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The Director of Engineering shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all criteria set forth in the following subsection. 
a.  Compensatory storage shall be provided per Section 10-8-1-F-2-b. 
b.  The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the Flood Protection Elevation (FPE). 
c.  The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the Director of Engineering may waive the ten-foot minimum setback if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the Director of Engineering for review. The Director of Engineering may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback be less than four feet. 
d.  The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the Director of Engineering may waive the 20-foot minimum setback distance if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the Village for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
e.  The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes. 
f.  The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction. 
g.  All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions. 
h.  The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five feet below the BFE. 
i.  There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of 1/4 horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure. 
j.  The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow. 
k.  All foundations elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices. 
l.  If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the Director of Engineering may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only of the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer. 
m.  In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed 18 inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted. 
G.  Occupation and Use of Designated Floodways. This Section applies to proposed development, redevelopment, site modification or building modification within a designated floodway. The designated floodway for Salt Creek, Tributary A of the West Branch of Salt Creek, Higgins Road Tributary to Tributary A of the West Branch of Salt Creek, St. Michael's Tributary to Salt Creek, Poplar Creek, East Branch of Poplar Creek, and Schaumburg Branch of Poplar Creek shall be as delineated on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook and Kane Counties and referenced in Section 10-8-1-B-26. Only those uses and structures will be permitted which meet the criteria in this Section. All floodway modifications shall be the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the project. The development shall also meet the requirements of Section 10-8-1-I.

A Licensed Professional Engineer, under the employ or contract of the Village, shall review and approve applications reviewed under this Section. 
2.  Preventing Increased Damages and a List of Appropriate Uses. 
a.  The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are Appropriate Uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity, be a threat to public health and safety and welfare, impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this Section of the Municipal Code. Only those Appropriate Uses listed in 17 IL Adm. Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The approved Appropriate Uses are as follows: 
1)  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
2)  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, and commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses. 
3)  Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls. 
4)  Underground and overhead utilities. 
5)  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall maximum) that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage. 
6)  Detached garages, storage shed, or other non-habitable accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage. 
7)  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto. 
8)  Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either: 
(a)  The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot; or 
(b)  The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
9)  Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive non-erosive slope toward a watercourse. 
10)  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
11)  The replacement, reconstruction or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to 50 percent or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
12)  Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios and second story additions. If the building is improved to 50 percent or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
b.  Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an Appropriate Use. 
c.  Within the designated floodway, the construction of an Appropriate Use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a licensed professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of Section 10-8-1-I. 
1)  Preservation of Flood Conveyance, so as Not to Increase Flood Stages Upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
(a)  Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.) 
(b)  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative land cover. 
(c)  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(i)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water shall be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one-foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
(ii)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water shall be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one-foot horizontal for every one-foot of the flooded stream's length. 
(iii)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
(iv)  Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
(v)  All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
2)  Preservation of Floodway Storage so as Not to Increase Downstream Flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure. 
3)  Preservation of Floodway Velocities so as Not to Increase Stream Erosion or Flood Heights. For all Appropriate Uses, except bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures. 
4)  Construction of New Bridges or Culvert Crossings and Roadway Approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared with the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver. 
(a)  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in Section 10-8-1-E. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models. 
(b)  Lost floodway storage must be compensated per Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-2). 
(c)  Velocity increases must be mitigated per Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-3). 
(d)  If the crossing is proposed over public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a IDNR/OWR permit must be received. 
(e)  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed designated profile must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by Section 10-8-1-G-2. 
(f)  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-8). 
5)  Reconstruction or Modification of Existing Bridges, Culverts, and Approach Roads. 
(a)  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
(b)  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
(c)  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 17 IL Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to the IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
6)  On-Stream Structures Built for the Purpose of Backing Up Water. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared with the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in Section 10-8-1-B-16 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(a)  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention; 
(b)  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
(c)  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
(d)  A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
(e)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 10-8-1-G. 
7)  Floodproofing of Existing Habitable, Residential and Commercial Structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
8)  Excavation in the Floodway. When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other Appropriate Uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(a)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water shall be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one-foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length; and 
(b)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water shall be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one-foot horizontal for every one-foot of the flooded stream's length; and 
(c)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used; and 
(d)  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
9)  If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(a)  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
(b)  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
(c)  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
(i)  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
(ii)  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
(iii)  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
(iv)  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
(v)  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
(vi)  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
(vii)  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
(viii)  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
(ix)  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
(x)  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
(xi)  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
(d)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 10-8-1-G. 
10)  Seeding and Stabilization Plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
11)  Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
(a)  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
(b)  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
(c)  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
(d)  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels. (See Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-16).) Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
(e)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
12)  Public Flood Control Projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this Section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
13)  General Criteria for Analysis of Flood Elevations. 
(a)  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in Section 10-8-1-E, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
(b)  If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this Section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
(c)  If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this Section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
14)  Conditional Letter of Map Revision. If the Appropriate Use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR. 
15)  Professional Engineer's Supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer. 
16)  For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
(a)  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
(b)  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an Appropriate Use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
17)  After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an Appropriate Use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built" plans. 
d.  Development Activities in Delegated Communities Requiring State Review. For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway: 
1)  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-4). 
2)  An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-5). 
3)  Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-(1), 2), 8)). 
4)  The construction of any IDNR/OWR projects, dams (as defined in Section 10-8-1-B-16) and all other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the municipality or county. 
5)  An engineer's determination that a proposed bridge affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller opening. 
6)  Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood profiles. 
7)  Projects in public bodies of water. 
e.  Other Permits. In addition to the other requirements of this Section of the Municipal Code, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. No correspondence from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the project meets the requirements of Regional Permit 3. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated this responsibility to the Village. 
f.  Permits for Dams. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in Section 10-8-1-B-16 per 17 Illinois Administration Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the Director of Engineering finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the Director of Engineering shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office. If the Director of Engineering finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Director of Engineering shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA). 
g.  Activities That Do Not Require a Licensed Professional Engineer's Review. The following activities may be permitted without a licensed professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this Section of the Municipal Code, including the mitigation requirements. 
1)  Regional Permit 3 which authorizes, for example, underground and overhead utilities, storm and sanitary sewer outfalls, sidewalks, athletic fields, playground equipment, patios and stream bank protection activities. 
H.  Occupation and Use of SFHA Areas Where Floodways are not Identified. In SFHA or floodplains, (including AE, AH, AO and Unnumbered A Zones) where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than one square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
1.  Development Permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body, not exempted by state law, shall commence any development in a SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the Director of Engineering. 
a.  Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Director of Engineering. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing: property line dimensions; existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevations of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of Section 10-8-1-I. The application for a development permit shall also include the following information: 
1)  A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose, and intended use. 
2)  Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn to scale, on the designated floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area. 
3)  Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity. 
4)  Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a minimum: 
(a)  A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic or numerical scale, and north arrow. 
(b)  A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the structure or work, elevations using the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross-sections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale. 
(c)  Cross-section views of the project perpendicular to the flow of floodwater and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, ten-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and 
(d)  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.

b.  Based on the best available existing data according to federal, state or other sources, the Director of Engineering shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to Section 10-8-1-E-4. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map Identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this Section of the Municipal Code. The Director of Engineering shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification. The Director of Engineering shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The Director of Engineering shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
2.  Preventing Increased Damages. No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this Section of the Municipal Code. 
a.  Within all riverine SFHA's where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply: 
1)  The developer shall have a Licensed Professional Engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations, and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of Section 10-8-1-G-2-c-1) through 10-8-1-G-2-c-9) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the provisions of Section 10-8-1-E-4. As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for acceptance as a designated floodway. Upon acceptance of the floodway by IDNR/OWR and FEMA, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of Section 10-8-1-G for the designated floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to the definition in Section 10-8-1-B-17. 
2)  A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains an IDNR/OWR permit or a determination has been made that an IDNR/OWR permit is not required. 
3)  Permits for Dams. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in Section 10-8-1-B-16 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the Director of Engineering finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the Director of Engineering shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office. If the Director of Engineering finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Director of Engineering shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA). 
b.  The following activities may be permitted without a Licensed Professional Engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and designated floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this Section of the Municipal Code:

13)  Special Uses of Public Waters meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR Statewide Permit No. 14. 
14)  Any development determined by IDNR/OWR to be located entirely within a flood fringe area shall be exempt from State Floodway permit requirements. 
c.  The flood-carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
d.  Compensatory Storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
I.  Permitting Requirements Applicable to All Floodplain Areas. In addition to the requirements found in Sections 10-8-1-F, 10-8-1-G, and 10-8-1-H for development in flood fringes, designated floodways, and SFHA or floodplains where no floodways have been identified, the following requirements shall be met:

3.  Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and channels. Wherever possible, the floodplains shall be included within parks or other public grounds. 
4.  The Board of Trustees shall not approve any Planned Unit Development (PUD) or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits unless such agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this Section of the Municipal Code. 
5.  All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages. 
K.  Variances. 
1.  No variances shall be granted to any development located in a designated floodway as defined in Section 10-8-1-B-[17]. Whenever the standards of this Section of the Municipal Code place undue hardship on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Village Manager for a variance. The Village Manager shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit his recommendation to the Board of Trustees. The Village may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the flood protection intent of this Section. 
a.  No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met: 
1)  The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA; and 
2)  An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not granted; and 
3)  The relief requested is the minimum necessary; and 
4)  There will be no additional threat to public health, safety, beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation of a nuisance; and 
5)  There will be no additional public expense for flood protection, lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to stream beds and banks, roads, utilities, or other public facilities; and 
6)  The provisions of Sections 10-8-1-F-2 and 10-8-1-H-2 shall still be met; and 
7)  The activity is not in a designated floodway; and 
8)  The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and 
9)  The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the area involved including existing stream uses; and 
10)  All other required state and federal permits or waivers have been obtained. 
b.  The Director of Engineering shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of Section 10-8-1-I that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will: 
1)  Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 per $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
2)  Increase the risks to life and property; and 
3)  Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that the applicant will acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and liability. 
c.  Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in Section 10-8-1-B-33 "Historic Structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of Sections 10-8-1-K-1-a and 10-8-1-K-1-b, subject to the conditions that: 
1)  The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure; and 
2)  The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being removed as a certified historic structure. 
L.  Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Section of the Municipal Code is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Section does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This Section does not create liability on the part of the Village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this Section or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
M.  Penalty. 
1.  If such owner fails after ten days' notice to correct the violation: 
a.  The Village may make application to the Circuit Court for an injunction requiring conformance with the Municipal Code or make such other order as the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with the Municipal Code. 
b.  Any person who violates this Section of the Municipal Code shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in accordance with Section 7-[12]-1 of the Hoffman Estates Municipal Code for each offense, plus damages. Said damages shall include costs of property damage, restoration costs, and administrative costs. 
c.  A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. 
d.  The Village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the property. 
2.  The Director of Engineering shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended. 
a.  The Director of Engineering is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing, shall indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit. 
b.  The stop-work order shall remain in effect until compliance or a resolution has been achieved by the permittee to the approval of the Director of Engineering. 
3.  Nothing herein shall prevent the Village from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. 
N.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This Section of the Municipal Code is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this Section and other ordinances, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. This Section of the Municipal Code is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was adopted to meet the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, but is not intended to repeal the resolution which the Village passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program. 
O.  Severability. The provisions and sections of this Section of the Municipal Code shall be deemed separable and the invalidity of any portion of this shall not affect the validity of the remainder.

B.  Conveyance of Land. Prior to conveyance to any Park District or School District of any land, the intended grantee shall be furnished with an environmental audit prepared by an environmental consultant acceptable to the grantee assuring the grantee that there are no "Hazardous Substances" (as hereinafter defined) on or under the property. The term "Hazardous Substance" includes without limitation: 
1.  Those substances included in the definitions of "hazardous substances", "extremely hazardous substances", "hazardous materials", "toxic substances", "toxic chemicals", "toxic wastes", "hazardous chemicals", "hazardous wastes", or "solid waste" in CERCLA, SARA, RCRA, HSWA, TSCA, OSHA and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 1801, et seq., as amended and as they may be amended in the future, and in the regulations promulgated pursuant to said laws.

C.  School Donations. School sites shall be dedicated and school construction funds shall be donated, in accordance with the following criteria: The ultimate number of students that will be generated by a proposed subdivision shall be determined in accordance with Table 1. 
1.  Criteria for Requiring School Site Dedication. The amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites shall be directly related to the ultimate number of students to be generated by the proposed subdivision. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by dividing (i) the estimated number of children in each of the school age classifications set forth in Table 1 that will be generated by the proposed subdivision, by (ii) the recommended maximum number of students that can be served in the type of school which corresponds to the particular school age classification, as set forth in Table 2 below, and then multiplying the foregoing derived quotient by (iii) the recommended minimum number of acres for a school site for each school age classification, as set forth in Table 2. The product derived by the immediately foregoing multiplication calculation shall constitute the number of acres for elementary, junior and high school purposes in order to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated number of increased children in each school age classification as a result of the development of the proposed subdivision. 
a.  School Classification and Size of School Site. School classifications and size of school sites within the Village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
TABLE 2 
School Classification by Grade Minimum Number of Students for Each Such School Classification Minimum Number of Acres of Land for Each School Size of Such Classification Elementary Schools Grades 
Kindergarten through 6 600 students 11 Junior High Schools Grades 
7 and 8 1,200 
students 29 High Schools, Grades 
9 through 12 2,500 
students 55  
b.  Location. School sites shall be located in the Village in accordance with plans heretofore or hereafter adopted by the School District. If the School District has not planned a school site within the proposed subdivision or in the neighborhood in which such subdivision is located, the school site shall be so located as to be readily accessible to the greatest number of children projected for such neighborhood. 
c.  Site Suitability. The subdivider or developer, at its own cost or expense, shall provide the School District soil boring data, soil compaction test results and such other engineering studies, data and information pertaining to the proposed school site which the School District may request to enable it to determine the suitability of the proposed to-be-dedicated land for school site purposes. The School District shall have the right to reject any site which the School District determines, in accordance with sound engineering practice, is not suitable to school site purposes. 
d.  Improvements. Each school site shall be located on a fully improved street with curbs, gutters, sidewalks, street lights, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water, electricity and gas available at the property lines. The site shall have direct access to such a fully improved street across at least 20 percent of the distance of its perimeter. Any pedestrian access route shall be at least 30 feet wide and any vehicular access route or easement shall be at least 66 feet wide. Any pedestrian access route less than 50 feet wide shall be fenced with fencing material approved by the school district. To minimize conflicts, adequate provision for all forms of transportation shall be made, including pedestrians, buses, automobiles, and bicycles. 
2.  Cash Donations for School Construction. The amount of cash required to be donated to provide the necessary funds for the construction or expansion of school facilities in the Village for the use of the children who will be generated by a proposed subdivision shall be determined by multiplying the estimated ultimate number of school age children to be generated by the proposed subdivision determined on the basis of the demographic information set forth in Table 1, times $1,023.00. The $1,023.00 base school construction donation shall be adjusted in proportion to any increases or decreases in the cost of construction, as determined by the cost index published in the Engineering News Record (the ENR cost index), or, if that index is no longer published, in some other recognized index. 
a.  All funds collected by the Village pursuant to this sub-section C-2, whether by the Village or by the School District, shall be used solely for construction of schools in the Village of Hoffman Estates or serving residents of the subject subdivision. "School construction" shall mean and include: (i) school site improvements, (ii) new building design and construction, (iii) design and construction of building additions and improvements, (iv) instructional and classroom equipment and classroom furniture, and (v) library books and materials. In no event shall such funds be used for salaries or other personnel expenses or for schools not serving the subject subdivision. If any portion of the funds is not expended for the purposes set forth in this paragraph within ten years from the date of their receipt, then they shall be refunded to the subdivider or developer who donated them. 
b.  Funds contributed by a subdivider or developer for school purposes, including cash donations in lieu of land pursuant to section G below, shall be deposited with the Village Treasurer to be held in the Developer donation fund and paid without interest to the School District on a semi-annual basis. These funds shall not be used for any purpose other than as stated in this section C and as stated in section G. The School District must submit annual reports which include a detailed accounting of all expenditures using the Village's developer donation funds and the fund balance. 
D.  Criteria for Park and Recreation Land Dedication. 
1.  Criteria for Acceptance. The land or site for Park and Recreation land dedication must be suitable for the purpose for which it is intended. Land set aside by developers for parks, recreation and conservation purposes shall not be what has been left over after residential, commercial and industrial development has been designated and shall not include retention, detention or creek properties. 
2.  Requirement and Population Ratio. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be five and one-half acres of land per 1,000 of ultimate population dedicated to active use. "Active park areas" shall be defined as those areas specifically adapted and planned for a wide range of physical activity such as group games, physical education, sports, and athletics. Facilities usually include, but are not limited to, playfields, game courts, rinks, ball diamonds, pools, tennis courts, community centers and play apparatus. Active areas shall not include any areas designated for water management, such as retention, detention or "wetland" areas. 
3.  Improvements. Each park site shall be located on a fully improved street with curbs, gutters, street lights, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water, electricity, and gas available at the property lines. Sidewalks shall be provided along all street frontage. The site shall have direct access to a fully improved street across at least 20 percent of the distance of the perimeter. At least two access routes or easements shall be provided. Any pedestrian access route shall be at least 30 feet wide and any vehicular access route or easement shall be at least 66 feet wide. Any pedestrian access route less than 50 feet wide shall be fenced along both sides with fencing material approved by the park district.

4)  Seeding should be done on moderately dry soil on a seed bed which will easily accept and nurture germination of seeds. 
5)  Developer shall be responsible for making necessary reparation to the site caused by erosion. Reparations shall be completed prior to acceptance by the Park District. 
5.  Water Management Areas. Water Management areas shall be defined as those properties set aside as retention, detention or wetland. The Park District shall have no obligation to accept the donation of said parcels. The Park District may determine on a case by case basis whether or not any water management area should be accepted by the District in addition to the active park area included under sub-section D-2. 
E.  School and Park Plat Review. Copies of each subdivision plat shall be transmitted to the School District and the Park District for their written recommendations at the same time that they are transmitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission, but nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring receipt of a recommendation prior to action by the Corporate Authorities of the Village.

Sec. 13-5-5. - Filing of declaration.

At such time as a deed or instrument is presented to the Department, a certificate setting forth the facts which justify exemption shall be presented.

Any person so using and affixing a stamp shall cancel it and so deface it as to render it unfit for reuse by marking it with his initials and the day, month and year when the affixing occurs. Such marking shall be made by writing or stamping in indelible ink or by perforating with a machine or punch; however, the stamp shall not be so defaced as to prevent ready determination of its genuineness. 
Sec. 13-5-8. - Recordation of deeds. 
    No deed conveying real property within the corporate limits of the Village shall be entitled to recordation by the Recorder of Deeds for Cook County or for Kane County, or the Registrar of Titles of Cook County, Illinois, unless such deed shall bear either a Village Real Estate Transfer Tax stamp or an exemption mark from the Finance Department.

B.  In the event the Village is the prevailing party in an action to foreclose upon the lien created by Section 13-5-14 or is the prevailing party in an action to collect such tax, interest and penalties imposed pursuant to this Article, the Village shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and costs related to any such action.

The lien shall expire only at such time as the outstanding tax, interest and penalties are paid in full, the lien is foreclosed, or the period of bringing a foreclosure action described in Section 13-5-14(C) expires. 
B.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to give the Village's lien a preference or priority over the rights of any bona fide purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanics lienor, mortgagee or judgment lien creditor arising or existing prior to the recording of an instrument evidencing the Village's lien with the recorder of deeds of Cook County or Kane County, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Village's lien, whether or not recorded, shall have priority over any interest in the real property, including any lien, acquired by a person in connection with the person providing financing to the transferee taxpayer (or the taxpayer's nominee or designee) for the acquisition of the real property. The absence of tax stamps in the proper amount on the deed, assignment or other instrument of transfer pursuant to which the transferee taxpayer acquired title to, or beneficial interest in, the real property shall constitute constructive notice of the Village's lien to the person providing financing. 
C.  The Village may not commence an action to foreclose upon the lien more than seven years after the transfer giving rise to the tax liability; provided, however, that the running of the seven-year period shall be tolled for the duration of any judicial order enjoining or restraining the Village from instituting a foreclosure proceeding.

Said sum shall be paid to the Village within 21 days after the date of issuance of an invoice for same. 
H.  The Village Manager, or his or her designee, may promulgate such further or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of this Article, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to time and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered pursuant to Section 14-2-2 of this Article of such regulations.

Sec. 14-2-7. - Penalties.

Sec. 14-2-8. - Enforcement. 
    Nothing in this Article shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this Article. 
Sec. 14-2-9. - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

Upon reasonable prior written notice, during normal business hours at Grantee's principal business office, the City shall have the right to inspect the Grantee's financial records used to calculate the Village's franchise fees or PEG fees; provided, however, that any such inspection shall take place within the time period specified in the Village's generally applicable Taxpayer Rights and Responsibilities Ordinance, from the date the City receives such payment, after which period any such payment shall be considered final. 
2.  Upon the completion of an independent audit by the Village, the Village shall provide to the Grantee a final report setting forth the Village's findings in detail, including any and all substantiating documentation. In the event of an alleged underpayment, the Grantee shall have 30 days from the receipt of the report to provide the Village with a written response agreeing to or refuting the results of the audit, including any substantiating documentation. Based on these reports and responses, the parties shall agree upon a "Finally Settled Amount." For purposes of this Section, the term "Finally Settled Amount(s)" shall mean the agreed upon underpayment, if any, to the Village by the Grantee, or overpayment to the Village by the Grantee as the case may be, as a result of any such audit. If the parties cannot agree on a "Final Settlement Amount," the parties shall submit the dispute to a mutually agreed upon mediator within 60 days of reaching an impasse. In the event an agreement is not reached at mediation, either party may bring an action to have the disputed amount determined by a court of law. 
3.  Any "Finally Settled Amount(s)" due to the Village as a result of such audit shall be paid to the Village by the Grantee within 30 days from the date the parties agree upon the "Finally Settled Amount." Any overpayment by the Grantee to the Village shall be credited against subsequent franchise fee payments by the Grantee to the Village until such time as the overpayment is fully credited; or shall be paid by the Village to the Grantee within 30 days from the date the parties agree upon the "Finally Settled Amount" in the event no subsequent franchise fee payments are due to the Village. In the event Grantee or the Village does not pay the "Finally Settled Amount" within 30 days, Grantee or the Village shall be charged and shall pay, in addition to the amount due, interest on the amount due equal to the prevailing prime rate plus 200 basis points of interest compounded daily from the due date for payment of the "Finally Settled Amount." 
D.  Books and Records. 
1.  Access to Books and Records. Upon 14 days' notice to Grantee, the Village or its designated independent representative shall have the right to examine books and records reasonably related to Grantee's compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, including the fees described in Sections 14-3-5-A and 14-3-10-G of this Agreement. The Village shall have no right to examine any aspect of the books and records that does not reasonably relate to Grantee's obligations under this Agreement. 
2.  Confidentiality and Proprietary Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature. The Village agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to those employees, representatives, and agents of the Village that have a need to know in order to enforce this Franchise Agreement and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of all such information. For purposes of this Section, the terms "proprietary or confidential" include, but are not limited to, information relating to the Cable System design, customer lists, marketing plans, financial information unrelated to the calculation of Franchise Fees or rates pursuant to FCC rules, or other information that is reasonably determined by the Grantee to be competitively sensitive. Grantee may make proprietary or confidential information available for inspection but not copying or removal by the Village's representative. Village's representative will sign a reasonable confidentiality agreement. In the event that the Village has in its possession and receives a request under a state "sunshine," public records, or similar law for the disclosure of information that the Grantee has designated as confidential, trade secret or proprietary, the Village shall notify Grantee of such request and cooperate with Grantee in opposing such request to the extent permitted by law and at Grantee's expense. Grantee shall indemnify and defend the Village from and against any claims arising from the Village's opposition to disclosure of any information Grantee designates as proprietary or confidential.

Sec. 14-3-6. - Transfer of cable system or franchise or control of grantee. 
A.  Neither the Grantee nor any other Person may transfer the Cable System or the Franchise without the prior written consent of the Village, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No transfer of control of the Grantee, defined as an acquisition of 51 percent or greater ownership interest in Grantee, shall take place without the prior written consent of the Village, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No consent shall be required, however, for (i) a transfer in trust, by mortgage, hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the Grantee in the Franchise or in the Cable System in order to secure indebtedness, or (ii) a transfer to an entity directly or indirectly owned or controlled by Comcast Corporation. Within 30 days of receiving a request for consent, the Village shall, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, notify the Grantee in writing of the additional information, if any, it requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee or new controlling party. If the Village has not taken final action on the Grantee's request for consent within 120 days after receiving such request, consent shall be deemed granted. As a condition to granting of any consent, the Village may require the transferee to agree in writing to assume the obligations of the Grantee under this Franchise Agreement. 
B.  Insolvency. Any transfer of control resulting from or after the appointment of a receive or receivers or trustee or trustees, however denominated, designated to take over and conduct the business of the Grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of a 120-day period, shall be treated as a transfer of control pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 537 and require the Village's/City's consent thereto in the manner described in Section 14-3-6-A.

1.  The Grantee shall not indemnify the Village for any liabilities, damages, costs or expense resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence of the Village, its officers, employees and agents.

B.  Grantee's Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have 30 days from the receipt of the Village's written notice: (i) to respond to the Village, contesting the assertion of noncompliance or default; or (ii) to cure such default; or (iii) in the event that, by nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the Village of the steps being taken and the projected date that the cure will be completed and request additional time from the Village to complete the cure. 
C.  Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the Village determines that the Grantee is in default of any material provision of the Franchise, the Village may: 
1.  Seek specific performance of any provision that reasonably lends itself to such remedy or seek other relief available at law, including declaratory or injunctive relief; or 
2.  In the case of a substantial or frequent default of a material provision of the Franchise, declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked in accordance with the following: 
a)  The Village shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the Franchise on the basis of a pattern of noncompliance by the Grantee. The notice shall set forth with specificity the exact nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee shall have 90 days from the receipt of such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the Village has not received a response from the Grantee or upon receipt of the response does not agree with the Grantee's proposed remedy, it may then seek termination of the Franchise at a public hearing. The Village shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least ten days prior to such public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to request termination of the Franchise. 
b)  At the designated hearing, the Village shall give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, present evidence and question witnesses, after which it shall determine whether or not the Franchise shall be terminated. The public hearing shall be on the record and an audio/video recording shall be made. A copy of the recording shall be made available to the Grantee within ten business days after the hearing. The Grantee may, at its own expense, arrange for a written transcript of the public hearing. The decision of the Village shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Grantee by certified mail. The Grantee may appeal such determination to any court whose jurisdiction includes Cook County, Illinois. 
D.  Remedies Not Exclusive. In addition to the remedies set forth in this Section, the Grantee acknowledges the Village's/City's ability pursuant to Section 14-3-4-A of this Franchise Agreement to enforce the requirements and standards, and the penalties for non-compliance with such standards, consistent with the Cable and Video Customer Protection Law; and, pursuant to Section 14-3-3-A of this Franchise Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to permit the Village to exercise such rights and remedies in a manner that permits duplicative recovery from, or payments by, the Grantee. Such remedies may be exercise from time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Village. 
(Ord. No. 4125-2009, § 1, 8-3-09) 
Sec. 14-3-10. - Public, educational and governmental (PEG) access. 
A.  PEG Capacity. Grantee shall provide capacity, at no charge to the Village for the Village's noncommercial public, educational and governmental ("PEG") access programming through Grantee's Cable Service consistent with the requirements set forth herein. As of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Grantee provides three channels ("the PEG Channels") for utilization by the Village. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Village and the Grantee, and consistent with applicable law, two of the PEG Channels may be offered on the Grantee's Basic Digital Tier of Service. 
B.  Initial Channel Assignment. As of the effective date of this Agreement, the PEG channels described in Section 14-3-10-A above have been assigned by the Grantee to channel numbers 6, 18 and 19 on the basic service tier on the Grantee's Cable System. 
C.  Relocation. If during the term of this Franchise Agreement, the Grantee initiates a channel line-up change that results in the relocation of PEG programming from channel 6, the Grantee, in addition to providing the Village with at least 30 days' advance notice of the change, shall reimburse the Village for its reasonable and documented costs of changes to "channel-marked items," such as logos, stationery, envelops and business cards necessitated by such line-up change in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Further, the Grantee agrees to cooperate with the Village to notify subscribers of the channel relocation through reasonable promotional assistance (subject to the Grantee's operational requirements applicable thereto) such as a message included on billing statements or the inclusion of an insert in the Grantee's billing statements as may be provided by the Village to the Grantee's billing services provider. The foregoing shall not apply to changes that are beyond Grantee's control, such as a television station under federal law requiring carriage on a channel currently used by a PEG channel. 
D.  Comcast Access Facility Usage. To the extent the Grantee operates and maintains public access studio facilities and equipment in the metropolitan Chicago area, Grantee agrees that these facilities and equipment will be available to residents of the Village on a first-come, non-discriminatory basis for the production of public access programming consistent with the Grantee's public access rules and procedures. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the Grantee to operate or maintain any public access studios or equipment. 
E.  Enhancing PEG Access. The Grantee and the Village further agree to work in cooperation to explore other economically and technically feasible means by which PEG access utilization and programming can be delivered in a digital format. 
F.  Origination Point. At such time that the Village determines that it wants the capacity to allow subscribers in the Village to receive PEG access programming which may originate from Schools and/or Village facilities (other than those having a signal point of origination at the time of the execution of this Agreement); or at such time that the Village determines that it wants to establish or change a location from which PEG programming is originated; or in the event the Village wants to upgrade the connection to the Grantee from an existing signal point of origination, the Village will give the Grantee written notice detailing the point of origination and the capability sought by the Village. The Grantee agrees to submit a cost estimate to implement the Village's plan within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer than 60 days from when Grantee receives all necessary information regarding the work sought. After an agreement to reimburse the Grantee for its expenditure, the Grantee will implement any necessary system changes within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer than 60 days. 
G.  PEG Access Funding. 
1.  At its sole discretion, the Village may designate PEG access projects, including the origination point described in Section 14-3-10-F above, to be funded by the Village through pass through funds collected by the Grantee as follows. The Village shall send written notice of the Village's desire for Grantee to collect as an external charge a PEG Capital Fee of up to $0.35 per customer per month charge to be passed on to each Subscriber pursuant Section 622(g)(2)(C) of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. §542(g)(2)(C)). The notice shall include a description of the intended utilization of the PEG Capital Fee for PEG Access Channel facilities and/or equipment. The Grantee shall collect the external charge over such period as is mutually agreed upon by the Village and the Grantee, and shall make the PEG Capital Fee payments from such sums at the same time and in the same manner as Franchise Fee payments. The payments shall be expended only for costs associated with PEG access as permitted by applicable law. Said PEG Capital Fee shall be imposed within 120 days of the Village's written request. 
2.  For any payments owed by Grantee in accordance with this Section 14-3-10 which are not made on or before the due dates, Grantee shall make such payments including interest at an annual rate of two percent over prime lending rates as quoted by Chase Bank U.S.A. or its successor, computed daily from time due until paid. Any undisputed overpayments made by the Grantee to the Village shall be credited upon discovery of such overpayment until such time when the full value of such credit has been applied to the Franchise Fee liability otherwise accruing under this section. 
3.  Grantee and Village agree that the capital obligations set forth in this Section are not "Franchise Fees" within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 542. 
H.  Rules and Procedures for Use of PEG Access Channels. The Village shall be responsible for establishing and enforcing rules for the non-commercial use of public, educational and governmental access channels and to promote the use and viewership of the channels. 
I.  Editorial Control. Grantee shall not exercise any editorial control over any use of PEG channels, nor shall Grantee or its Affiliates incur any criminal or civil liability pursuant to the federal, state or local laws of libel, slander, obscenity, incitement, invasions of privacy, false or misleading advertising, or other similar laws for any programs carried on any PEG channel. 
J.  Allocation and Use of PEG Channel(s). 
1.  By Village. The PEG Channel(s) is(are), and shall be, operated by the Village, and the Village may at any time allocate or reallocate the usage of the PEG Channel(s) among and between different uses and users. 
2.  By Grantee. The Village shall adopt rules and procedures under which the Grantee may use the PEG Channel(s) for the provision of Video Programming if the PEG Channel(s) are not being used for their respective purposes pursuant to Section 611(d) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 531. 
K.  PEG Signal Quality. Provided PEG signal feeds are delivered by the Village to the designated signal input point without material degradation, the PEG channel delivery system from the designated signal input point shall meet the same technical standards as the remainder of the Cable System set forth in this Agreement. 
L.  Emergency Alerts. At all times during the term of this Franchise Agreement, the Grantee shall provide and maintain an "Emergency Alert System" ("EAS") consistent with applicable Federal law and regulation - including 47 C.F.R., Part 11 and the "State of Illinois Emergency Alert System State Plan" - as may be amended from time to time. The Village agrees to indemnify and hold the Grantee harmless from any damages or penalties arising out of the negligence of the Village, its employees or agents in using such system.

Chapter 15 - GOVERNMENTAL ETHICS 
ARTICLE 1. - POLICY AND PURPOSE 

Sec. 15-1-1. - Policy and purpose. 
A.  It is essential to the proper operation of democratic government that public officials be independent and impartial; that governmental decisions and policy be made through proper channels; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of government. Public officials, appointees and employees must serve their government in a fiduciary capacity and must not bestow special consideration upon any person merely because of that person's relationship to an official or employee. The attainment of these ends is impaired whenever there exists conflict between the private interests of a public official or employee and his duties as such. The public interest therefore requires that the law protect against such conflicts of interest and establish appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of elected officials, appointees and government employees in situations where conflict exist, as well as in situations where conflict might develop. 
B.  It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the government of those men and women who are best qualified to serve it. The right of each official, appointee and employee to privacy in their financial affairs must not, therefore, be limited beyond that disclosure necessary to ensure the integrity of government. Moreover, because an essential principle underlying the staffing of our government is that its officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, such opportunity should not be limited unless conflicts with the responsibility of such officials, appointees and employees to the public cannot be avoided. 
C.  It is the policy and purpose of this Chapter to implement these objectives of protecting the integrity of the Village of Hoffman Estates and of facilitating the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel by prescribing essential restrictions against conflicts of interest in municipal government without creating unnecessary barriers to public service and by establishing a Code of Ethics for officials, appointees and employees of the Village of Hoffman Estates.

(Ord. No. 4002-2008, § 2, 2-4-08) 
Sec. 18-3-3. - Action on permit applications. 
A.  Village Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Director of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of Public Works shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Director of Public Works is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of Public Works shall issue a permit as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. 
B.  Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications Retailers. 
1.  Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to commence work governed by this Chapter for facilities for the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the Village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed. 
2.  In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: 
(i)  Ten days after service of notice to the Village by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction; or 
(ii)  25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this Chapter. 
3.  Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a permit is required for work pursuant to Section 18-3-2 of this Chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements of Subsection A., of this Section. 
C.  Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007.

(Ord. No. 4002-2008, § 2, 2-4-08) 
Sec. 18-3-4. - Effect of permit. 
A.  Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this Chapter on Village rights-of-way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way. 
B.  Duration. No permit issued under this Chapter shall be valid for a period longer than 90 days. Construction must commence within a 90-day period from the date the permit was issued or a 90-day extension must be applied for. If construction fails to begin during the 90-day extension, a permit must be re-applied for and permit fees resubmitted. 
C.  Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this Chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners. 
D.  Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 4002-2008, § 2, 2-4-08) 
Sec. 18-3-5. - Revised permit drawings. 
    In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within 90 days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this Chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with Section 18-3-19 of this Chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. 
(Ord. No. 4002-2008, § 2, 2-4-08) 
Sec. 18-3-6. - Insurance. 
A.  Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in paragraphs 1 and 2 below: 
1.  Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than: 
a.  $5,000,000.00 for bodily injury or death to each person; 
b.  $5,000,000.00 for property damage resulting from any one accident; and 
c.  $5,000,000.00 for all other types of liability; 
2.  Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a combined single limit of $1,000,000.00 for personal injury and property damage for each accident; 
3.  Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and 
4.  Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000.00 per employee and per accident. 
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this Section. 
B.  Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this Section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss. 
C.  Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this Section to the Village within ten days following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village. 
D.  Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or not to renew." 
Within ten days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this Section. 
E.  Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by Subsection a) of this Section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under Subsection A., or the requirements of Subsections B., C. and D., of this Section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under Subsection A., of this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act. 
F.  Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. 
G.  Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be affected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois. [All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.] 
(Ord. No. 4002-2008, § 2, 2-4-08)

    By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this Chapter by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. 
(Ord. No. 4002-2008, § 2, 2-4-08) 
Sec. 18-3-8. - Security. 
A.  Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The Security Fund shall serve as security for: 
1.  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this Chapter; 
2.  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this Chapter; and 
3.  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this Chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this Chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to this Chapter or any other applicable law. 
B.  Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum: 
1.  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the permittee; 
2.  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and

C.  Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this Subsection C for any single phase. 
D.  Withdrawals. The Village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the 14 day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
1.  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
2.  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
3.  Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or 
4.  Fails to comply with any provision of this Chapter that the Village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund. 
E.  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in Subsection C of this Section. 
F.  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required in Subsection C of this Section. 
G.  Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this Chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
H.  Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this Chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
