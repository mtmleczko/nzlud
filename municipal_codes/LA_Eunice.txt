CODE OF ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF EUNICE, LOUISIANA

Published in June, 1978 by Order of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen

INTRODUCTION 
    This publication represents the first comprehensive revision and compilation of the general ordinances, resolutions and other legislative enactments of the City of Eunice, Louisiana. Under the authority granted by LRS 33:1361 et seq., the Mayor and Board of Aldermen directed that this codification be prepared for the general use and benefit of the citizens of the Eunice community. The Code was prepared under the general supervision of Mr. Wesley H. Clanton, City Attorney and Mr. James S. Duos, City Clerk, with research and editorial assistance provided by Marvin L. Lyons and Associates, Inc. 
    This Code contains all of the general and permanent ordinances and other legislative enactments of the City's governing body. In adopting this document, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen expressed its intent to repeal all general ordinances which were not included herein, save and except those whose repeal was specifically exempted in the Adopting Ordinance. Ordinances relating to special purposes, or having a limited life, such as enactments levying taxes or special assessments, providing for bond issues, vacating specified streets, etc. were not included. An enumeration of the types of ordinances which were not included and are therefore not affected is set forth in Section Four of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    In addition to local legislation, certain self-operative provisions of the Louisiana Revised Statutes and other state legislative material adopted by the City by reference were also included where such material added to the City laws on a particular subject or was needed to clarify an issue. 
    One of the main directives that the Mayor and Board of Aldermen gave to the staff engaged in this project was that it develop a publication that was not only factually correct and up to date, but also one that could be conveniently used by those trained in the law and lay persons as well. In responding to that directive, several things were done. 
    First, all of the minutes of the City's governing body were researched, back to the time of the City's incorporation. Material gathered from the records was then checked against state laws, court decisions and opinions of the Louisiana Attorney General for agreement and compliance. In some instances, new ordinances were adopted before the Code was finally enacted to bring the City's laws into compliance with state authority relating to the matter. 
    The material was then divided into subject matter groupings and those groupings were developed into chapters. The chapters were further divided into sub-chapters, parts, and sections in a manner intended to provide a logical sequence of provisions. Each chapter, sub-chapter and section was then appropriately titled or provided with a heading to facilitate easy reference and identification of the subject matter contained therein. 
    Following each section, in parentheses, is a note indicating the legislative source of the material therein contained. The source notes for the local legislation indicate the date the legislation was adopted, the section number within the legislation, if section numbers were employed, and a brief historical note explaining if the original enactment had ever been amended. Source notes which contain an LRS number mean that the material in that section was derived from the Louisiana Revised Statutes. The numbers that follow the LRS designation indicate the title and section from which the material was obtained. 
    Many chapter and sub-chapter titles, and sections are also followed by a "Comment" note. These notes were employed by the staff to cross reference sections of the code which related to one another, to refer the reader to the general source of authority by which the City had the power to enact such a provision and to otherwise add or provide information to the reader on a particular matter. These notes were especially prepared to save the user valuable time and effort in researching various provisions of the City's laws and to aid in construction and interpretation. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is similar to that followed in the Louisiana Revised Statutes. Each section number consists of the two parts, separated by a colon. The first part of the number refers to the chapter in which the material is located, and the second part, to the specific location of the material in the chapter. Thus, the first section in Chapter 1 is numbered Section 1:1, and the third section in Chapter 15 is numbered Section 15:3. The system was devised to enable the reader to more easily cite material, and/or locate material so cited. 
    The reader will also notice that occasionally, the editors have reserved certain section numbers within chapters, and always between sub-chapters. This was done to facilitate the inclusion of new material as such material is enacted in the future. Page numbers following sub-chapters and chapters have also been reserved for the same reason. 
    The Code also contains a comprehensively developed Word Index. Most of the provisions in the Code have been listed under several different headings in the Index to make the location of material as easy as possible. 
    The attention of the reader is also called to the special looseleaf format of this publication. This format was employed, also, to facilitate the inclusion and addition of new legislative material. Municipal governments are not static creatures, and from time to time, new ordinances will need to be adopted, and existing laws will need to be changed. As new legislation is enacted, supplements will be prepared and made available containing the new material. Holders of the Code are therefore urged to check with City officials from time to time concerning the availability of such supplements. 
    Finally, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen would like to take this opportunity to express its appreciation to Mr. Wesley H. Clanton, its City Attorney, Mr. James S. Duos, its City Clerk and to the officers and staff of Marvin L. Lyons and Associates, Inc. for the time and effort they put into this project. In particular, we would like to thank Mr. Marvin Lyons and Mr. William T. Kivett of the MLL staff, who served as project directors and editors; Mr. William J. Doran, Jr., attorney for MLL and editorial assistants, Lynne Hotstream, Sherry Buzzell and Jeannie Comeaux.

(Ord. No. 47-82, 4-13-82) 
Chapter 2 - ADMINISTRATION, ELECTIONS AND ORGANIZATION 
SUBCHAPTER A. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 2:1. - Corporate name. 
    The name of this municipality, duly incorporated under the laws of the State of Louisiana, is hereby fixed as the "City of Eunice." 
(Res. of 10-19-67; Gubernatorial Proclamation of December 6, 1967) 
Comment- In conformity with the provisions set forth in LRS 33:341, LRS 33:342, for classification of a municipality as either a "village," "town" or "city" based on population, the Resolution of 1967 certified Eunice to have a population in excess of five thousand (5,000) by taking of census. The Gubernatorial Proclamation of 1967 accordingly declared it officially a "city" instead of a "town." 
Sec. 2:2. - City to be governed by Lawrason Act. 
    The City of Eunice shall be governed by the provisions of LRS 33:321, et seq., which provisions are commonly known as the Lawrason Act. (Gubernatorial Proclamation of January 9, 1909) 
Comment- The municipality of Eunice, as indicated above, was incorporated as a town by proclamation of the governor following a referendum vote on March 20, 1908, which carried 107-4. As noted in this section, the city elected to be governed by the provisions of the Lawrason Act as cited, which act set forth a general legislative charter for Louisiana municipalities in order to provide a uniform type of government for municipalities.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 07-10(A), adopted July 16, 2010, amended part III in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, part III, §§ 5:50-5:71 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2-87, adopted February 10, 1987, and Ord. No. 498(B), adopted May 12, 1998. 

Sec. 5:50. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Louisiana has in statute LRS 38:84 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Eunice City Council of the City of Eunice, Louisiana, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 07-10(A), 7-16-10; Ord. No. 10-10(C), Art. I(A), 10-12-10) 
Sec. 5:51. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Eunice are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 07-10(A), 7-16-10; Ord. No. 10-10(C), Art. I(B), 10-12-10) 
Sec. 5:52. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 07-10(A), 7-16-10; Ord. No. 10-10(C), Art. I(C), 10-12-10) 
Sec. 5:53. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the bottom of the longitudinal structural I beam of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The bottom of the longitudinal structural I beam of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of subsection 5:64(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

Sec. 5:69. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5:56, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
(a)  have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or 
(b)  together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 5:64 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 07-10(A), 7-16-10; Ord. No. 10-10(C), Art. 5(D), 10-12-10) 
Sec. 5:70. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5:56, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of 5:66-5:72. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.

    If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this part is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this part. 
(Ord. No. 07-10(A), 7-16-10; Ord. No. 10-10(C), Art. 5(F), 10-12-10) 
Sec. 5:72. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this part and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this part by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this part or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than six (6) months, or both, for each violation. Each day the violation continues shall be deemed a new violation. In addition, the violator shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Eunice from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

Sec. 5:324. - New construction. 
    Proposals for new construction in the Eunice Historic District should seek compatibility with existing structures through the appropriate use of site planning, materials, decorative details, architectural elements and scale. A proposal should not draw unnecessary attention to itself in any one of these characteristics. However, a proposal need not duplicate or copy historic styles and periods. The architectural context is of primary concern. 
(1)  Scale. The relationship of the building and its elements (including doors and windows) to other structures in the district. It is important in considering scale, that a careful study be made of the height, width and mass of buildings in the immediate neighborhood and district as a whole. This study should serve to confirm or deny the appropriateness of the height, width and mass of the proposed building. Maximum Height of any new structure shall conform to U.S. Department of Interior guidelines for historic districts. In no case shall a new structure exceed a height of seventy-five (75) feet above the street. 
(2)  Sitting. The positioning of a building on a lot. This process includes determining the setback of a building, the spacing of this building from adjacent buildings, and the location of the walls, fences, walks, drives and landscaping, if any of these are used in the overall design. 
(3)  Materials. The surface building fabric which contributes to the exterior character and appearance of a building. 
(4)  Decorative details. Ornamentation or embellishment. These includes cornices, lintels, arches, balustrades, chimneys, shutters, columns, and other common details. When used, details should create a unifying effect on a building and should be compatible with the contest of the neighborhood. 
(5)  Architectural elements. Parts of a building that are integral to its composition. These include balconies, roofs, porches, chimneys, dormers, parapets and other parts of a building that contribute to its overall shape and silhouette. The choice and arrangements of elements of a proposed building should reflect those of other buildings in the neighborhood. The building should not draw unnecessary attention to itself by failing to relate to neighboring styles, but neither should it necessarily copy these styles. The object is to compliment the context of the Eunice Historic District. The Eunice Historic District Commission shall follow the guidelines established by the United States Department of the Interior in considering all proposals for new construction and/or rehabilitation. 
(Ord. No. 996(E), § 14, 9-27-96; Ord. No. 998(A), § 14, 9-8-98)

    The following fencing materials are not acceptable: Barbed wire, concrete block, stockade, plywood, hardboard, asbestos board or chain-link.

    No overhanging balconies or galleries of wrought or cast iron may be removed, but other new or additional balconies may be erected if they conform to the quaint and distinctive architecture of the Eunice Historic District. The permit for all such new construction or any renovation shall be subject to the requirements of this subchapter.

SUBCHAPTER A. - OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE TAX[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 3-80, adopted Nov. 10, 1981, amended Ch. 12 by repealing §§ 12:1-12:15, containing general provisions relative to occupational licenses and which derived from provisions enacted during original codification. In addition, Ord. No. 3-80 enacted new provisions which have been added as new §§ 12:1-12:6. 
Comment- Prior to the 1978 codification, the city followed the practice of readopting its occupational license levy annually. Rather than continue this, the mayor and board of aldermen directed that this subchapter be revised to make the levy perpetual thereby eliminating the need for such annual consideration. This subchapter therefore, as amended, represents a revision of the city's license ordinances developed from prevailing state law authorizations. 

Sec. 12:1. - Annual license tax. 
    There is hereby levied an occupational license tax for the year 1982 and for each subsequent year upon each person pursuing and conducting any business, trade, calling, profession or vocation within the corporate limits of the City of Eunice, subject to license under the Louisiana Constitution and laws of this state.

Sec. 12:3. - Exemptions, definitions, classifications; adoption. 
    For the purpose of this subchapter, the exemptions, limitations, definitions and classifications in effect on December 31, 1981, as provided in said statutes, as amended, and in any act hereinafter passed, amending same, are hereby adopted.

This rule may be tried out of term and in chambers and shall be tried by preference. If the rule is made absolute, the order therein rendered shall be considered a judgment in favor of the local governmental subdivision prohibiting the taxpayer from the further pursuit of the business therein until he has paid the delinquent tax, interest, penalties and costs, and every violation of the injunction shall be considered a contempt of court, punishable according to law. 
(Ord. No. 31-80, § 6, 11-10-81)

Editor's note- Section 4 of Ord. No. A-36 provided qualifications; however, those qualifications were in some respects antiquated and not in conformity with state law.

(Ord. No. A-324, §§ 1-6, Art. 1, Revised, 1-10-67; Ord. of 4-13-82) 
Comment- The actual language of the source material from which the above section was derived was slightly altered to fit the format of this Code. The penalty provision was also revised to conform to Section 1:21. 
Sec. 14:2. - Interpretation. 
    The sections of this subchapter cannot be extended by analogy so as to create crimes not provided for herein; however, in order to promote justice and to effect the objects of the law, all of its provisions shall be given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of their words, taken in their usual sense, in connection with the context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 2, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:3. - Civil remedies not affected. 
    Nothing in this subchapter shall affect any civil remedy provided by the law pertaining to civil matters, or any legal power to inflict penalties for contempt. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 3, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:4. - Crime defined. 
    A crime is that conduct which is defined as criminal in this subchapter. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 4, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:5. - Criminal conduct. 
    Criminal conduct consists of: 
(1)  An act or a failure to act that produces criminal consequences, and which is combined with criminal intent; or 
(2)  A mere act or failure to act that produces criminal consequences, where there is no requirement of criminal intent; or 
(3)  Criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 5, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:6. - Criminal consequences. 
    Criminal consequences are any set of consequences prescribed in the various sections of this subchapter as necessary to constitute any of the various crimes defined therein. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 6; 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:7. - Specific and general criminal intent. 
    Criminal intent may be specific or general: 
(1)  Specific criminal intent is that state of mind which exists when the circumstances indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. 
(2)  General criminal intent is present whenever there is specific intent, and also when the circumstances indicate that the offender, in the ordinary course of human experience, must have adverted to the prescribed criminal consequences as reasonably certain to result from his act or failure to act. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 7, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:8. - Criminal intent; how expressed. 
    The definitions of some crimes require a specific criminal intent, while in others no intent is required. Some crimes consist merely of criminal negligence that produces criminal consequences. However, in the absence of qualifying provisions, the terms "intent" and "intentional" have reference to "general criminal intent". 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 8, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:9. - Criminal negligence. 
    Criminal negligence exists when, although neither specific nor general criminal intent is present, there is such disregard of the interest of others that the offender's conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful man under like circumstances. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 9, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:10. - Insanity. 
    If the circumstances indicate that because of a mental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference to the conduct in question, the offender shall be exempt from criminal responsibility. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 10, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:11. - Intoxication. 
    The fact of an intoxicated or drugged condition of the offender at the time of the commission of the crime is immaterial, except as follows: 
(1)  Where the production of the intoxicated or drugged condition has been involuntary, and the circumstances indicate this condition is the direct cause of the commission of the crime, the offender is exempt from criminal responsibility. 
(2)  Where the circumstances indicate that an intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the presence of a specific criminal intent or of special knowledge required in a particular crime, this fact constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that crime. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 11, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:12. - Mistake of fact. 
    Unless there is a provision to the contrary in the definition of a crime, reasonable ignorance of fact or mistake of fact which precludes the presence of any mental element required in that crime is a defense to any prosecution for that crime. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 12, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:13. - Mistake of law. 
    Ignorance of any provision of this subchapter is not a defense to any criminal prosecution. However, mistake of law which results in the lack of an intention that consequences which are criminal shall follow, is a defense to a criminal prosecution under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Where the offender reasonably relied on an act of this municipality in repealing an existing criminal provision, or in otherwise purporting to make the offender's conduct lawful; or 
(2)  Where the offender reasonably relied on a final judgment of a competent court of last resort that a provision making the conduct in question criminal was unconstitutional. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 13, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:14. - Justification; general provisions. 
    The fact that an offender's conduct is justifiable, although otherwise criminal, shall constitute a defense to prosecution for any crime based on that conduct. This defense of justification can be claimed under the following circumstances: 
(1)  When the offender's conduct is an apparently authorized and reasonable fulfillment of any duties of public office; or 
(2)  When the offender's conduct is a reasonable accomplishment of an arrest which is lawful under the laws of the State of Louisiana or of this subchapter; or 
(3)  When for any reason the offender's conduct is authorized by law; or 
(4)  When the offender's conduct is reasonable discipline of minors by their parents, tutors or teachers; or 
(5)  When the crime consists of a failure to perform an affirmative duty and the failure to perform is caused by physical impossibility; or 
(6)  When any crime is committed through the compulsion of threats by another of death or great bodily harm, and the offender reasonably believes the person making the threats is present and would immediately carry out the threats if the crime were not committed; or 
(7)  When the offender's conduct is in defense of persons or of property under any of the circumstances described in Articles 19 through 22 of the Louisiana Criminal Code. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 14, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:15. - Use of force or violence in defense. 
    The use of force or violence upon the person of another is justifiable, when committed for the purpose of preventing a forcible offense against the person or a forcible offense or trespass against property in a person's lawful possession; provided that the force or violence used must be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent such offense, and that this section shall not apply where the force or violence results in a homicide. 
(Ord. No. 324, Art. 15, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:16. - Aggressor cannot claim self-defense. 
    A person who is the aggressor or who brings on a difficulty cannot claim the right of self-defense unless he withdraws from the conflict in good faith in such a manner that his adversary knows or should know that he desires to withdraw and discontinue the conflict. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 16, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:17. - Defense of others. 
    It is justifiable to use force or violence in the defense of another person when it is reasonably apparent that the person attacked could have justifiable used such means himself, and when it is reasonably believed that such intervention is necessary to protect the other person. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 17, 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:18. - Principals. 
    All persons concerned in the commission of a crime, whether present or absent, and whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, aid and abet in its commission, or directly or indirectly counsel or procure another to commit the crime, are principals. 
(Ord. No. A-324, Art. 18; 1-10-67) 
Sec. 14:19. - Attempt. 
    Any person, who, having a specific intent to commit a crime, does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense intended; and it shall be immaterial whether, under the circumstances, he could have actually accomplished his purpose. 
    Mere preparation to commit a crime shall not be sufficient to constitute an attempt; but lying in wait with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime, or searching for the intended victim with a dangerous weapon with the intent to commit a crime, shall be sufficient to constitute an attempt to commit the offense intended. 
    An attempt is a separate but lesser grade of the intended crime; and any person may be convicted of an attempt to commit a crime, although it appears on the trial that the crime intended or attempted was actually perpetrated by such person in pursuance of such attempt. 
    Whosoever attempts to commit any crime shall be fined or confined or both in the same manner as for the offense attempted; but such fine or confinement shall not exceed one-half of the largest fine or one-half of the longest confinement prescribed for the offense so attempted or both.

Comment- See note following Section 14:21. 
Sec. 14:79.1. - Transmission of false fire alarms by automatic fire detection and alarm transmission equipment; procedure for fire department response and exit; penalties. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to reduce the number of false fire alarms received from automatic fire alarm transmitting equipment, to allow for the more efficient mobilization and allocation of the resources of the fire department to provide effective response to actual fire situations instead of false fire alarms, and to prescribe penalties for the repeated transmission of false fire alarms by automatic fire detection and alarm transmission equipment. 
(b)  Definition of false fire alarm. For the purpose of this section, any signal transmitted by automatic fire detection and alarm transmission equipment which falsely indicates a fire shall be considered a false fire alarm, whether caused by equipment malfunction, by human error, or by any other means. The determination as to whether a fire has occurred or is in progress at the location of the alarm system shall be made by the fire officer in charge at that location. 
(c)  Procedure for fire department response to and exit from location of false fire alarm. Immediately following dispatch of the fire department by a monitoring facility, the monitoring facility shall attempt to contact a designated representative of the property at the location of the alarm system to grant access to the fire department to the interior of any structures on the property. If no access is granted to the Fire Department, the fire officer in charge shall conduct, or have conducted under his supervision, a nondestructive exterior investigation of the property to look for signs that a fire has occurred or is in progress. If the chief fire officer in charge at the location of the alarm system determines that no fire has occurred or is in progress at that location, the chief fire officer shall leave written notification of an alarm dispatch at the front entrance of the location. After leaving such written notification, the chief fire officer and any other personnel of the fire department at the location of the alarm system may leave the location. 
(d)  Penalties. The owner of any automatic fire detection or alarm transmission equipment which transmits more than three (3) false fire alarms from any one (1) location in any consecutive twelve-month period shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as follows: 
(1)  In any consecutive twelve-month period, three (3) false alarm signals shall be permitted without penalty. Upon receipt of the third false alarm within a consecutive twelve-month period, a letter shall be forwarded by the fire prevention division of the fire department to the owner of the premises, and to the alarm company which services the equipment if the company is known, which letter shall cite this section and give notice that there have been three (3) false fire alarms within a consecutive twelve-month period. 
(2)  For the fourth false alarm signal in any consecutive twelve-month period, the penalty shall be a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(3)  For the fifth false alarm signal in any consecutive twelve-month period, the penalty shall be a fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00). 
(4)  For the sixth or any subsequent false alarm signals in any consecutive twelve-month period, the penalty shall be a fine of three hundred dollars ($300.00). 
(e)  Revocation of certificate of occupancy. If the fire prevention division of the fire department finds that any structure with a certificate of occupancy has experienced six (6) or more false fire alarms in any consecutive twelve-month period, and that such false fire alarms constitute lack of a sufficient fire alarm which renders the structure especially liable to fire or dangerous to life, the fire prevention division of the fire department may order the revocation of any and all certificates of occupancy previously issued for said structure. If a certificate of occupancy is revoked in such a case, a certificate of occupancy shall not be reissued for the structure until such time as the fire prevention division of the fire department finds that sufficient fire alarm has been installed in and/or on the structure. 
(f)  Exceptions. 
(1)  False fire alarms resulting from malicious acts by persons not under the control of the owner or occupant of the building, and false fire alarms which are a direct result of acts of God, shall be exempted from subsections (d)and (3) of this section and shall not be counted when computing the number of false fire alarms during any consecutive twelve-month period. 
(2)  Automatic fire detection and alarm transmission equipment which experiences undetectable mechanical problems resulting in the transmission of false fire alarms shall be exempted from Subsections (d) and (3) of this section if the owner provides the fire prevention division of the fire department with verification from a service company specializing in such systems, which shall set forth the nature of the undetectable mechanical problem and the nature of the corrective measures being undertaken to address the problem. The exception established by this subsection (f)(2) shall only apply when the owner or occupant of the building in which a false fire alarm has occurred presents written proof to the fire department, in a form approved by the fire department, that the alarm system which transmitted the false fire alarm has been inspected and tested by a state-licensed fire alarm contractor, in accordance with applicable NFPA standards, within one-year prior to the false fire alarm. 
(g)  Fire department standby fee. If any fire department unit is kept at any premises, waiting for employees of the premises to open the premises for inspection, for a period of time exceeding one (1) hour, a standby fee shall be charged to the responsible party at the rate of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per hour for each succeeding hour or fraction thereof. 
(h)  [Proof of alarm testing.] Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the fire department, and the fire prevention division of the fire department, from requiring proof that any fire alarm has been fully tested by a state-licensed fire alarm contractor in accordance with applicable NFPA standards. The fire department, and the fire prevention division of the fire department, shall at all times have such authority. 
(i)  [Fire personnel remaining on location.] Nothing in this section shall require any personnel of the fire department to remain on the location of a fire alarm after the fire officer in charge at that location has determined that no fire has occurred or is in progress at that location. 
(Ord. No. 09-02(A), § 1(79(A)), 9-10-02)

(1)  Name or make. 
(2)  Model, name or number. 
(3)  Type of bicycle: 
a.  Boys or girls. 
b.  Racer, heavy-duty, delivery, standard. 
(4)  Colors. 
(5)  Serial number and its location. 
a.  Usually on the left side of the frame at bottom rear where wheel and axle meet frame; or 
b.  Under the pedal housing; or 
c.  On the upright bar below the seat. 
(6)  If a complete bicycle is not recovered, show "bicycle parts only" and list parts. 
(7)  If bicycle is not operable, so note. 
(g)  Disposition if needed for investigation or evidence. If a bicycle is needed for investigation or evidence, indicate this fact on the inventory to avoid having the bicycle disposed of automatically (at public auction approximately forty-five (45) days after the date of recovery). No tracers for disposition will be sent from the evidence and recovered property section unless the inventory is marked "Hold for Investigation or Evidence." Since the great majority of bicycles are not needed as evidence, and the forty-five (45) days are sufficient for the investigation conducted for bicycles, a great deal of proper work will be eliminated by automatic disposition. 
    If an owner is located after the bicycle has been sent to the evidence and recovered property section, notify the evidence and recovered property section. Record on the yellow copy of the inventory the date and name of the evidence and recovered property officer notified.

SUBCHAPTER A. - TRAFFIC REGULATIONS IN GENERAL 

Sec. 16:1. - Adoption of Louisiana Highway Regulatory Act. 
    Pursuant to the authority conferred by LRS 32:42, the provisions of LRS Title 32, Chapter 1, commonly referred to as the "Louisiana Highway Regulatory Act," as it may be amended from time to time, and all regulations of the State Department of Highways and the Director of Public Safety adopted pursuant thereto which govern the operation of motor vehicles, traffic, and streets are hereby adopted and made applicable to the operation of motor vehicles, traffic, and streets within the City of Eunice, except as such are in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter and except such as by their nature are inapplicable. 
Editor's note- Over the years, the city has adopted numerous ordinances dealing with motor vehicles and traffic. Many of these were determined to be archaic, contradictory and in conflict with related state laws. This subchapter, therefore, represents a complete revision of the city's traffic laws in an effort to up-date them and bring them into conformance with state statutes and authorities. 
State Law reference- Authority of municipalities to adopt the Louisiana Highway Act by reference, LRS 32:41; provisions of this Act, 32:1 et seq. 
Sec. 16:2. - Duty of operators to comply with highway regulatory act; requirements for vehicles; penalty for violations. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of persons owning, operating or having in charge or under their control or custody any vehicle including a bicycle or motorcycle, upon the streets, highways and roads within the City of Eunice, and all pedestrians, to observe and conform to the provisions, rules, and regulations of the Highway Regulatory Act as supplemented by the provisions of this subchapter and any other ordinance of this city providing with respect thereto and they are subject to the penalties provided in section 1:21 of this Code, if they do not observe and comply with such rules and regulations. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful to operate any vehicle on any public way in this city which does not fully comply with all the requirements of the Louisiana Highway Regulatory Act pertaining to lights, brakes, other equipment, safety devices, inspection, construction or maintenance. 
Editor's note- The general provisions contained in the above section render a number of earlier ordinances dealing with traffic obsolete. These include Ord. No. 77, June 14, 1913; Ord. No. 149, Sept. 2, 1924; Ord. No. 157, Sept. 1, 1925 and Ord. No. A-12, Nov. 8, 1929. 
State Law reference- Similar state law requirements, LRS 32:51, 32:52 and 32:53. 
Sec. 16:3. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this subchapter, the words and phrases used in the Louisiana Highway Regulatory Act shall have the meaning ascribed to them in R.S. 32:1, with the exception that: 
(1)  Where the words "department" or "department of highways" are used, they shall be deemed to include the mayor and board of aldermen of the City of Eunice, unless the meaning clearly indicates otherwise. 
(2)  Where the words "department of public safety" are used, they shall be deemed to include the mayor and board of aldermen and the police department of the City of Eunice, unless the meaning clearly indicates otherwise. 
Sec. 16:4. - Mayor and board of aldermen to inspect streets and set maximum tonnage allowed thereon; penalties. 
(a)  The mayor and board of aldermen shall inspect all streets, lanes and public ways of the city and shall prescribe the necessary regulations and the maximum vehicular tonnage permitted to travel thereon. 
(b)  The mayor shall be responsible for seeing that clear and understandable signs are erected at the entrance or entrances to said streets, lanes and public ways designating the prescribed regulations and maximum tonnage of any vehicle traveling thereon. 
(c)  Any person traveling upon any street, lane or public way in violation of such prescribed regulations and maximum tonnage shall be condemned to pay all damages to said streets, lanes and public ways caused by him and also be subject to the penalties provided for in section 1:21 of this Code. 
Comment- Over the years, the city has established numerous limited-application traffic regulations governing specific streets and/or locations and dealing with such matters as load limits, speed limits, parking regulations, yield intersections, etc. For example, Ord. No. A-132 of March 16, 1954 established truck routes on certain streets; Ord. No. 20-70 of Oct. 13, 1970 prohibited trucks weighing in excess of five (5) tons from using Prairie Avenue; and Ord. No. A-256 of Jan. 8, 1963 prohibited trucks over three-fourths ton from using a portion of Fuselier Street. 
Because of the general authorizations contained in this chapter providing for the establishment of special traffic regulations and the enforcement of same after signs giving notice of the regulations are erected, the specific requirements of these special limited-application ordinances were not included in this codification. This omission does not reflect the intent of the mayor and board of aldermen to repeal these ordinances, but rather to obviate the necessity for making frequent amendments to this publication for matters that do not affect the entire municipality. 
Cross reference- For additional provisions of this Code pertaining to streets, see Ch. 23. 
Sec. 16:5. - Truck routes. 
(a)  Designation generally.

Comment- The various amending ordinances revised the boundaries of the congested areas. 
The preamble to Ord. No. A-85 set out the purpose of the regulations established therein as follows: 
"WHEREAS, the volume of traffic on the streets in certain sections of the Town of Eunice, Louisiana, has the effect of congesting the streets and impeding the movement of traffic, and 
"WHEREAS, the numerous operators of motor vehicles park on the streets of Eunice in the congested areas for unreasonably long periods of time, too near to other parked vehicles so parked on the most congested parts of the Town's busiest streets, and 
"WHEREAS, such practices retard orderly and even shopping intervals, impede traffic and constitute a danger to persons and property of motorists and pedestrians, and 
"WHEREAS, the mayor and board of aldermen of the Town of Eunice, Louisiana, are agreed that the best method by which these conditions may be remedied is by the designation of individual parking spaces in the area so congested, by restricting parking in said areas to reasonable intervals of time and by the compelling of operators of vehicles who use the parking space so designated to pay a portion of the cost of establishing and maintaining the same, and 
"WHEREAS, attempts to regulate traffic and parking in the congested areas have proved not as successful as desirable for the reason that adequate policing of this problem by the Police Department alone requires a larger number of officers for such work than can be spared from other necessary functions of the Police Department: 
"NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED..."

(b)  In approving the above listed uses the governing body will be guided by the following standards: 
(1)  Any use which emits odors, gas, or dust which are unpleasant, obnoxious, or injurious to health, will be required to design and construct necessary buildings, enclosures, filtering systems, or other facilities necessary for eliminating or reducing the intensity or concentration of such odors and/or dust to a level which will not be detrimental to zoned residential districts close to the particular use. In determining what is "detrimental" inspection of similar facilities operating in other locations with particular attention to the appearance and condition of adjacent residential area will assist the governing body in making a determination. Study of court decisions involving cases where damage has been claimed by residents living near such odor or dust emitting plants may be used as an instrument to interpret this paragraph. 
(2)  Proper provision must be made for storage of raw materials and wastes to prevent unsanitary conditions or the breeding of flies, insects, and rodents. A safeguard against such conditions may be the requirement to store such materials in tight buildings of binds. 
(3)  If the industrial operation requires above-ground storage of explosive materials, the industry may be required to acquire sufficient land area surrounding the plant to minimize danger to people and property adjacent to the industry. A similar requirement may be established for an industry engaging in an activity which creates noise or vibrations.

SUBCHAPTER D. - AIRPORT ZONING 

Sec. 18:300. - Zoning regulations established on property surrounding Eunice Municipal Airport; public policy established. 
    This subchapter is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by Act 118 of 1944 (LSA-R.S. 2:381, et seq.). It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of Eunice Municipal Airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking-off, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of Eunice Municipal Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared: (1) that the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Eunice Municipal Airport; (2) that it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety and general welfare that the prevention of these hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation. It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.

Sec. 18:302. - Airport zones established. 
(a)  In order to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the Instrument Approach Zones, Noninstrument Approach Zones, Transition Zones, Horizontal Zone and Conical Zone. Such areas and zones are shown on Eunice Municipal Airport Zoning Map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Lindsey J. Aucoin, Civil Engineer, and dated June 15, 1965, which is on file in the office of the city clerk. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Noninstrument approach zone. A noninstrument approach zone is established at each end of all noninstrument runways on Eunice Municipal Airport for noninstrument landings and take-offs. The noninstrument approach zone shall have a width of two hundred fifty (250) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of two thousand two hundred fifty (2,250) feet, at a distance of ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet beyond each end of the runway, its center line being the continuation of the center line of the runway. 
(2)  Transition zone. Transition zones are hereby established adjacent to each instrument and noninstrument runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones symmetrically located on either side of runways, having variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward from a line one hundred twenty-five (125) feet on either side of the center line of the noninstrument runway, for the length of such runway plus two hundred (200) feet on each end, and are parallel and level with such runway center lines. The transition zones along such runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven (7) feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are established adjacent to noninstrument approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths, as shown on the zoning map. Such transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of such zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven (7) feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is hereby established as the area within a circle with its center at the Airport Reference Point and having a radius of five thousand (5,000) feet. The horizontal zone does not include the noninstrument approach zones and the transition zones. 
(4)  Conical zone. A conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a distance of three thousand (3,000) feet. The conical zone does not include the transition zones. 
(Ord. No. A-291, § 3, 6-18-65, as amended by Ord. No. A-347, 12-12-67) 
Comment- The amending ordinance corrects an error in Paragraph (1) by changing "noninstrument runways on take-offs" to "noninstrument landings and take-offs". 
Sec. 18:303. - Airport zoning regulations, height limitations. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone created by this subchapter to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such zone. Such height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Noninstrument approach zones. One foot in height for each twenty (20) feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from and at the elevation of the end of the noninstrument runway and extending to a point ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway; 
(2)  Transition zones. One foot in height for each seven (7) feet in horizontal distance beginning at any point one hundred twenty-five (125) feet normal to and at the elevation of the center line of noninstrument runways extending two hundred (200) feet beyond each end thereof, extending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation which is forty-two (42) feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one foot vertical height for each seven (7) feet horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces; 
(3)  Horizontal zone. One hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or a height of one hundred ninety-two (192) feet above mean sea level; and 
(4)  Conical zone. One foot in height for each twenty (20) feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone, extending to a height of three hundred (300) feet above the airport elevation. 
    Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitations shall prevail. 
    Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to forty-five (45) feet above the surface of the land. 
(Ord. No. A-291, § 4, 6-18-65, as amended by Ord. No. A-347, 12-12-67) 
Comment- The amending ordinance changed "one foot in height for each forty (40) feet in horizontal distance" to "one foot in height for each twenty (20) feet in horizontal distance" in Paragraph (1) and changed "extending to a height of three thousand (3,000) feet above the airport elevation" to "extending to a height of three hundred (300) feet above the airport elevations in Paragraph (4). 
Sec. 18:304. - Airport zoning regulations; use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subchapter, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this subchapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking-off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(Ord. No. A-291, § 5, 6-18-65) 
Sec. 18:305. - Airport zoning regulations, nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this subchapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of June 18, 1965, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which has begun prior to June 18, 1965, and is diligently prosecuted, particularly nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting or impairing any construction, either proposed or hereafter proposed, at the site occupied by the Louisiana State University at Eunice. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the administrative agency to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City of Eunice. 
(Ord. No. A-291, § 6, 6-18-65) 
Sec. 18:306. - Airport zoning regulations, use permits required; variances. 
(a)  Future uses: Except as specifically provided in Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone. 
(2)  In the areas lying within the limits of the noninstrument approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such instrument or noninstrument approach zone. 
(3)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this subchapter except as set forth in Section 18:303. 
(b)  Existing uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on June 18, 1965 or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed: Whenever the administrative agency determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this subchapter, may apply to the board of appeals for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this subchapter. 
(e)  Hazard marking and lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this subchapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the administrative agency at the expense of the City of Eunice, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

(Ord. of 9-13-77) 
Comment- As an explanation for the need, the above-cited ordinance was prefaced with the following provisions: 
"WHEREAS, there are many customers or consumers whose gas meter[s] within the city limits of the City of Eunice, which[,] for a number of obvious reasons, are located at the dwelling or at a point where the customer's line enters [a] place or building where the gas is to be used or consumed; and 
"WHEREAS, the private line of a consumer or owner from the city's supply line to the meter is often in a state of serious disrepair, which results in a loss of much gas to the City of Eunice, which is uncompensated for, and which may result in danger of accident; and 
"WHEREAS, [the] city has no right to enter upon the private property, and excavate and repair the line of a consumer or owner, and it is[,] of course, not the obligation of the city to do so; and 
"WHEREAS, in order to eliminate such loss and any related danger, the city has elected to notify the consumer or owner[,] as herein provided for, where such disrepair and danger is discovered to give the customer fifteen (15) days' written notice in which to renew or repair the customer's line to a state that it will be loss free, and in the event the consumer[s] or owners failure to do so, the city will discontinue service. 
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED..." 
Sec. 25:21. - Repair of natural gas lines outside of corporate limits; location of meters; allocation of costs. 
(a)  The City of Eunice, having recently completed a study of its gas distribution system beyond the city limits, shall replace or extensively repair gas line or lines belonging to the city and located beyond the city limits and will make certain replacements or extensive repairs to certain line or lines to comply with the findings and recommendations of the experts employed by city to conduct such survey or surveys. 
(b)  On such outside of corporate limits, lines or meters shall be moved and/or installed on the main line belonging to city at the point where the service lines of a customer joint to the main line, insofar as possible. 
(c)  An accurate accounting of the cost of installation and operation of the line shall be maintained to the end that the expense for the installation of any such lines or extensive repairs shall be employed in the regulation of price or prices of the gas to the customers, and such adjustment shall be that necessary to reimburse the city for such expenditure or expenditures within that period for installation or repair through December, 1996. 
(d)  The necessary and proper devices and check meters shall be installed and maintained so as to be accurate throughout the period from installation to and through December, 1996. 
(Ord. of 9-13-77) 
Comment- The above-cited ordinance contained the following preface explaining the need for its adoption: 
"WHEREAS, the City of Eunice for some 40 years has owned and operated its own natural gas utility system, which includes the ownership of pipelines and the distribution of natural gas to its customers; and 
"WHEREAS, as authorized and permitted by law, the system lies both within the corporate limits and without the corporate limits; and

"WHEREAS, the foregoing being true, the city must discontinue service, make major repairs, or install the new lines and increase rates to the end that the expenditures needed in the installation of the new lines will pay out for the installation and operating cost within the life of its present gas purchase contract, which expires in December, 1979.

In this case, the city may go upon the property for the purpose of repairing the line. 
(c)  Should the property owner refuse to grant right-of-way, including the necessary trench and installation essential to service, or should the property owner refuse to make installation of plastic line or its equivalent upon his property, the city may refuse natural gas service or the city may move or locate the meter, regulator and other necessary apparatus to the property line common to private ownership and public ownership, and furnish service, but not until the consumer or property owner, as the case may be, executes an instrument of release exempting the city from all liability for any injury to himself, his family, invitees or guests on his properties that may occur upon the property as a result of the furnishing of gas. In any event, the city shall not be liable for any injury of any kind to persons or property which occurs or originates downstream of the meter.
