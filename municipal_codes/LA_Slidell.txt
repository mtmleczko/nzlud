PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Slidell, Louisiana. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 Code, as supplemented through August 11, 1998, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Tim Mathison, City Attorney, Mr. Davis Dautreuil, Council Administrator/Clerk of the Council, and Ms. Wanda Beelman, Administrative Assistant, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

C.  With the final approval of ordinances by the mayor, or the council in case of a veto by the mayor, such enacted ordinances shall be published in full in the official journal by the clerk of the council as soon as practical thereafter provided, however, that ordinances adopting codes of technical regulations or adopting or amending the operating budget or capital improvement program may be published in full or in summary at the council's discretion.

B.  1.  Within seven (7) calendar days after the mayor's receipt of an ordinance, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and city holidays, it shall be returned to the council administrator with the mayor's approval, or with the mayor's veto. If the proposed ordinance is not signed or vetoes by the mayor within seven (7) days after receipt, it shall be considered approved.

D.  The right of the mayor to veto as provided in this section shall apply to all ordinances adopted by the council except those which propose amendments to this charter; reapportion council districts; establish, alter or modify council procedure; appropriate funds for auditing or investigating any part of the executive branch; or those ordinances requiring council action pursuant to the general laws of the state or which the council has received specific approval to enact following a referendum vote of the people.

Each emergency ordinance shall contain a specific statement of the emergency claimed. 
B.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2-12 (Submission of Ordinances to the Mayor), any emergency ordinance adopted by the council shall be signed by the presiding officer of the council and presented to the mayor within six (6) hours after adoption. Within twelve (12) hours after the mayor's receipt of an emergency ordinance, it shall be returned to the council administrator with the mayor's approval, or with the mayor's veto. If the emergency ordinance has been approved, it shall be considered finally enacted and become effective immediately upon receipt by the council administrator. If the emergency ordinance is vetoed, the mayor shall submit to the council through the council administrator, a written statement of the reasons for the veto. The council administrator shall record upon the emergency ordinance the date and hour of its delivery to and receipt from the mayor. Should the council vote to readopt the vetoed emergency ordinance by the favorable vote of at least two-thirds of its authorized membership, said emergency ordinance shall be considered finally enacted and become law immediately upon readoption, irrespective of the veto by the mayor. Upon final approval by the mayor, or the council in case of a veto by the mayor, such enacted emergency ordinance shall be published in the official journal by the council administrator as soon as practical thereafter either in full or in summary at the discretion of the council. 
C.  Emergency ordinances shall be effective for no longer than thirty (30) days. The council, however, upon a favorable vote of at least a majority of the authorized membership may extend the life of an emergency ordinance for an additional thirty (30) days, but no such ordinance may be extended beyond that period.

(b)  Designation as a landmark would qualify a structure for the same historic tax credits, tax abatements, and grants authorized to one located in a preservation district. 
(c)  Therefore, to reduce the size of the preservation district in order to speed up permit approval in areas that no longer retain a historic character while still being able to provide tax credits and tax abatements incentives to owners who desire to restore isolated historic structures, the Olde Towne preservation commission is hereby given the authority to act as the city landmark commission to: 
(1)  Designate a site, location, structure or monument as a historic landmark. 
(2)  Maintain a landmark list. 
(3)  Ensure the State historical preservation officer has a current list of all city designated landmarks.

"1.  The geographic limits of the proposed landmark described in a manner sufficient to locate the site upon the ground. 
2.  A statement to clarify that landowner consent for a site to become a landmark does not constitute a forfeiture of all control over the land upon which the site is located. 
3.  A statement to acknowledge that landowner consent for a site to become a landmark does represent a pledge on the part of the landowner or landowners to preserve and protect the site as a nonrenewable cultural resource. 
4.  A statement specifying the precise degree of jurisdiction transferred to the commission with respect to determining who shall be allowed to enter upon the landmark for the purpose of removing artifacts and specimens of all types or for the purpose of violating the site by any form of excavation for whatever reason. 
5.  A statement containing language encouraging the landowner to remove the landmark from cultivation or stipulating those plaza or village areas that may be subjected to continued normal cultivation under the agreement. 
6.  A statement of recognition that all contractors authorized by the commission must respect the rights of the landowner and will be held liable for damage to all access routes, property, and lands adjacent to the landmark. 
7.  A statement stipulating who shall retain title to all artifacts and other physical remains recovered from the landmark under the provisions of a contract for survey and salvage. 
8.  A statement setting out the exact limits and degree of public access to the landmark, if any, that are acceptable to the landowner and to the commission once the landmark has been investigated, properly restored, and stabilized. 
9.  A statement containing any special conditions and restrictions which will be described fully in a manner acceptable to both the commission and the landowner or landowners." 
    If any provision of this division shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions herein which can be given effect without the invalid provision and to this end the provisions of the division are hereby declared to be severable. 
(Ord. No. 3840, 11-15-2016)

(p)  Provisions of ordinance in case of conflict . In the event of conflicting ordinances, non-preservation ordinances prevail except as otherwise approved by the city council. 
(q)  New construction. Proposals for new construction in the Olde Towne Preservation District should seek compatibility with existing structures through the appropriate use of site planning, materials, decorative details, architectural elements, and scale. Architectural context is the primary concern, and a proposal does not have to replicate or copy any specific historic style or period. The following factors will be considered. 
(1)  Scale: Scale is the relationship of the building and its elements (including doors and windows) to other structures in the district. It is important when considering scale, that a careful study be made of the height, width, and mass of buildings in the immediate neighborhood and district as a whole. This study should serve to confirm or deny the appropriateness of the height, width, and mass of the proposed building. Maximum height of any new structure shall conform to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring & Reconstructing Historic Buildings. In no case shall a new structure exceed a height allowed in the zoning district in which the building is located. 
(2)  Siting: Siting is the positioning of a building on a lot. This process includes determining the setback of a building, the spacing of this building from adjacent buildings, and the location of walls, fences, walks, drives, parking and landscaping if any of these are used in the overall design. New construction should conform to setback, landscape, and parking requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. Modifications to existing structures and sites can retain their historic setbacks and other siting considerations, as long as they do not conflict with life safety requirements in the International building, residential, and fire codes. 
(3)  Materials: With the exception of vinyl siding, materials identified in the city's design guidelines for Olde Towne District structures are permitted in the Olde Towne Preservation District. Other materials not specifically mentioned in these design guidelines will be considered on a case by case basis and approved by the commission. 
(4)  Decorative details: Decorative details include ornamentation or embellishment. Ornamentation and embellishment include cornices, lintels, arches, balustrades, chimneys, shutters, columns, and other common details. When used, details should create a unifying effect on a building and should be compatible with the context of the neighborhood. 
(5)  Architectural elements: Architectural elements includes parts of a building that are integral to its composition. These include balconies, roofs, porches, chimneys, dormers, parapets, and other parts of a building that contribute to its overall shape and silhouette. The choice and arrangement of elements of a proposed building should reflect those of other buildings in the neighborhood. The building should not draw unnecessary attention to itself by failing to relate to neighboring styles. Neither should it copy these styles. The object is to compliment the context of the Olde Towne Preservation District. 
(r)  Treatment of a historic resource. The U.S. Secretary of Interior has established standards for the treatment of historic properties. Treatments are divided into four categories of preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction. [10] The commission shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the treatment of historic properties guidelines for preserving, rehabilitating, restoring and reconstructing historic buildings in considering all proposals for preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction. 
(1)  Standards for preservation. 
a.  A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that maximizes the retention of distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. Where a treatment and use have not been identified, a property will be protected, and if necessary, stabilized until additional work may be undertaken. 
b.  The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The replacement of intact or repairable historic materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided. 
c.  Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate, and conserve existing historic materials and features will be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection, and properly documented for future research. 
d.  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved. 
f.  The existing condition of historic features will be evaluated to determine the appropriate level of intervention needed. Where the severity of deterioration requires repair or limited replacement of a distinctive feature, the new material will match the old in composition, design, color, and texture. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, when determined appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
8.  Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
(2)  Standards for rehabilitation. 
a.  A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding contextual features or elements from other historic properties, shall not be undertaken. 
d.  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
h.  Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
i.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
j.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(3)  Standards for restoration. 
a.  A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use which reflects the property's restoration period. 
b.  Materials and features from the restoration period shall be retained and preserved. The removal of materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize the period shall not be undertaken. 
c.  Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate and conserve materials and features from the restoration period shall be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection, and properly documented for future research. 
d.  Materials, features, spaces, and finishes that characterize other historical periods shall be documented prior to their alteration or removal. 
e.  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize the restoration period shall be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated features from the restoration period shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. 
g.  Replacement of missing features from the restoration period shall be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. A false sense of history shall not be created by adding contextual features, features from other properties, or by combining features that never existed together historically. 
h.  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
i.  Archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
j.  Designs that were never executed historically shall not be constructed. 
(4)  Standards for reconstruction. 
a.  Reconstruction shall be used to depict vanished or non-surviving portions of a property when documentary and physical evidence is available to permit accurate reconstruction with minimal conjecture and such reconstruction is essential to the public understanding of the property. 
b.  Reconstruction of a landscape, building, structure, or object in its historic location shall be preceded by a thorough archeological investigation to identify and evaluate those features and artifacts which are essential to an accurate reconstruction. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
c.  Reconstruction shall include measures to preserve any remaining historic materials, features, and spatial relationships. 
d.  Reconstruction shall be based on the accurate duplication of historic features and elements substantiated by documentary or physical evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different features from other historic properties. A reconstructed property shall recreate the appearance of the non-surviving historic property in materials, design, color, and texture. 
e.  A reconstruction shall be clearly identified as a contemporary re-creation. 
f.  Designs that were never executed historically shall not be constructed. When a contemporary depiction is required to understand and interpret a property's historic value (including the recreation of missing components in a historic district or site); when no other property with the same associative value has survived; and when sufficient historical documentation exists to ensure an accurate reproduction, reconstruction may be considered as a treatment. 
(s)  Fences . Fence design must be in harmony with the nature of the district and in compliance with Appendix A: Zoning, Section 2.22 Supplementary District Regulations to the City of Slidell's Code of Ordinances. The following fencing materials are not acceptable: barbed wire; chain-link, except in the side and rear yard; concrete block unless clad in stucco or another approved material; stockade; plywood; Hardi board; or asbestos board. 
(t)  Overhanging balconies, canopies or awnings. No overhanging balconies, canopies or awnings may be removed, modified, or constructed without the approval of the commission. New or additional balconies, canopies, or awnings must conform to the distinctive architecture of the Olde Towne Preservation District. The permit for all such new construction or any renovation shall be subject to the requirements of this division. 
(1)  Encroachment into public right-of-way. In the C3: Central Business District, if an existing balcony, canopy, or awning is to be extended or substantially improved or a new balcony, canopy, or awning is to be added that would encroach into the public right-of-way then the owner must first get permission from the city in the form of an encroachment agreement. 
(2)  Encroachment into the setback. In any district other than C3: Central Business District, if an existing balcony, canopy, or awning is to be extended or substantially improved or a new balcony added that would encroach into either the front, rear, or side yard setback area a variance would first need to be obtained from the city's board of zoning adjustments.

Demolition can be either at the request of the property owner or an action by the city to remove a deteriorated structure that poses a threat to health and safety. 
(1)  Demolition by request of the owner . When a property owner applies for a permit to demolish an historic structure the application will be referred to the preservation commission for review at the next scheduled meeting of the commission. Before a permit can be issued, the preservation commission must review the application to determine if loss of this structure will adversely impact the city's Certified Local Government or National Register designation.

On failure of the owner or occupant to comply with such notice, the inspector shall have the authority to give written notice to the utility company to cut off or disconnect utility services, or otherwise cause the operation to be discontinued, until the defects are corrected. 
(o)  Certificate of approval. If such installation, alteration, extension or connection shall be found to be fully in compliance with the provisions of this code, and all electrically controlled appliances have been inspected and approved, the city shall issue to such person a certificate of inspection and approval. This certificate shall be taken as evidence that the work has been done and completed in accordance with the provisions of this code. 
(p)  Revocation of license. Any licenses granted under this code may be revoked by the city council if the holder of the license violates any ordinance or law relating to the rules and regulations or is guilty of any act or in any installation work which is dangerous to life or property, or for transferring or allowing directly or indirectly persons, firms or corporations other than the lawful holder to operate or to obtain permits to do work under such license, provided the holder of the license be found guilty of such violations by the board.

The designated city authority shall review all necessary plans for all city projects that involve any protected public or private tree(s), and ensure that the plans are implemented according to the tree protection standards below. 
b.  Tree removal policy for city construction projects: The city shall attempt to design construction projects that will avoid damage or require the removal of trees, especially hardwood trees, larger than four inches DBH (diameter breast height). The engineering and planning departments shall decide if the construction activity will cause severe damage to the trees and determine the need for their removal. If the tree is removed from the city's right-of-way, easement, or servitude, an appropriate species of tree shall be replaced if space is available. The city shall not pay monetary compensation for the loss of trees. 
c.  Maintenance of city infrastructure: The designated city authority responsible for actions to maintain city infrastructure must adhere to tree protection standards below. 
(2)  Standards for critical root zone (CRZ), trunk, and branch protection. Where applicable, the designated city authority shall inspect, approve, and enforce or implement the standards listed below, and may prevent the building safety department from issuing a building permit or certificate of occupancy for the building, or prevent the engineering department from issuing a development permit, if a required standard has not been implemented. After the standard is implemented, the designated city authority must approve the release of the permit or certificate of occupancy. 
a.  Fencing: Protected trees and stands of trees proposed for retention shall have orange construction fencing installed under the CRZ (at a minimum) prior to any and during all public land development and building construction activities. The fence may be removed after obtaining most of the building inspections and just before finishing the landscaping (e.g., in order to mulch and fertilize under the drip line of the tree(s). 
b.  No compaction from any heavy equipment, as defined by Louisiana Commercial Drivers License regulations, shall occur in the drip line. If heavy equipment must operate within the drip line, the designated city authority must approve such activity, and the root protection techniques contained in the architectural standards manual must be implemented. Brush clearing shall be done by hand or by hand-held machines within the drip line. 
c.  Whenever sidewalks or streets have to be pulled-up within the drip line of a tree, great care must be taken to slowly and easily break up and pull up pieces of the surface so as to prevent or significantly minimize the tearing of roots. 
d.  Drastic changes in drainage patterns that may significantly harm existing trees shall be avoided or negated. This includes raising sidewalks or streets as to create the pooling of water under the drip line of the tree. Where necessary, new drain lines shall be installed. 
e.  No more than one inch of fill is permitted under the drip line (no fill is preferred). If fill is necessary, it must be added and spread out by hand (no heavy equipment is allowed). If necessary, and if the health of the tree is good, one inch of fill per year may be hand-added thereafter. 
f.  Grates or other pervious surfaces shall be utilized within the CRZ. In situations where impervious surfaces within the CRZ are not practical, feasible, or limited, tree feeders may be installed as a last resort, but no closer than eight feet away from the trunk. Tree feeders must be installed per the specifications of the manufacturer, and inspected by the designated city authority. 
g.  No grading below the existing ground elevation or soil replacement shall occur within the drip line (even if tree feeders in concrete are used). If a curb is constructed around the drip line or if more than two inches of fill will be necessary immediately outside of the drip line, a tree well must be constructed. The designated city authority must approve the well design prior to construction, and must inspect the well during construction (for proper material amounts and placement) and after construction (for proper function-e.g., during or shortly after a heavy rain). 
h.  There shall be no deposit or placement of any materials under the drip line that may impede the free passage of water, air, or fertilizer to the roots, except by written approval of the designated city authority. 
i.  If it is absolutely necessary to prune roots within the drip line of the tree, no more than one-third of the feeder root system can be affected. The tree species, health, and physical surroundings must be evaluated as well. If no employee with the designated city authority possesses the proper training or knowledge to determine the tree and root harm, the pruning decision must be made the city volunteer arborist, or an arborist hired by the city. Roots over two and one-half inches thick must be pruned using the following techniques (in order): dig a small hole around the root prune area, smoothly cut the root with the least amount of vibration to the tree, pour rubbing alcohol or a fungal treatment on the root cut, fill the hole with sand or gravel, and if concrete is poured over the root, a piece of two mil thickness visqueen shall be laid over it. 
j.  If roots are greater than four inches in width, tunneling of underground utilities is required. If the tree is 15 to 19 inches in diameter, the minimum distance from the trunk to start tunneling is 12 feet, and if the tree is more than 19 inches in diameter, the minimum distance is 15 feet. If tunneling cannot occur at these minimum distances, then root pruning following the directions in subsection i. above shall be implemented. 
k.  In situations where a sidewalk or road must be built or replaced and root pruning will harm more than a one-third of the entire root system, an alternate form of construction must be used as described in "Reducing Infrastructure Damage by Tree Roots" by L. R. Costello and K. S. Jones and approved by public works, engineering, and the designated city authority (planning or recreation). 
l.  The spraying or pouring of any oils, whitewash, gaseous liquids, or any other harmful chemical on any part of the tree or within the drip line shall be prohibited. 
m.  The spraying or pouring of any other necessary chemicals (e.g., fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, or insecticide) on protected public trees shall only be done by the city, or with the written permission of the designated city authority. 
n.  The placement of any nail, screw, wire, lights, rope, sign, poster, barricade, or other fixture on protected public trees shall only be done by the city, or with the written permission of the designated city authority, but not as to detrimentally harm the tree. 
o.  In the event that a root greater than two and one-half inches thick is cut by accident, the root pruning technique mentioned in subsection i. above must be implemented. 
p.  In the event that a branch greater that two and one-half inches thick is broken by accident, it must be repaired by proper pruning. If the branch is on a protected public tree, only city employees may prune it. If the city accidentally breaks the branch of a protected private tree, and the pruning area is on private property, the city must get written permission from the owner prior to pruning. 
q.  In the event that the trunk is damaged by accident, it shall be left alone to heal on its own-no tars or other substances shall be painted on the trunk. 
r.  Any person who intentionally damages a tree as mentioned in this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction be punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00 that is determined by the damage to the tree and based on the species, age, and location. 
(3)  Tree replacement. Should any required tree die or be removed; the tree should be replaced by a similar tree meeting the requirements of this article. Replacement trees shall be required to be installed within 20 days of written notice designated city authority.

Sec. 13-109. - Tree and stump removal. 
(a)  Tree removal. The city may remove any public tree, except those on state streets/highways right-of-way that the city is not responsible for, for the following reasons: 
(1)  Necessity to remove trees which pose a safety hazard to buildings, pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or threaten to cause disruption of public services. 
(2)  Necessity to remove trees weakened by disease or insects, age, storm, fire, or other injury. 
(3)  Necessity to remove trees that have major anchoring roots that are cracking or very close to cracking the slab of a building, are significantly hampering proper drainage patterns that cannot be rectified by other techniques (e.g., installing pipes under a root), or are causing or very close to causing damage to underground sewer, water, or gas lines. 
(4)  Necessity to remove trees in order to construct city improvement projects or to properly maintain city property, or for the necessary access to such projects and property. Activities include, but are not limited to: access to a public building, parking lot, or service equipment (e.g., sewer lift stations); and essential grade changes or surface water drainage improvements. Locations of proposed city improvement projects should be based on section 13-108(1)a, but not so as to cause unreasonable economic hardship. 
(5)  Necessity to remove trees to observe good tree maintenance practices that will strengthen and protect existing desirable and protected public trees. 
(b)  Stump removal. All stumps within public property or city-maintained state highways, when in or near the path of vehicular, bike, or foot traffic, shall be removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the ground. Exceptions may be made if removing the stump will cause significant damage to a protected public tree as defined in this ordinance, and there is no trip/fall hazard or the trip/fall hazard is mitigated by some other means such as bollards, fencing, or alternative routes. The removal of stumps is determined by the designated city authority. 
(c)  Removal records. The day after this ordinance is adopted, the designated city authority shall start and maintain electronic records of all trees that are removed within the city limits. Records shall include the following minimum information: Species, location, name of person that removed the tree, date tree was removed.

(Ord. No. 3253, 13-50, 2-22-2005) 
Sec. 13-111. - Requirements and procedures regarding city contracts. 
    Per state law, if trees are within 100 feet of developed property, they must be removed by a state-licensed and insured arborist. If trees are not within 100 feet within developed property, contracted persons may bulldoze trees. These persons must be insured, and city or state licensed contractors or subcontractors. 
(Ord. No. 3253, 13-51, 2-22-2005) 
Sec. 13-112. - Review by city planning and zoning commission. 
    The city planning and zoning commission shall have the right to review the conduct, acts, and decisions of the tree board. Any person may appeal any ruling or order of the city tree board to the city board of zoning adjustment, who may hear the matter and make final decisions. 
(Ord. No. 3253, 13-52, 2-22-2005) 
Sec. 13-113. - Penalty.

Sec. 14-41. - Penalty for false alarms. 
(a)  Sending of false alarms . The sending of an alarm signal eliciting a response by a fire district when a situation requiring a response by a fire district does not in fact exist, including, but not limited to, the activation or transmission of any alarm signal caused by human error, mechanical or electronic malfunction, negligence of the alarm system user or alarm system user's agent or employee, intentional false activation by a user or the tenant or employee of a user or any other activation or transmission of any alarm signal where no emergency exists, whether the exact cause of the alarm activation is determined, is prohibited. Severe weather, power outages, transmission line malfunctions, acts of God, acts of terrorism or any other cause clearly beyond the control of the alarm system user may be considered in determining if an alarm activation was false and whether any occurrence, fine, warning or other action will be taken against the alarm system user as provided for by this section. 
(b)  Unlawful activation of a panic alarm . No person shall activate any panic alarm for the purpose of summoning a fire district except in the event of an unauthorized entry, robbery or other crime being committed or attempted on the premises or in the event the person needs immediate assistance in order to avoid injury, property loss or bodily harm. The unnecessary dispatching of a fire district for panic alarms will be counted against the alarm site as a false alarm. 
(c)  Grace period . Beginning with the date of alarm activation or alarm conversion/takeover, there shall be a thirty-day grace period. During the thirty-day grace period, false alarms will not be counted as an occurrence toward the total for the calendar year, nor will the alarm system user be subject to any fine, warning or other action as provided for in this section. 
(d)  Penalties for sending of false alarms . The sending of a false alarm constitutes a violation of this section. It shall be the responsibility of the alarm system user to provide the necessary documentation in order to verify the alarm system's date of purchase, conversion/takeover date, or installation to authenticate the grace period and administrative warnings, fines and/or suspension of a fire district response may be assessed/imposed upon an alarm system user by the alarm administrator for excessive false alarms during a calendar year as follows: 
Number of False Alarms Penalty 1 to 3 No fine assessed. Alarm user identification letter issued for 2nd and 3rd false alarm. 4 to 5 $250.00 fine per false alarm to alarm system user. 6 and above $500.00 fine per false alarm to alarm system user.  
    All funds derived from the fines contained in this article, except those fines imposed and collected by the city court, shall be allocated to the operating budget of the responding fire district which issued the fine. Except for the fines collected by the city court, it shall be the responsibility of the fire district or a designated collection agency or agencies to collect such fines. Offenders shall be liable to the responding fire district for all costs incurred in collecting any unpaid fines, including court costs and attorney fees. 
(e)  Training waiver . Once per calendar year, an alarm system user shall have a false alarm fine waived upon payment of all prior fines imposed through this section and submission of written documentation of the alarm system user having attended training recognized by the alarm industry to reduce false alarms. 
(f)  False alarm annual count . False alarm annual counts are calculated on a calendar year basis, beginning on January 1 of each year. At the end of the year described above, the false alarm count will revert to zero, provided all charges, fees, and fines have been paid. Multiple alarms from the same site on a single calendar day may be counted as only one false alarm for the purposes of penalty assessment. 
(g)  Alarm user identification letter . Upon receipt of the second and third false alarm report, the alarm administrator shall send an alarm user identification letter by certified mail and/or hand delivery to both the owner and occupant of the alarm site. The alarm system user shall be accountable for accurately completing the requested identification information and returning same to the fire district alarm administrator. The letter shall include: 
(1)  The name, birth date, driver's license number, address and telephone numbers of the person who is the alarm system user and who is responsible for the proper maintenance and operation of the alarm system. In the case of a firm, corporation, partnership, association, company or organization, an individual shall be designated and identified as the corporate officer, partner, associate or company representative who will be held accountable as the responsible person for the alarm site. 
(2)  The classification of the alarm site as either residential, commercial or apartment. 
(3)  The name, address and phone number of the alarm business performing the alarm system installation, activation, conversion/takeover and business responsible for providing repair service to the alarm system. 
(4)  The name, address and phone number of the alarm system monitoring company, if different from the installing alarm business, and if applicable. 
(h)  Warning notification letter . The alarm administrator shall send a "notification of false alarm and fine" by certified mail and/or hand delivery to notify the alarm system user and the alarm business and/or alarm system monitoring company of each false alarm when a fine is applicable, and the consequences of the failure to pay the fine. The alarm administrator shall also inform alarm system users of their right to appeal the finding of any false alarm to the fire district via the alarm administrator or his designee. 
(i)  Failure to pay fine . If an assessed fine has not been paid within 30 days of the day the notice of fine was mailed or delivered by the alarm administrator and there is no appeal pending on the finding of the false alarm, the alarm administrator shall send a second notice of false alarm and fine by certified mail, return receipt requested, along with a notice of late fee of $25.00. If payment is not received within ten days of the day such notice was received, the fire district may take actions to collect the fine, including bringing a claim in the appropriate small claims court or using the services of a collections agency. 
(j)  Appeal through the alarm appeals board. 
(1)  Composition of the board . An alarm appeals board shall be convened to address unresolved disputes pertaining to the findings of false alarms by an alarm administrator, fines, or any other issue of a common interest to the fire district, alarm industry and/or alarm system users. The alarm appeals board shall be comprised of five members: one fire district representative designated by the fire district, one alarm industry representative from St. Tammany Parish designated by the local chapter of the state safety and fire alarm association, and three alarm system users from the City of Slidell to be appointed by the city council. The terms of the board members shall be one year, running from January 1 to December 31. Board members may succeed themselves. No member of this board shall be liable for any civil action for any act performed in good faith in the execution of his duties as a board member. The alarm industry, including alarm businesses and alarm system monitoring companies, shall not be responsible for the collection of any fines levied against alarm system users for violating the requirements of this article. 
(2)  Appeal from fines . The alarm appeals board shall conduct a hearing in those matters requested for appeal that have been ruled on by the alarm administrator. The request must be in writing and must be made within 15 days of the alarm system user having received the notification of false alarm. Failure to appeal the determination in the required time period results in a conclusive presumption of the validity of the alarm administrator's determination. If a hearing is requested, written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be served on the alarm system user by the alarm administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested, which date shall not be more than 21 nor less than ten days after the filing of the request for hearing. The board shall make its decision on the basis of a preponderance of evidence presented at the hearing, including but not limited to, evidence that the false alarm dispatch was caused by a defective part that has been repaired or replaced or that an alarm dispatch was caused by a criminal offense. The board must render a decision within 30 days after the request for an appeal is filed. If decision is not rendered within 30 days, the alarm administrator's ruling stands. The board shall affirm, reverse, or modify the action of the alarm administrator. The decision of the board is final as to administrative remedies with the parish. The proceedings of the alarm appeals board shall be audio recorded. 
(3)  City court proceedings . The decision of the alarm appeals board shall have no standing with respect to the adjudication of proceedings within the city court relative to false alarms.

Secs. 15-1-15-20. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - FLOOD HAZARD PREVENTION 

Sec. 15-21. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1966, § 7-21) 
Sec. 15-22. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and minimize public harm and private losses in special flood hazard areas with provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control, in the sense of providing authoritative guidance, the alteration of natural floodplains, their protective barriers and stream channels; 
(4)  Prevent the construction of barriers which will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards; 
(5)  Control, in the sense of providing authoritative guidance, development which would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage, such as grading, dredging and excavation. 
(Code 1966, § 7-22) 
Sec. 15-23. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life and property exposed to the hazards of flooding; 
(2)  Ensure that potential property owners are notified if property is a special flood hazard area; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas; 
(6)  Minimize expenditure of future public money for costly flood control projects.

    Special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed rate-making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of execution; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavations for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

(i)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances are as follows: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  Neither the city, nor any of its officials, either elected or appointed, shall be held liable for any damages sustained as a result of the granting of or denial of a variance to this article. 
(k)  When the ownership of any property on which a variance has been granted is proposed to be transferred, the prospective owner shall be notified in writing by the present owner of the property of the variance granted and any use thereof. The variance must be made part of the public records by the planning and zoning commissions.

If the fill is to be placed in an X, B, or C zone, no additional fill shall be allowed. At no time shall a fully enclosed retaining wall system be built by first bringing an excessive amount of fill to the property, followed by construction of the retaining wall, then removal of excess fill. No excess fill shall be brought to the property than will ultimately remain on the property. Construction of fully enclosed retaining wall systems shall begin with construction of al least three sides of the retaining wall. Fill may then brought into the retaining wall and compacted. 
(5)  Bulkhead construction. Bulkheads and other structure projecting into a waterway shall be constructed no farther into a lake, river, canal, bayou, or stream than the ordinary average watermark or established property line, as approved by applicable local, state, and federal agencies. Bulkheads shall be designed so as not to impede positive drainage of the site and adjoining properties. 
(6)  To control erosion into drainageways, minimize required public maintenance of essential drainage and roadways systems, and reduce surface water pollution, sediment retention barriers (silt fences) that comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's best management practices for the elimination of sediment runoff shall be required wherever necessary. 
(c)  Waivers. The mayor or his designee, the chief of staff, the city engineer, the city planning director, and the building official must jointly approve requests for waivers from the requirements stated in this section in writing.

(3)  After thorough investigation by the city attorney, it appears that the official, officer or employee was not acting in the discharge of his duties and within the scope of his office, employment, contract or assignment at the time of the alleged act or omission; or that he was acting in an intentionally wrongful manner; or was grossly negligent; provided, however, that the city shall not be obligated to indemnify the official, officer or employee for attorney fees incurred, unless the city attorney had determined not to assume the defense of the officer or employee based on his investigation, and the court subsequently finds that the official, officer or employee was acting in the discharge of his duties and within the scope of his employment, contract or assignment, and the damages did not result from the intentional wrongful act or gross negligence of the officer or employee.

(d)  Decision not to defend by city attorney. In any case where the city attorney does not undertake the representation of the official, officer or employee, the city attorney may take such action as he deems necessary including enrolling as co-counsel, to protect the interests of the city. The decision of the city attorney not to defend an official, officer or employee and any and all information obtained by him as a result of the investigations conducted pursuant to subsection (c)(3) or (c)(4) shall be considered confidential and shall not be admissible as evidence in any legal proceeding and no reference thereto shall be made in any trial or hearing. 
(e)  Liability for monetary damages. If an official, officer or employee of the city is held liable for monetary damages for actions arising under the circumstances provided by this section, the city shall appropriate a sum sufficient to reimburse the official, officer or employee. The court, upon request of any party, shall give written findings of fact as to whether the official, officer or employee was acting in the discharge of his duties and within the scope of his employment, and whether the damages were the result of the intentional wrongful act or gross negligence of the official, officer or employee. An out-of-court settlement shall have the effect of a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction for purposes of this section, but the settlement shall be approved by the city attorney. 
(f)  Private counsel. Nothing in this section shall in any way impair, limit or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of insurance or impair the right of the individual to obtain private counsel in his own behalf. However, the city shall not be obligated to indemnify the individual for the attorney fees so incurred, except as provided in subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
(g)  Compromise settlement. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from entering into a compromise settlement or agreement with the claimant prior to any judgment.

Such certificate shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the collector upon the dealer's ceasing to do business therein named. 
(h)  A manufacturer, wholesaler dealer, jobber or supplier shall refuse to accept a certificate that any property upon which a tax is imposed by the ordinance is purchased for resale, and shall collect the tax imposed by this division, unless the purchaser shall have a registration certificate to collect the tax imposed by this division; provided, however, that the payment of the tax by such purchaser shall not relieve the purchaser of the duty imposed in this section upon such purchaser to collect the tax upon any resale made by him. 
(i)  The tax imposed by this division upon the sale or use of any motor vehicle, subject to the Vehicle Registration License Tax Law (R.S. 47:451 et seq.) shall be collected by the Vehicle Commission and distributed to the district as provided for in R.S. 47:301(10)(f) and (18)(b). 
(j)  It is not the intention of this division to grant an exemption from the sales and use tax levied in this division to any sale, use, items, or transaction which has heretofore been taxable, and this division is not to be construed as so doing. It is the intent of this division to transfer the collection of the sales and use tax on vehicles from the vendor to the vehicle commissioner as agent for the district and to provide a method of collection of the tax directly from the vendee or user by the vehicle commissioner as agent of the collector. 
(k)  The provisions contained elsewhere in this division which exclude isolated or occasional sales from the definition of a sale at retail are not to apply to the sale of vehicles which are the subject to this division. Isolated or occasional sale of vehicles are hereby defined to be sales at retail and as such are subject to the tax. 
(l)  Where the purchaser has failed to pay and a dealer has failed to collect a tax upon a sale, as imposed by this division, then in addition to all other rights, obligations and remedies provided, such tax shall be payable by the purchaser directly to the governing body, and it shall be the duty of this purchaser to file a return thereof with the collector and to pay the tax imposed thereon to the governing body within 15 days after such sale was made or rendered. 
(m)  For the purpose of compensating the dealer in accounting for and remitting the tax levied by this division, each dealer shall be allowed 1 1/10 or 1.1 percent of the amount of tax due and accounted for remitted to the collector in the form of a deduction in submitting his report and paying the amount due by him. If the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment. 
(Code 1966, § 17-37) 
Sec. 26-70. - Collection of tax from dealers. 
(a)  The tax imposed by this division shall be collected by the collector on behalf of the district from all persons engaged in business. 
(1)  The collector is duly authorized and empowered to carry into effect the provisions of this division, and in pursuance thereof to make and enforce such rules as he may deem necessary. Such regulations when promulgated shall have the full force and effect of law. Promulgation shall be accomplished by publication at least one time in the official journal of the parish. 
(2)  The collector may employ such personnel, including legal counsel on a fee or salary basis, as are necessary to assist in the collection of the taxes imposed under this division. 
(3)  Any duly authorized representative or deputy of the collector, when acting under his authority and direction, shall have the same power as is conferred upon the collector by this division. 
(4)  The collector may conduct hearings and administer oaths, and examine under oath, any dealer and the directors, officers, agents and employees of any dealer, and any other witness relative to the business of such dealer in respect to any matter incident to the administration of this division. 
(b)  On all tangible personal property imported, or caused to be imported, from other states of other political subdivisions of this state, or any foreign country, and used by him, the dealer shall pay the tax imposed by this division on all articles of tangible personal property so imported and used, the same as if such article had been sold at retail for use or consumption, in the district. For the purpose of this division, use or consumption, or distribution or storage to be used or consumed in the district of tangible personal property, shall be equivalent to a sale at retail, and the tax shall thereupon immediately be levied and be collected in the manner provided in this section, provided that there shall be no duplication of the tax in any event. 
(c)  A credit against the use tax imposed by this division shall be granted to taxpayers who have paid a similar tax upon the sale or use of the same tangible personal property in another city or parish in the state, or city or county in a state other than the State of Louisiana. The credit provided in this subsection shall be granted only in the case where the city or parish in the state, or the city or county in a state other than the State of Louisiana to which a similar tax has been paid grants a similar credit as provided in this subsection. The proof of payment of the similar tax to another city or parish in the state, or to a city or county in a state other than the State of Louisiana shall be made according to rules and regulations promulgated by the collector. In no event shall the credit be greater than the tax imposed by this district upon the tangible personal property which is the subject of the use tax imposed by this division. 
(Code 1966, § 17-38) 
Sec. 26-71. - Returns and payment of tax. 
(a)  The tax levied under this division shall be due and payable by all dealers monthly on the first day of the month. 
(b)  For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of tax payable under this division, it shall be the duty of all dealers on or before the 20th day of each month to transmit to the collector, upon forms prescribed, prepared and furnished by him, returns showing the gross sales, purchases, gross proceeds from lease or rental, gross payments for lease or rental, gross proceeds derived from sales of services, or gross payment for services, as the case may be, arising from all taxable transactions during the preceding calendar month. Such returns shall show such further information as the collector may require to enable him to correctly compute and collect the tax levied in this section. Such returns shall be signed by the dealer filing the returns, and his signature thereon shall constitute a warranty on the part of the dealer that he has read and examined the returns and that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the returns are true, correct and complete. Every dealer at the time of making the return required under this division shall compute and remit to the district the required tax due for the preceding calendar month. 
(c)  At the time of transmitting the return required under this division to the collector, the dealer shall remit to the collector, the amount of the tax due under the applicable provisions of this division, and failure to so remit such tax shall cause such tax to become delinquent. All taxes, interest and penalties imposed under this division shall be paid to the collector in the form of remittance required by the collector. 
(d)  Gross proceeds from rentals or leases of tangible personal property where the lease or rental is part of a regularly established business, or the same is incidental or germane thereto, shall be reported, and the tax shall be paid with respect thereto, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the collector may prescribe. 
(e)  The collector, for good cause, may extend for not to exceed 30 days the time for making any returns required under the provisions of this division. 
(f)  For the purpose of collecting and remitting to the collector the tax imposed by this division, the dealer is hereby declared to be agent of this district. The sums of money collected by the dealer for payment of sales and use taxes shall be and remain the property of the taxing authority. 
(Code 1966, § 17-39) 
Sec. 26-72. - Records; inspection. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of every dealer to make a report and pay any tax under this division, to keep and preserve suitable records of the sales or purchases or sales of services, as the case may be, taxable under this division and such other books of account as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax due under this division, and other information as may be required by the collector, and it shall be the duty of every such dealer, moreover, to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all invoices and other records of goods, wares and merchandise or other subjects of taxation under this division. All such books, invoices and other records shall be open to examination at all reasonable hours, by the collector or any of his duly authorized agents. 
(b)  Each dealer shall secure, maintain and keep, for a period of three years, a complete record of sales and service and tangible personal property received, used, sold at retail, distributed or stored, leased or rented within this district by such dealer, together with invoices, bills of lading, and other pertinent records and papers as may be required by the collector for the reasonable administration of this division. All such records shall be open for inspection to the collector at all reasonable hours. 
(c)  In order to aid in the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this division and to collect all of the tax imposed by this division, all wholesale dealers and jobbers in this district are hereby required to keep a record of all sales of tangible personal property made in this district, whether such sales be for cash or on terms of credit. The record required to be kept by all wholesale dealers and jobbers shall contain and include the name and address of the purchaser, the date of the purchase, the article purchased and the price at which the article is sold to the purchaser. These records shall be open to inspection of the collector or his duly authorized assistants or deputies at all reasonable hours. 
(d)  For the purpose of administering this division, the collector, whenever he deems it expedient, may make or cause to be made an examination or investigation of the place of business, if any; the tangible personal property; and the books, records, papers, vouchers, accounts and documents of any dealer. It shall be the duty of every dealer and every director, official, agent or employee of every dealer to exhibit to the collector the tangible personal property; and all of the books, records, papers, vouchers, accounts and documents of the dealer; and to facilitate any such examination or investigation as far as it may be in his or their power so to do. 
(e)  For the purpose of enforcing the collection of the tax levied by this division, the collector is hereby specifically authorized and empowered to examine, at all reasonable hours the books, records, and other documents of all transportation companies, agencies or firms operating in this district whether such companies, agencies or firms conduct their business by truck, rail, water, airplane or otherwise, in order to determine what dealers, as provided in this division, are importing or are otherwise shipping divisions of tangible personal property which are liable for such tax. 
(f)  The collector shall keep a record of all of his official acts and shall preserve copies of all rules, decisions and orders made by him. Copies of such rules, decisions or orders and of any paper or papers filed in any office maintained by him in the administration of this division may be authenticated under his official signature and when so authenticated shall be evidence in all courts of the state of the same weight and force as the original. 
(g)  Except as otherwise provided by law, the records and files of general sales and use tax ordinance of this district are confidential and privileged, and no person shall divulge or disclose any information obtained from such records and files except in the administration and enforcement of the tax laws of this district, or of another political subdivision of this state. 
(h)  No person shall divulge or disclose any information obtained from any examination or inspection of the premises or property of any person in connection with administration and enforcement of the general sales and use tax laws of this district except to the collector. 
(i)  Neither the collector nor any employee engaged in the administration or charged with the custody of such records or files shall be required to produce any of them for inspection or use in any action or proceeding, except in an action of proceeding in the administration or enforcement of the tax laws of this state or of a political subdivision. 
(j)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prevent: 
(1)  The delivery to a taxpayer or his duly authorized representative of a copy of any return or report or any other paper filed by him pursuant to the provisions of this division. 
(2)  The publication of statistics so classified to prevent the identification of any return or report and the items thereof. 
(3)  The use of reports filed by a taxpayer under a state statute or an ordinance of a political subdivision, in an action against the same taxpayer for a tax due under another state statute, or another tax ordinance of a political subdivision. 
(4)  The inspection by the legal representative of the district of the returns, reports or files relating to the claim of any taxpayer who has bought an action to review or set aside any tax imposed under this division or against whom an action or proceeding has been instituted in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(5)  The furnishing, in the discretion of the collector, of any information disclosed by the records or files to any official person of this state or political subdivision of this state, or any other state, or of the United States who is concerned with the administration of taxes and who in fact furnishes or has agreed with the collector to furnish information contained in the records and files administrated by him to the district. On a reciprocal basis, however, no such exchange of information shall be made in contravention of any provision of R.S. 47:1501 et seq., prohibiting the dissemination of such information, nor shall such information be divulged except as provided by law. In addition, information divulged under this subsection shall only be given to an agency which has agreed in advance to respect the confidentiality of such information. 
(k)  Whoever violates any provisions of this section by divulging information shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 60 days or fined not more than $500.00, or both. 
(Code 1966, § 17-40) 
Sec. 26-73. - Imported goods; permits. 
    In order to prevent the illegal importation into the district of tangible personal property which is subject to the tax, and to strengthen and make more effective the manner and method of enforcing payment of the tax imposed by this division, the collector is hereby authorized and empowered to put into operation a system of permits whereby any person, or dealer, may import tangible personal property by truck, automobile, or other means of transportation other than a common carrier, without having the truck, automobile or other means of transportation seized and subjected to legal proceedings for its forfeiture. Such system of permits shall require the person, or dealer, who desires to import tangible personal property into the district, which property is subject to tax imposed by this division, to apply to the collector for a sales tax registration certificate. The dealer may make as many copies of the certificate as necessary in order to ensure that one copy is displayed in every vehicle of the dealer which operated or may operate within the boundaries of the district. 
(Code 1966, § 17-41) 
Sec. 26-74. - Collection remedies and procedures. 
(a)  For the purpose of the enforcement of this division, and the collection of the tax levied under this division, it is presumed that all tangible personal property, subject to the provisions of this division, imported into this district or held in this district by any dealer is to be sold at retail, used or consumed, or stored for use or consumption in this district, and is subject to the tax levied in this division; provided, however, that such presumption shall be prima facie only, and subject to proof furnished to the collector. 
(b)  Failure to pay any tax due, as provided in this division, shall, ipso facto, without demand or putting in default, cause such tax, interest, penalties and costs to become immediately delinquent, and the collector is hereby vested with authority, on motion in a court of competent jurisdiction, to take a rule on the dealer, to show cause in not less than two or more than ten days, exclusive of holidays, after the service thereof, which may be tried out of term and in chambers, and shall always be tried by preference, why such dealer should not be ordered to cease from further pursuit of business as a dealer, and in case such rule is made absolute, the order thereon rendered shall be considered a judgment in favor of the sheriff, prohibiting such dealer from the further pursuit of such business until such time as he has paid the delinquent tax, interest, penalties and costs. Every violation of the injunction shall be considered as a contempt of court, and punished according to law. 
(c)  If the amount of tax due by the dealer is not paid on or before the 20th day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due, there shall be collected, with such tax, interest upon such unpaid amount, at the rate of 18 percent per annum, or fractional part thereof, to be computed from the first day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due until it is paid. In addition to the interest that may be so due, there shall also be collected a penalty equivalent to five percent for each 30 days, or fraction thereof, of delinquency, not to exceed 25 percent in aggregate, of the tax due, when such tax is not paid within 30 days of the date the tax first becomes due and payable, and in the event of suit, attorneys' fees at the rate of 25 percent of the aggregate of tax, interest and penalty. 
(d)  If any dealer fails to make a report and pay the tax as provided by this division, or in case the dealer makes a grossly incorrect report, or a report that is false or fraudulent, it shall be the duty of the collector to make an estimate for the taxable period of the retail sales, or sales of services, of such dealer, or of the gross proceeds from rentals or leases of tangible personal property by the dealer, and an estimate of the cost price of all divisions of tangible personal property imported by the dealer for use or consumption or distribution or storage to be used or consumed in this district and assess and collect the tax and interest, plus penalty, if such have accrued, on the basis of such assessment, which shall be considered prima facie correct. The burden to show the contrary shall rest upon the dealer. If such estimate and assessment requires an examination of books, records or documents, or an audit thereof, then the collector shall add to the assessment the cost of such examination, together with all penalties accruing thereon. If any dealer fails to make any return required by this division or makes an incorrect return, and the circumstances indicate willful negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, but no intent to defraud, there shall be imposed in addition to any other penalties provided in this division, a specific penalty of five percent of the tax or deficiency found to be due, or $10.00, whichever is greater. This specific penalty shall be an obligation to be collected and accounted for in the same manner as if it were a part of the tax due and can be enforced either in a separate action or in the same action for the collection of the tax. 
(e)  If any dealer liable for any tax, interest or penalty under this division shall sell out his business or stock of goods or shall quit the business, he shall make a final return and payment within 15 days after the date of selling or quitting business. His successors or assigns, if any, shall withhold sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of such taxes, interest and penalties due and unpaid until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt from the collector showing that they have been paid, or a certificate stating that no taxes, interest or penalties are due. If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods shall fail to withhold purchase money as provided, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes, interest and penalties accrued and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by any former owners or assignors. In the case of a dealer who has quit business, and who subsequently opens another similar business under the same ownership, whether that ownership is individual, partnership, corporation or other, that dealer shall be liable for any tax, interest, penalty, cost or fee owed by the original business. 
(f)  If any dealer is delinquent in the payment of the tax provided for in this section, the collector may give notice of the amount of such delinquency by registered mail to all persons having in their possession, or under their control, any credits or other personal property belonging to such dealer, or owing any debts to such dealer at the time of receipt by them of such notice, and thereafter any person so notified shall neither transfer nor make any other disposition of such credits, other personal property, or debts until the collector shall have consented to a transfer or disposition, or until 30 days shall have elapsed from and after the receipt of such notice. All persons so notified must, within five days after receipt of such notice, advise the collector of any and all such credits, other personal property or debts, in their possession, under their control or owing by them, as the case may be. 
(g)  If the dealer has imported tangible personal property and he fails to produce an invoice showing the cost price of the divisions which are subject to tax, or the invoice does not reflect the true or actual cost price, then the collector shall ascertain, in any manner feasible, the true cost price and assess and collect the tax with interest, plus penalties, if such have accrued, on the true cost price as assessed by him. The assessment so made shall be considered prima facie correct, and the burden shall be on the dealer to show the contrary. 
(h)  In the case of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, if the consideration given or reported by the dealer does not, in the judgment of the collector, represent the true or actual consideration, then the collector is authorized to fix the same and collect the tax thereon for the sheriff in the same manner as provided in subsection (g) of this section, with interest, plus penalties, if such have accrued. 
(i)  If any transportation company, agency or firm shall refuse to permit examination of its books, records and other documents by the collector, the collector may proceed by rule, in term or in chambers, in any court of competent jurisdiction and require such transportation company, agency or firm to show cause why the collector should not be permitted to examine its books, records or other documents, and in case such rule be made absolute, the same shall be considered a judgment of the court and every violation of such judgment as a contempt thereof and punished according to law. 
(j)  If any dealer, subject to make and file a return required by any of the provisions of this division, fails to render such return within the time required, or renders a return which is false or fraudulent, in that it contains statements which differ from the true gross sales, purchases, leases or rentals, or other transactions, taxable under this division, or otherwise fails to comply with the provisions of this division, for the taxable period for which such return is made, the collector shall give such dealer 15 days' notice, in writing, requiring such dealer to appear before him or his assistant, with such books, records and papers as he may require, relating to the business of such dealer, for such taxable period. Such collector may require such dealer, or other agents or employees of such dealer, to give testimony or to answer interrogatories, under oath administered by the collector or his assistants, respecting the sale at retail, the use, or consumption, or distribution, or storage for use or consumption, in this district, or lease or rental of tangible personal property, or other transactions, subject to tax, or the failure to make report thereof, as provided in this division. 
(k)  If any dealer fails to make a return, or refuses to permit an examination of his, the dealer's, books, records or papers, or to appear and answer questions within the scope of such investigation relating to the sale, use, consumption, distribution, storage, lease or rental of tangible personal property, or sale of services, the collector may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction, for an order requiring such dealer to make such return or requiring the dealer, or his agents or employees, to appear and to answer any such questions or permit such examination. The court or any judge of the court shall thereupon issue an order, upon such reasonable notice as shall be prescribed therein, to be served upon such dealer or the agents or employees of such dealer, directing him or them to so appear and testify, and to produce such books, records, and papers as may be required. Any person, or any member of any firm, co-partnership, joint venture, association or corporation, or any agent or employee thereof, failing to comply with any such order shall be guilty of contempt, and shall be punished as provided by law in cases of contempt. 
(l)  The importation into this district of tangible personal property which is subject to tax, by truck, automobile or other means of transportation, other than a common carrier, without having first obtained a permit as described in section 26-73 (if the tax imposed by this division on such tangible personal property has not been paid), shall be construed as an attempt to evade payment of such tax, and the same is hereby prohibited, and the such truck, automobile, or means of transportation other than a common carrier, and such taxable property may be seized by the collector in order to secure the same as evidence in a trial, and the same shall be subject to forfeiture and sale in the manner provided for in this division. 
(m)  The failure of any dealer who imports tangible personal property from outside the district into the district for use or consumption or distribution or storage to be used or consumed in this district, or who imports for lease or rental any tangible personal property subject to the provisions of this division, shall ipso facto make the tax, interest, penalties and costs delinquent, and shall be construed as an attempt to avoid the payment of the same which shall be sufficient grounds for attachment of such tangible personal property wherever the same may be located or found, whether such delinquent dealer be a resident or nonresident of this parish, and whether such tangible personal property is in the possession of such delinquent dealer or in the possession of other persons, firms, corporations, or association of persons; provided, however, that it is the intention of this division to prevent the disposition of the such tangible personal property in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed by this division, together with interest, penalties and costs. Authority to attach is hereby specifically authorized and granted to the collector. In addition to the penalties prescribed in this subsection (m) and the preceding subsection (l), any person or dealer, who shall violate the provisions of such subsections, upon conviction, shall be fined in a sum of not more than $100.00 or imprisonment in jail for a period of not more than 60 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. Each importation or shipment by truck, automobile, or other means of transportation, other than a common carrier, found to be in violation of the provisions of these sections shall constitute a separate offense. 
(n)  The liability of any person or dealer arising from any tax, interest and penalty, or any of them, imposed by this division, from the time they are due, shall be a personal debt of such person or dealer to the collector, recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction in an action at law by the collector. Such debts, whether sued upon or not, shall be a lien on all the property of such delinquent person, or dealer, except as against an innocent purchaser for value without notice in the actual course of business, and shall have preference in any distribution of the assets of the person, or dealer, whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, or otherwise. The proceeds of any judgment or order obtained under this section shall be paid to the collector. 
(o)  The collector may require a bond or other security satisfactory to him for the payment of any taxes, fees, interest and penalties, or any of them, imposed pursuant to this division when he shall find that the collection thereof may be prejudiced without such security. 
(p)  If any person or dealer shall fail to make a return or report as required by this division, the collector, after the last day on which the omitted report could have been filed without penalty, may make an estimate of the amount of taxes such person or dealer is liable to pay under the terms of this division, from any information he is able to conveniently obtain, and according to such estimate so made by him, assess the taxes, fees, penalties and interest due the collector from such person or dealer give notice of such assessment to such person or dealer, and must make demand upon him for payment, or otherwise the such claim shall prescribe. 
(q)  After a return or report is filed under the provisions of this division, the collector shall cause to be examined and make such further audit or investigation as he may deem necessary, and if therefrom he shall determine that there is a deficiency with respect to the payment of any tax due under this division, he shall assess the additional amount of tax, and any penalties and interest, or either of them due the collector from such person, or dealer, and make demand upon him for payment. 
(r)  If the collector finds that any person or dealer liable for the payment of any tax under this division designs quickly to depart from this parish or to remove therefrom his or its property, subject to any lien under the provisions of this division, or to discontinue business, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or render wholly or partially ineffectual any proceedings that might be instituted to collect such tax, whereby it shall have become important that such proceedings be instituted without delay, the collector may make an arbitrary assessment as provided in this section, whether or not any return or report is then due by law, and may proceed under such arbitrary assessment to collect the tax, or demand security for it, and thereafter shall cause notice of such findings to be given to such a dealer, together with a demand for an immediate return or report, and immediate payment of such tax. All taxes, penalties and interest assessed pursuant to the provisions of the last three preceding subsections (o), (p) and (q), shall be paid within 15 days after notice and demand shall have been mailed to the dealer liable therefor by the collector. If such taxes, penalties and interest so assessed shall not be paid within such 15 days, there shall be added to the amount assessed, in addition to interest as provided in this section, and any other penalties provided by this division, a sum equivalent to five percent of the tax. 
(s)  If any dealer against whom taxes have been assessed under the provisions of this division shall refuse or neglect to pay such taxes within the time prescribed in this division, it shall be lawful for the collector, or his duly authorized representative, who is charged with the enforcement of collection of such taxes, to enforce collection of such taxes, together with such interest and other additional amounts as are added by law, by distraint and sale of any property or rights to property belonging to the delinquent dealer. 
(t)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if any corporation fails to file returns or to remit the sales and use taxes collected from purchasers or consumers, the collector may, as an additional means of enforcing collection, without prejudice to any other remedies at his disposal, hold those officers or directors having direct control or supervision of such taxes or charged with the responsibility of filing such returns and remitting such taxes and who willfully fail to remit or account for such taxes withheld or collected, personally liable for the total amount of such taxes withheld or collected, and not accounted for or not remitted, together with any interest, penalties and fees accruing thereon. Collection of the total amount due may be made from any one or any combination of such officers or directors who willfully fail to remit or account for such taxes withheld or collected, by use of any of the alternative remedies for the collection of taxes as provided either in R.S. 47:1561 or under any provisions of either this division or any other law. 
(u)  For any one of the following violations, in addition to being liable for the other penalties provided in this section, the party named shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $100.00, or imprisonment in jail for not more than 60 days, or both, in the discretion of the court: 
(1)  Any person who as a purchaser is obligated to report and pay the tax imposed upon any purchase made by him under section 26-69(a)-(j) and who fails, neglects and refuses to file a return thereof with the collector and pay the tax imposed thereon, within the time stated after such sale is made; 
(2)  Any dealer who shall fail, neglect, or refuse to collect the tax as provided in section 26-69(a)-(j), whether by himself or through his agents or employees; 
(3)  Any dealer violating the provisions of subsections (e) and (f) of this section; 
(4)  Any dealer who fails to permit an inspection of records by the collector as provided in section 26-72(a); 
(5)  Any wholesale dealer or jobber in this district who fails to keep records, or fails to permit an inspection of such records by the collector as provided in section 26-72(e); 
(6)  Any dealer, wholesale dealer or jobber who violates the provisions of section 26-69(d) and (e); 
(7)  Any dealer who violates the provisions of section 26-72(b); 
(8)  Any dealer failing or refusing to furnish any return as provided in section 26-71(a)-(f), or failing or refusing to furnish a supplemental return, or other data required by the collector; 
(9)  Any dealer required to make, render, sign or verify any return as provided in section 26-71(a)-(f), who makes a false or fraudulent return, with intent to evade a tax hereby levied; 
(10)  The president, executive officers, managers, and/or directors of any corporation, who shall violate the provisions of either subsections (t) or (v) of this section; provided, however, that such fine and imprisonment shall not prevent other action against the corporation as otherwise provided in this division for the recovery of the tax, interest and penalties that may be due; and 
(11)  Any person who shall violate any other provisions of this division, punishment for which is not otherwise provided in this section. 
(v)  No corporation organized under the laws of this state shall hereafter be dissolved, or effect a merger, reorganization or consolidation under any law of this state by the action of the stockholders or by the decree of any court until all taxes, fees, penalties and interest imposed on the corporation in accordance with provisions of this division shall have been paid in full. No foreign corporation which has obtained authority from this state to transact business in this parish may surrender such authority and withdraw from this state until all taxes, fees, penalties, interest, and other charges imposed upon such corporation in accordance with the provisions of this division shall have been fully paid. 
(w)  Any person or dealer who shall fail to pay any tax levied by this division on or before the day when such tax shall be required by this division to be paid, shall pay in addition to the tax, interest on the tax at the rate specified in subsection (c) of this section, for each month or fraction thereof that the tax remains unpaid, to be calculated from the date the tax was originally due to the date of actual payment. In addition, such person or dealer shall pay any special penalties provided by this division. 
(x)  All penalties and interest imposed by this division shall be payable to and recoverable by the collector in the same manner as if they were part of the tax imposed. If the failure to pay any such tax when due is explained to the satisfaction of the collector, he may at his discretion remit or waive payment of the whole or any part of any penalty or interest.

Sec. 26-75. - Refunds and reimbursements. 
(a)  Whenever tangible personal property sold is returned to the dealer by the purchaser or consumer or in the event the amount paid or charged for services is refunded or credited to the purchaser or consumer after the tax imposed by this division has been collected or charged to the account of the purchaser, consumer or user, the dealer shall be entitled to reimbursement of the amount of tax so collected or charged by him, in the manner prescribed by the collector. In case the tax has not been remitted by the dealer to the collector, the dealer may deduct the tax in submitting his return. Upon receipt of a sworn statement of the dealer as to the gross amount of such refunds during the period covered by the sworn statement, which period shall not be longer than 90 days, the collector shall issue to the dealer an official credit memorandum equal to the net amount remitted by the dealer for the tax collected. Such memorandum shall be accepted by the collector at full face value from the dealer to whom it is issued, in the remittance for subsequent taxes accrued under the provisions of this division. In cases where a dealer has retired from business and has filed a final return, a refund of tax may be made if it can be established to the satisfaction of the collector that the tax paid was not due. 
(b)  If any dealer shall have given to the collector notice within the time provided in subsection (a) of this section, such dealer thereafter, at any time within two years after the payment of any original or additional tax assessed against him, may file with the collector a claim under oath for refund, in such form as the collector may prescribe, stating the grounds of such claim. However, no claim for refund shall be required or permitted to be filed with respect to a tax paid, after protest has been filed with the collector as provided in this section, or after proceeding on appeal has been finally determined. 
(c)  If, upon examination of such claim for refund, it shall be determined by the collector that there has been an overpayment of tax, the amount of such overpayment shall be credited against any liability of any dealer under this division, and if there be no such liability, the such dealer shall be entitled to a refund of the tax so overpaid. If the collector shall reject the claim for refund, in whole or in part, he shall make an order accordingly and serve notice upon such dealer. 
(d)  When, to secure compliance with any of the provisions of this division, any moneys shall have been deposited with the collector by any dealer, and shall have been paid over to the collector, and the collector shall be satisfied that such dealer has fully complied with all such provisions, the collector shall so certify and authorize repayment from any appropriations available for such purpose to such dealer of such moneys, or such part thereof as the collector shall certify has not been applied by him to the satisfaction of any indebtedness arising under this division.

Sec. 26-76. - Remedies of dealer. 
(a)  A right of action is hereby created to afford a remedy at law for any dealer aggrieved by the provisions of this division; and in case of any such dealer resisting the payment of any amount found due, or the enforcement of any provisions of such laws in relations thereto, such dealer shall pay the amount found due by the collector and shall give the collector notice, at the time, of his intention to file suit for the recovery of such amount. Upon receipt of such notice, the amount so paid shall be segregated and held by the collector for a period of 30 days, and if suit is filed within such time for recovery of such amount, such funds so segregated shall be further held, pending the outcome of such suit. If the dealer prevails, the collector shall refund the amount to the claimant, with interest at the rate of two percent per annum covering the period from the date the funds were received by the collector to the date of refund. 
(b)  This section shall be construed to provide a legal remedy in the state, city or federal courts, by action of law, in case such taxes are claimed to be an unlawful burden upon interstate commerce, or the collection thereof, in violation of any Act of Congress or the United States Constitution, or in any case where jurisdiction is vested in any of the courts of the United States; provided, however, that upon written request of the dealer and upon proper showing by such dealer that the principle of law involved in an additional assessment is already pending before the courts for judicial determination, the dealer, upon agreement to abide by the decision of the courts may pay the additional assessment under protest, but need not file an additional suit. In such cases the tax so paid under protest shall be segregated and held by the collector until the question of law involved has been determined by the courts and shall then be disposed of as therein provided. 
(c)  If any dealer shall be aggrieved by any finding or assessment of the collector, he may, within 30 days of the receipt of notice of the assessment or finding, file a protest in writing signed by him or his duly authorized agent, which shall be under oath and shall set forth the reasons therefor, and he may request a hearing. Thereafter, the collector shall grant a hearing to such dealer, if a hearing has been requested, and may make an order confirming, modifying or vacating any such finding or assessment. The filing of any such protest shall not abate any penalty for nonpayment, nor shall it stay the right of the collector to collect the tax in any manner provided in this section unless the dealer shall furnish security of a kind and in an amount satisfactory to the collector. Appeals from the decision of the collector shall be direct to any state, city or federal court of competent jurisdiction as provided for in subsection (b) of this section.

(d)  The cost of preparing and distributing the report forms and paraphernalia for the collection of such tax, and of the inspection and enforcement duties required in this section, shall be borne by the collector.

The provisions of this section shall also apply where such tangible personal property is not sold but is used, consumed, distributed, stored, leased or rented, and where services taxable under this division are contracted for before the effective date of Ordinance No. 2487, but are actually furnished after such date. The provisions of this section shall not apply to tangible personal property actually imported or caused to be imported into, or stored within, the territorial limits of the district prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 2487, if the such tangible personal property is actually used or consumed by the person who imported and stored such tangible personal property. 
(f)  It shall be lawful for the collector, or any deputy by him duly designated, to receive the written oath of any person signing any application, disposition, statement or report required by the collector in the administration of this division.

The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of its receipt by the dealer to whom it is addressed. 
(i)  The collector shall maintain official copies of this division, which may be authenticated under his official signature, and when so authenticated, shall be evidence in all courts of the state of the same weight and force as the original. For authenticating of any such copy, he shall be paid a fee of $5.00. 
(j)  Nothing in this division shall be construed to deprive the dealer of any remedy in the review of any tax, or in any proceedings to collect the tax given such dealer by any other law, or to deprive the collector of any remedy for the enforcement of this division through any procedure or remedies expressly provided in this division imposing the tax levied in this division or in any other law, nor shall this division be construed as repealing or altering any such laws, ordinances or resolutions. 
(k)  If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this division be held invalid, such decisions shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this division.

Sec. 26-80. - Intergovernmental agreement between parish sales tax district no. 3 of the parish and cities in the parish in connection with the reconstruction and maintenance of roads; terms. 
(a)  Collection of sales tax. The sales tax district will collect its two percent sales tax approved by the voters throughout the area comprising the sales tax district on November 4, 1986, the date of the sales tax election. The sales tax district will use the proceeds from its sales tax to construct, overlay and improve roads throughout the sales tax district, and to fund the tax proceeds into bonds for these purposes, in accordance with the priority road listings previously established by ordinance. Except as may hereafter be agreed by resolution of the St. Tammany Parish Police Jury, cities agree to use any amounts paid by the district pursuant to this agreement solely for road, bridge and drainage purposes. The parties mutually agree that the district sales tax presently is effective for the entire area of St. Tammany Parish, excluding the incorporated municipal boundaries as of November 4, 1986, the date of the sales tax election. Areas that were annexed by municipalities by valid ordinances effective prior to November 4, 1986, are not within the area subject to the district sales tax and thus not subject to this agreement. In addition to sales taxes collected by the state and the St. Tammany Parish School Board, the parties agree that, after signing of this agreement, a maximum of two percent sales tax for district and municipal purposes is effective for all properties located in the district and annexed into a municipality by ordinances adopted and published after November 4, 1986, collectable as follows: 
(1)  Developed commercial properties. Dealers in retail sales on these parcels shall collect only the district's two percent sales tax and remit the entire amount to the district. These dealers shall not be required to collect city sales taxes. The entire net proceeds of these taxes shall be retained by the district. 
(2)  Undeveloped commercial properties. Dealers in retail sales on these parcels shall collect only the district's two percent sales tax and remit the entire amount to the district. An amount equal to 50 percent of the net proceeds of these taxes shall be paid to the appropriate city at the time and in the manner specified in this section. The net sales tax revenues shall be those received by the district after accounting for all expenses of collection. 
(3)  Manufacturers Retail Outlet development and Northshore Limited Partnership development on Airport Road. Sales by dealers in retail sales on these properties shall be governed by the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of this section. The city agrees to pay to the district an amount equal to 50 percent of the net proceeds of the city's sales taxes collected from those portions of these two developments annexed into the city prior to November 4, 1986. The city is empowered to recoup fully its initial costs of extending services to these properties and improvements to Airport Road prior to initiating disbursements to the district. The costs associated with the Northshore Limited Partnership development are fixed at $556,119.00. The estimated costs associated with the Manufacturers Retail Outlet development are $800,000.00. Payments by the city to the district shall be made within 15 days of the end of each calendar month. The properties subject to this subparagraph are more fully delineated on Exhibits A and B [4] attached hereto and made a part hereof. 
(4)  Sales taxable at point of delivery. Sales by retail dealers and collectors of sales taxes levied at point of delivery rather than point of sale shall be governed by subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, as the case may be. By the term "developed" property is meant that parcel of land annexed by the municipality which contains a business making retail sales or producing sales tax revenue at the time of annexation or within three years prior to annexation. A parcel will not be deemed developed due solely to the fact that the parcel being annexed is adjacent to, contiguous with or derived from an area of developed land (as defined above) of common ownership with the parcel to be annexed. All other property not falling within the definition of "developed" shall be considered "undeveloped". This agreement is meant to apply only to existing sales taxes. Additional sales taxes which may be levied in the future by the party to this agreement shall be entirely payable to the levying entity. 
(b)  Responsibility for road maintenance and improvements. The district will be responsible for making initial improvements according to parish specification to roads listed in Ordinance Calendar No. 767, Ordinance Police Jury Series No. 86-693, dated August 21, 1986, as amended to date, to the extent funding is available, whether or not these roads are annexed into a municipality. The annexing municipality shall be responsible for the maintenance and subsequent paving of all roads and bridges within properties annexed by the municipality. 
(c)  Bondholders' rights. The sales tax district has issued bonds payable from the district's two percent sales tax pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the St. Tammany Parish Police Jury on November 19, 1987, as amended and supplemented by an ordinance adopted on May 19, 1988, (collectively the "bond ordinance"). The bond ordinance specifies the manner in which proceeds of the district's two percent sales tax must be administered and handled (copy of section 5.03 of the bond ordinance being annexed hereto as Exhibit C [5]). All payments from the district to the city required to be made hereunder shall be made on a monthly basis and be paid solely from monies considered surplus as defined in section 5.03 of the bond ordinance. If the sales tax revenues derived by a city are at any time insufficient to make mandatory payments required by ordinances authorizing sales tax revenue bonds of the city, the city may collect its two percent sales tax (in addition to the district's two percent sales tax) until the deficit is satisfied. The city shall cease the collection if and when the sales tax revenues become sufficient to pay the mandatory payments due on the bonds. 
(d)  Zoning of annexed properties. 
(1)  If a city, after the adoption of this agreement, annexes property into the municipality and enacts a zoning classification for that property that permits more intense commercial, industrial or land uses than the zoning classification adopted for the property by the parish prior to the annexation, the sales tax district shall not be obligated to honor this agreement as to that property. However, upon application by the annexing municipality, the police jury may agree to the change in zoning and, if it does agree, the annexed property shall be subject to this agreement. Any request for a zoning change that permits any such more intense land uses shall be forwarded to the police jury by certified mall, return receipt requested. If the police jury does not deny the request within 60 days of receipt of the request, it shall be deemed approved by the parish. Once a conceptual development plan and a PD or PUD zoning classification are established for a property, as provided above, further zoning actions consistent with that plan and classification shall not require parish approval. 
(2)  The provisions of this subsection (d) shall not apply to properties 90 percent surrounded by a city, exclusive of roads. 
(3)  Upon receipt of any request to annex an area, the city agrees to notify the police jury member in whose district the property is located by certified mail. 
(e)  Pledge of cooperations. The parties hereto pledge their mutual cooperation in complying with the terms of the agreement, all to the end that the welfare of the residents of St. Tammany Parish shall be promoted and that the needs of the residents may be satisfactorily met. 
(f)  Termination and miscellaneous. This agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto for a period of 20 years from December 1, 1986. This agreement may be amended from time to time by the participating cities and the parish and district with the approval of their respective governing authorities. Division headnotes (subcatchlines) used above are for purposes of convenience only and shall have no legal bearing upon the construction of this agreement. This agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of parties hereto, its/their successors and assigns. It is the intent of the parties that this agreement shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes. 
(g)  New parties. No agreement shall be offered to any municipality without also offering it to all municipalities. 
(h)  Closing. If any one or more provisions of this agreement is for any reason held to be illegal or invalid, this entire agreement, except for this subsection, shall immediately become null and void. All parties agree to attempt in good faith to adopt a new agreement, which to the extent possible, accomplishes the same results as this agreement. Further, all parties agree to negotiate in good faith, refrain from challenging the validity or legality of this agreement and join in the defense of any legal challenge to this agreement. Legal expenses incurred in the defense of any challenge to this agreement shall be split by all parties proportionately by population unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. Any constitutional or statutory provisions enacted after the date of this agreement which validates or makes legal any provision of this section shall be deemed to apply hereto.

S 
= .00834 vs ($ A (BOD-230) + $ B (SS-250)). 
WHERE: 
S 
= Surcharge in dollars monthly. 
.00834 
= Conversion factor from milligrams per liter to pounds per 1,000 gallons. 
vs 
= Sewage volume in 1,000 gallons per month = 85 percent metered water volume in thousands of gallons per month. 
A 
= Unit charge for BOD in dollars per pound. 
230 
= Allowable BOD in milligrams per liter by weight. 
BOD 
= The biochemical oxygen demand (standard tests) taken at five days in milligrams per liter by weight as measured. 
$B 
= Unit charge for suspended solids in dollars per pound. 
250 
= Allowable SS in milligrams per liter by weight. 
SS

Such notice shall be mailed to the owner at the address shown on the permit application or as known to the city, and a copy may be delivered to the permit holder or the person in charge of the facility or posted conspicuously on the property affected. The city may (but shall not be required to) give such further additional notice as in the discretion of the city is convenient or desirable. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the city shall determine whether grounds exist for suspension or revocation, for termination and/or for disconnection of service. If such grounds are found to exist, the permit shall forthwith be suspended or revoked and service shall forthwith be terminated and sanitary and waste disposal and water facilities forthwith disconnected. A copy of such decision shall be sent by certified mail to the owner at the address shown on the permit or as known to the city and a copy shall be delivered to the facility or posted conspicuously on the property; provided, however, that the service of such copy of the decision shall not be a condition precedent or subsequent to suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection. 
(2)  Restoration of service. Any person whose permit has been suspended or revoked under this section, or for whom service has been terminated and disconnection effected under this section, may petition the city for reinstatement of the permit and reinstatement of service. Such petition shall be verified under the oath or declaration under penalty of perjury of the person petitioning. Such petition shall contain a detailed statement of the corrective action taken by the petitioner or others to remove the grounds for suspension or revocation, termination and disconnection, and of the corrective measures or devices to prevent a repetition of the offense and of proposed security against further violation. Such petition shall contain the name and address of the petitioner for purposes of receiving notice. Such petition shall be filed with the city. Such petition shall be heard within 35 days of the date of receipt by the city. Notice of time, date and place of hearing shall be given to the petitioner at least ten days before the hearing in writing by certified mail to such petitioner at the address shown on the petition. At the hearing the city shall consider evidence presented by the petitioner in support of his petition and evidence in opposition. The city, at its discretion, may restore the permit, service and connection if it finds that the grounds for suspension, revocation, termination and disconnection have been corrected and that there is adequate assurance from the petitioner of corrective measures or devices to prevent a repetition of the offense for which the permit was suspended, revoked and service terminated and disconnected or for any other reasons deemed fit and appropriate by the city. The city may, as a condition to the restoration of the permit, service and connection: 
a.  Require the petitioner to provide reasonable safeguards and security to avoid a repetition of the offense for which the permit was suspended, revoked and service terminated and disconnected. 
b.  Impose reasonable charges to compensate the city for expenses incurred in connection with the suspension, revocation, termination and disconnection and in connection with the reinstatement of the permit and the restoration of service and reconnection.

In no event shall the movement be more than is reasonable and necessary.

    The zoning commission has given reasonable consideration, among other things, to the character of the districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city. The zoning commission has made a preliminary report and held public hearings thereon and submitted its final report to the city council. The council has given due public notice of hearings relating to zoning districts, regulations, and restrictions. 
    All requirements of R.S. 33:4721-33:4729 with regard to the preparation of the report of the zoning commission and the subsequent action of the city council have been met.

Section 2.15. - Planned unit development (PUD). 
2.1501 
Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose of the planned unit development regulations is to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design for land developments than is possible under district zoning regulations and not circumvent zoning requirements. The planned unit development also provides for more efficient use of the land and shall result in more economical land development, preservation of natural site qualities, better urban amenities, more open space, greater attention to architectural design, increased landscaping and a higher quality project. 
(b)  The following objectives shall be obtained through the use of the planned unit development procedure: 
(1)  To permit a maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict application of the other sections of this ordinance. 
(2)  To promote a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that results in better design and development, with the inclusion of aesthetic amenities including an increased amount of landscaping. 
(3)  To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and building relationships with a possible mixing of different urban uses in an innovative design. 
(4)  To encourage a pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic and geological features, and environmentally appropriate features. 
(5)  To provide for the prevention and/or control of soil erosion, surface flooding, and the preservation of subsurface water. 
(6)  To create a method for the permanent preservation of common open space for the continued use and enjoyment of the residents of the development. 
(7)  To provide for more usable and suitably located recreation facilities, schools, and other public and private facilities. 
(8)  To promote a land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and welfare. 
(9)  To create a method for the permanent preservation of architectural and/or historic landmarks. 
(c)  The planned unit development is intended to provide for projects incorporating a single type or variety of related uses which are planned and developed as a unit. The planned unit development shall provide amenities not otherwise required by law and shall establish facilities and open space greater than the minimum required by law. 
(d)  Such development may consist of conventionally subdivided lots to be sold, unsubdivided single ownership, separate condominium ownership of structures, or other ownership methods and shall provide for development by means of a planned unit development plat which establishes the location and extent of the features of the planned unit development in keeping with the purpose of the planned unit. 
(e)  The unique and substantially different character of planned unit developments require their administrative processing as a "special rezoning" in this ordinance. Planned unit developments are more complex and of a different character than other zoning classifications, requiring the establishment herein of specific and additional procedures, standards, and exceptions to govern the recommendations of the zoning commission and the action of the city council. 
2.1502 
Interpretation. 
(a)  The basic provisions and requirements concerning planned unit developments are as follows: The subdivision, development and use of land as an integral unit, combining more than one primary land use which may provide for single-family residential, multiple-family residential, educational, business, commercial, industrial, recreational, park and common open areas, is described as a planned unit development. 
(b)  In its establishment and authorization as a special zoning classification, in addition to the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, requirements, restrictions, standards, and conditions contained herein shall be observed: 
  The planned unit development may be excepted from the provisions of the subdivision regulations and of the zoning ordinance of the City of Slidell to the extent specified in this ordinance and in the final authorization of the planned unit development as specified in an ordinance approved by the city council. 
2.1503

2.2001 
Location. This light industrial district shall replace the M-2 light industrial district as said district existed on the effective date of this ordinance. The use limitations provided by this ordinance shall extend to any other land annexed by or otherwise acquired by the city for industrial purposes until a land use plan has been completed by the city and adopted by the city council after which time such acquired land may be rezoned in a fashion compatible with such land use plan. Any rezoning proposed for any Slidell industrially zoned district within 300 feet of a parish boundary shall be referred to the St. Tammany Parish Department of Development which shall be given at least 30 days in which to comment in writing on such proposal before any Slidell rezoning shall take effect. 
(1)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply within the M-2 light industrial district of the City of Slidell: 
(a)  Assembly. Assembly shall be the fitting together of manufactured parts in a machine, structure or unit which is complete in and of itself or into components which may be further fitted together and where such assembly takes place within an enclosed building with both walls and roof. 
(b)  Manufacturing. Manufacturing shall be the process of making goods or wares from raw materials by hand or machinery when that process takes place within an enclosed building with both walls and roof. 
(c)  Retail; retail services or retailing. Retailing shall be the sale of goods or services to the public. Services may include cleaning, maintenance and repair insofar as these services are conducted in accordance with the environmental requirements of section 2.1901 of this ordinance. Storage of goods for retail sale or service shall meet the requirements for storage established for wholesaling. 
(d)  Wholesaling. The storage and sale of goods or wastes for the purpose of further sale to a distributor or retail merchant. Wholesaling shall not include final sales to the public which shall be considered retailing. A warehouse provided for wholesale goods storage shall meet requirements for warehouses in the commercially zoned area of the city. 
(e)  Research services. Refers to establishments primarily engaged in research of an industrial or scientific nature but shall not include chemical, biological, nuclear or animal research. 
(2)  Permitted uses. Assembly, retailing, wholesaling, research services, as defined here in and such uses as are permitted in the C-4 commercial zone shall be permitted in the light industrial zone. No structure or land shall be devoted to any other use than a use permitted hereunder with the exception of those cases where such were lawfully established prior to the effective date of this ordinance. Any permitted use shall conform to the environmental standards and requirements of section 2.1901 of this ordinance. 
(3)  Conditional uses. Manufacturing uses as defined herein may be permitted as a conditional use in the M-2 district in accordance with section 2.2215. Conditional uses must comply with the environmental standards contained in section 2.1901. 
(4)  Permit required. In addition to any building permits required, the operator of a proposed use in the M-2 industrial district shall file a written application for a zoning permit. Said application shall also be required for any expansion, enlargement, or change to any existing permits. This permit shall be designed by the department of planning and will require a full description of the use to be undertaken, the method and materials to be used in any assembly, manufacturing, or wholesaling operation in the industrial district effective after the adoption of this ordinance. The use authorized by this permit shall be approved as conforming to the letter and spirit of the zoning ordinance prior to the application to the department of permits for any building permit. There shall be no expansion or modification of any permitted use until a zoning review application for such improvements has been filed with the city and approved by the department of planning and department of permits. 
Where there is a question on the part of the department of planning if the proposed use might violate the environmental standards established in section 2.1901, the applicant shall furnish to the director of planning, at the applicant's expense, such engineering or other environmental data that will satisfy the director of planning that the environmental standards will be met. However, such approval of the application by the director of planning shall not relieve the applicant of meeting the requirements of section 2.1901 when the approved use is undertaken. Applicants aggrieved by the decision of the director of planning may file an appeal with the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment in making its decision may require engineering or environmental analysis of the proposed operation by an independent consulting firm or firms. The cost of any such reviews shall be borne by the applicant. Copies of the zoning permit application shall be kept on file at the department of planning and be available for public scrutiny. Misrepresentation, falsification or significant omission on the application shall cause the permit to be null and void. 
Complaints that a zoning use is in violation of the permit or environmental standards imposed by section 2.1901 shall in the first instance be investigated by the department of engineering. If the department needs additional engineering or environmental analysis or consultation to make a determination, it shall employ such consultation.

2.2205 
Airport hazard height limitations. There are hereby created certain height limitations over all of the land lying within the flight approach zones, horizontal zones, and conical zones of any official airport within the jurisdiction of this ordinance. Such zones are shown on the official zoning map and when in effect over an established zoning district it is intended that the most restrictive height limits shall apply. 
(A)  Definitions: 
(1)  Airport means the Slidell Airport and any future official airport which shall be constructed. 
(2)  Airport elevation means the established elevation of the highest point on the usable landing areas. (This point is 15 feet mean sea level at the Slidell Airport). 
(3)  Airport hazard means any structure, tree, or use of land which obstructs the airspace required for or is otherwise hazardous to the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at the airport. 
(4)  Airport reference point means the point established as the approximate geographic center of the airport landing area and so designated. 
(5)  Height for the purpose of determining the height limits set forth on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
(6)  Landing area means the area of the airport used for the landing, takeoff or taxiing of aircraft. 
(7)  Nonconforming use means any structure, tree, or use of land which is lawfully in existence at the time the ordinance is adopted or amended to cause a nonconforming use.

(9)  Runway means the paved surface of an airport landing strip. 
(10)  Structure means an object constructed or installed by man including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks, and overhead transmission lines. 
(B)  Airport height zones. 
(1)  Instrument approach zone. At such time as an instrument approach is installed at an airport in the parish the instrument approach zone shall extend from each end of the instrument runway at a distance of 200 feet, with a width of 1,000 feet. It shall widen uniformly thereafter for a distance of 50,200 feet with an ultimate width of 16,000 feet. Its centerline shall be the continuation of the centerline of the runway. There were no runways in the parish with instrument approaches in 1965. 
(2)  Noninstrument approach zone. A noninstrument approach zone is established at each end of all noninstrument runways for noninstrument landings and takeoffs. The noninstrument runway shall have a width of 250 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 2,250 feet at a distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(3)  Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established adjacent to each instrument and noninstrument runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones symmetrically located on either side of runways have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward from a line 200 feet on either side of the centerline of the noninstrument runway for the length of such runway plus 200 feet on each end and 500 feet on either side of the centerline of the instrument runway, for the length of such runway plus 200 feet at each end and are parallel and level with such runway centerlines. The transition zones along such runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are established adjacent to both instrument and noninstrument approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Such transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of such zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones. Additionally, transition zones are established adjacent to the instrument approach zone where it projects through and beyond the limits of the conical zones, extending a distance of 5,000 feet, measured horizontally from the edge of the instrument approach zones at right angles to the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(4)  Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is hereby established as the area within a circle with its center at the airport reference point and having a radius of 5,000 feet. The horizontal zone does not include the instrument and noninstrument approach zones and the transition zones. 
(5)  Conical zone. A conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a distance of 3,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the instrument approach zones. 
(C)  Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone created by this ordinance to a height limit herein established for such zone. Such height limit actions are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Instrument approach zone. One foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of 10,200 feet from the end of the runway; thence one foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
(2)  Noninstrument approach zones. One foot in height for each 20 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the elevation of the end of the noninstrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
(3)  Transition zones. One foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at any point 250 feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of noninstrument runways extending 200 feet beyond each end thereof and 500 feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of the instrument runway, extending 200 feet beyond each end thereof, extending to a height of 150 feet above airport elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one foot vertical height for each seven feet horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces. Further, where the instrument approach zone projects through and beyond the conical zone, a height limit of one foot for each seven feet of horizontal distance shall be maintained beginning at the edge of the instrument approach zone and extending a distance of 5,000 feet from the edge of the instrument approach zone measured normal to the centerline of the runway extended. 
(4)  Horizontal zone. One hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation or a height of 168 feet above mean sea level. 
(5)  Conical zone. One foot in height for each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone, extending to a height of 273 feet mean sea level above the Slidell Airport elevation. 
Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. 
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to 45 feet above the surface of the land. 
(D)  Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this ordinance in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish airport lights and other, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(E)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulation as of the effective date of this ordinance or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance and is diligently prosecuted. 
(2)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport authority to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the airport authority. 
2.2206 
Minimum slab or floor elevation. Notwithstanding other provisions of this ordinance, except as provided in section 2.301 of this ordinance, the main slab or floor elevation shall not be less than seven feet above mean sea level in all districts. 
2.2207 
Buffer zone requirements shall be as set forth in subsections 2.2208 through 2.2212 below. 
2.2208 
Purpose. The location of intense residential uses, commercial uses and industrial uses adjacent to single-family and other low density residential uses negatively affect the desirability and consequently the value of the low density residential properties. Similar problems can exist between commercial and industrial uses. Buffer zones can modify and minimize these impacts. The intent of this section of the Slidell zoning ordinance is to ensure that protection is afforded adjacent property users. 
2.2209 
Applicability. The buffer zone will be required as per the following table: 
L.D.R. H.D.R. C. L.I. H.I. Low Density Res. (LDR) X* X X X High Density Res. (HDR) X X X Commercial (C) X X Light Industrial (LI) X Heavy Industrial (HI)  
*Indicates buffer zone required. 
The developer will be responsible for installing and the landowner for maintaining the buffer zone. In situations where a property use predates the enactment of this ordinance, and a lower intensity development containing two or more lots is proposed for an abutting parcel, the low intensity developer is required to install a buffer zone as per the provisions of this ordinance. 
2.2210 
Buffer zone fence required. A six-foot opaque fence shall be constructed on the abutting lines requiring a buffer zone. In all cases, said fence shall extend six feet above the highest point of ground elevation of the property requiring a buffer zone or the property to be buffered, whichever is higher. The fence will be constructed according to the following performance standards: 
(1)  Fences shall have a minimum of 1 5/8 inches diameter galvanized pipe supports. 
(2)  Supports shall be placed no more than seven feet apart. 
(3)  Fencing shall be constructed of weatherproofed wood of grade 1 or grade 2 lumber. 
(4)  Fencing shall be solid with no spacing between pickets. 
(5)  Fence style shall be of notched picket or combinations thereof. 
(6)  When a fence is constructed of soft pine or other soft wood there shall be three rails. Cedar and other hardwoods require only two rails. 
The fence shall be installed prior to issuance of a building permit. 
In the event that there exists on the property in either zone a fence meeting the construction requirements, said fence being within 12 inches of the abutting property lines, no additional fence shall be required to be built if one of the following conditions is met: 
(1)  The fence and property on which it is situated are owned by the owner of the higher density property; 
(2)  The owner of the higher density property obtains from the owner of the low density property permission to be responsible for the maintenance and necessary repairs of the fence and ensure its continued effectiveness as a buffer in perpetuity. This agreement shall be in writing and recorded with the clerk of court for the Parish of St. Tammany prior to issuance of a building permit. 
Further, if in response to federal flood zone requirements, city drainage requirements or other events the grade of the high density, commercial or industrial zoned property is raised, the owner of said property will at that time be required to provide a buffer zone fence meeting the requirements of this section. 
2.2211 
Buffer zone landscape requirements. A ten-foot landscaped area shall be provided by the developer. Trees shall be planted in the ten-foot strip so as to provide a further screening of the development from the abutting property. 
2.2212 
Trees selection, installation and inspection: See sections 2.2516, 2.2517, and 2.2518. 
2.2213 
Liquor by the drink establishments prohibited in shopping centers; exception. Lounges, barrooms and similar establishments selling low- and high-content alcoholic beverages by the drink to be consumed on the premises are hereby prohibited from locating within shopping centers. The provisions of this section shall not apply to bonafide restaurants and cafeterias as defined by section 10-22(3)e of the Slidell Code of Ordinances or to dinner theaters showing legitimate theatrical stage plays or movies to patrons seated at tables. 
2.2214 
Home occupation. In all residential districts, any home occupation shall be permitted, provided that: 
(a)  All business activities conducted upon the premises are conducted within the dwelling by a member or members of the immediate family by blood or marriage residing in the dwelling and such business activities are incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for dwelling purposes. The dwelling used for the home occupation must be the principal residence of the resident conducting the home occupation, evidenced by voter registration or driver's license registration at that location. 
(b)  It is not conducted from a detached or attached accessory structure including garages, carports, porches, or utility sheds or any addition to the dwelling that is not a part of the principal structure or accessible from within the principal structure. Swimming pools may be used to conduct swimming lessons. 
(c)  It does not involve or require any alterations to the interior or exterior of the building that would in any way affect the use of the building as a dwelling or make the building appear in any way as anything but a dwelling. 
(d)  Not more than 25 percent of the floor area of a story of the dwelling where the activity is to be conducted shall be used for the home occupation. 
(e)  There is no display or activity that will indicate from the exterior of the dwelling that it is being used, in whole or in part, for any other use than a dwelling. Nothing shall be done to make the building appear in any way as anything but a dwelling.

Conditional use permits. In order to accomplish the general purpose of these regulations, there are certain uses which must be recognized in addition to the regular permitted uses of a district because of unusual characteristics or the service they provide the public. Because the principle objective of this zoning ordinance is to promote an orderly arrangement of compatible building and land uses, these conditional uses require special regulation to achieve a compatibility with existing or planned development. Often the effect of these uses on the surrounding environment cannot be foreseen and evaluated until a specific site has been proposed. The conditions controlling the location and operation of such conditional uses are established by the following provisions of this ordinance: 
(A)  Approval. The Slidell city council with the recommendation of the zoning commission shall have the authority to permit the conditional use of land or structures for uses designated as conditional uses in each zoning district in accordance with the procedures, conditions, and standards in this ordinance. 
(B)  Conditions. 
(1)  The proposed special use will comply with all applicable regulations in the zoning district in which the property in question is located. 
(2)  The zoning commission may attach such conditions to the conditional use as are necessary to assure continuous conformance to all applicable standards and requirements so as to prevent the use from negatively impacting on adjacent land uses and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. 
(3)  Failure to observe the conditions of the commission, imposed pursuant to the issuance of the conditional use, shall be deemed to be a violation of these regulations and may be grounds for revocation of the conditional use. Any person found to be in violation of a conditional use permit shall be subject to the penalties prescribed in section 3.402 of the zoning ordinance. 
(4)  The zoning commission may approve uses subject to the regulations, and to any additional requirements imposed in the public interest to cover circumstances unique to the selected site including drainage, traffic and environmental analysis of the site and surrounding property by an independent engineering firm to be selected by the city. The cost of such studies shall be borne by the applicant. 
(C)  General standards. 
(1)  The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in (or conducted in connection with) the use, the size of the site in relation to the use, and the location of the site with respect to neighboring land uses and to streets giving access to the site shall be such that the use will be in harmony with the land uses in the district in which it is located. 
(2)  Time limit requirement for length of permit use. 
(3)  Hours of operation for use, buffering and/or landscaping above the minimum ordinance requirements. 
(4)  The location, nature and height of structures, walls and fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the development and use of adjacent land and structures. 
(5)  Parking areas shall be of adequate size for the particular use, properly located and suitably screened from adjoining residential uses, and the ingress and egress drives shall be laid so as to achieve maximum safety. 
(6)  Adequate utilities, drainage and other necessary facilities have been or will be provided. 
(7)  Environmental safety devices shall be employed as is necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
(D)  Application. A written application verified by the owner of record or authorized agent of said owner of the property involved shall be filed with the department of planning for the attention of the zoning commission upon a form prescribed therefor, which shall contain, or be accompanied by, all required information. The written application shall be in such a form and accompanied by such information as shall be prescribed from time to time by the zoning commission, but shall in any event include the following:

(5)  Zoning and use. The present zoning of the property and description of intended use. 
(6)  Site plan. A site plan drawn to a scale of not less than one inch to 100 feet or as designated by the director of planning, showing the subject site, the length and location of its boundaries, the location and proposed use of all existing and proposed structures and the proposed use of all areas of the site not enclosed by a building including parking areas, storage areas, maintenance areas, loading areas, and production areas, the site plan shall also indicate the zoning of all land within 300 feet of the subject site. 
(7)  Other materials. Such other data or materials as the zoning commission finds necessary to appraise the need for or effect of the special use.

Upon rendering its decision the secretary of the commission shall, within seven working days, report the commission's decision and findings to the clerk of the council. Upon receiving the recommendations of the zoning commission, the city council may approve or deny the special use permit request in accordance with the recommendation of the zoning commission or establish its own conditions or restrictions upon the construction, location, and operation of a special use as it deems necessary to secure the required standards found in section 2.2215(C). 
(F)  Period of validity. Every special use permit shall become null and void six months after the date it is granted by the city council, unless:

(2)  A building permit is obtained pursuant to such special use permits and construction work pursuant to such building permit is actually begun within the six-month period, and the construction work is carried on diligently to completion in accordance with such building permit. 
(3)  The city council may extend the time period for an additional six months where such extension is deemed reasonably necessary. 
(4)  Abandoned or discontinued. If any special use is abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, the special use permit for such use shall become null and void, and such use may not thereafter be reestablished unless a new special use permit is obtained in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(5)  Transfer of permit. Unless differently conditioned in the requirements of the permit, or unless revoked by the city council, or abandoned, special use permits shall remain valid for a specific special use on a specific piece of property, even though that use or property may change ownership, manager, occupancy, or operator, provided that the special use complies with the requirements and regulations of the special use permit. 
(a)  Required acknowledgment. The owner of a parcel of property which is the subject of a special use permit shall supply all successive owners, all managers, occupants, and operators of the special use on the property or the property itself with a copy of the permit authorizing the special use and all related requirements and regulations.

n.  Shadows shall be considered as a design element. 
2.  Materials: Materials shall be reviewed for compliance with historic context. The following materials have historic context: 
a.  Walls: Wood, brick, and cement plaster (stucco). 
b.  Roofing: Wood shakes, slate/tile, rigid shingles with ridge tiles, metal (corrugated, V-crimp, and standing seam).

d.  Fees. Effective July 1, 2015 there shall be an annual fee for billboard panels and a one-time fee if a billboard panel is converted to digital.

(B)  Appeals to the board of adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the administrative officer. Appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof.

(C)  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in his opinion, cause imminent peril of life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order that may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.

(1)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if a strict letter of regulations were not carried out. 
(2)  The conditions upon which the petition for a variation is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification. 
(3)  The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by the ordinance and has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property. 
(4)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(5)  The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property value within the neighborhood. 
(6)  The variation will not serve as a precedent which, in effect, will rewrite a provision of this ordinance. 
(C)  The board of adjustment may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this subsection, to reduce or minimize the effect of such variations upon other property in the neighborhood and to better carry out the general intent of the ordinance.

APPENDIX B - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS[1] 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
    In order to ensure proper development of the City of Slidell, the subdivision of land should, through proper standards, provide for adequate light, air, open spaces, drainage, transportation, public utilities, and ensure the development and maintenance of a healthy, attractive community. At the same time, these regulations should provide for the conservation and protection of human and natural resources. Therefore, to develop raw land for residential, commercial, industrial, schools, parks, and other public uses, as well as streets and public access, eight steps for good development are proposed as follows: 
(1)  Subdivider sees the city engineer for street, sewerage, water and other utility specifications and Slidell planning commission for preapplication conference. 
(2)  Subdivider arrives at preliminary conclusion. If he decides to continue, reaches tentative agreement or understanding with those associated with him and others concerned such as the lender and the FHA; prepares a preliminary plat for submission to the planning commission. 
(3)  Planning commission review. Developer submits official filing of the subdivision to city planning commission. Planning commission reviews general layout, street right-of-way widths, etc. and will make suggestions and recommendations to the developer. 
    The commission may grant tentative approval to preliminary plat. Provisions for approval will be made known at this time. If commission grants tentative approval, an original tracing of the subdivision plan and two prints should be submitted for signing by the chairman or secretary of Slidell planning commission. The planning commission may require that a public hearing be held regarding the proposed subdivision. 
(4)  Project engineer formulates preliminary engineering design and reviews the same with the city engineer. City engineer reviews engineering as to how proposed subdivision affects: 
(a)  Water; 
(b)  Drainage; 
(c)  Sewerage; 
(d)  Street access. 
    Plans must show how proposed subdivision relates to surrounding subdivisions. It must show contours and elevations and relates to a U.S.C. & G. [now National Geodetic Survey] benchmark. City engineer will review and make his recommendations known to project engineer. 
(5)  After tentative approval of preliminary plat by the planning commission and city engineer, the project engineer will prepare detailed construction drawings for off-site improvements. 
    The subdivider shall submit a tracing and two prints of a survey and subdivision plan which shows existing and proposed property lines, lot dimensions and lot designations, servitudes, etc., and all existing improvements together with two sets of approved plans and specifications. The survey should bear a current date (within 60 days prior to submission), northpoint, scale, contours, U.S.C. & G. [now National Geodetic Survey] benchmark datum, descriptions and elevation, etc., and the signature and seal of a land surveyor registered in the State of Louisiana. The detailed construction drawing can then be given approval. 
(6)  Construction of off-site improvements. The owner of the subdivision then has permission to install the offsite improvements. This approval is good for two years. If off-site improvements are not started within two years, approval becomes void. 
(a)  Project engineer notifies the city in writing of the name of the contractor performing the work and his starting date. The project engineer has the responsibility of visiting the job during construction to see that construction is being performed according to his plans and specifications and to render advice should any questions arise concerning his plans and specifications. 
(b)  The off-site improvements (streets, utilities, etc.) must be completed and accepted by the city prior to final approval or as per 4.302. 
(7)  Municipal numbers. Municipal numbers assigned by the building official must be placed on the tracing. 
(8)  Final approval. Prior to final approval all of the above must be complied with. 
Final approval can then be signed. 
Building permits can now be obtained and lots sold.

PART 1. - PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, AND JURISDICTION 

Section 1.1. - Purpose. 
    Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land has been cut into streets, lots, and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects. It is, therefore, to the interest of the public, the developer, and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived, designed, and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards. 
    These regulations have as their purpose these objectives through the application of procedures, standards, and requirements herein established. Specifically, these regulations are: 
(1)  To establish procedures governing the filing and approval of land subdivision plats and effective date in Slidell, Louisiana. 
(2)  To establish minimum standards governing streets, utilities, and other required improvements. 
(3)  To establish minimum standards governing the preparation and filing of land subdivision plats and data to be submitted to the Slidell planning commission for approval. 
(4)  To ensure the proper coordination of future streets and their development with existing or planned streets. 
(5)  To fix penalties for the violation of the provisions of these regulations. 
(6)  To provide that the Slidell planning commission may vary these regulations in certain cases or under certain conditions. 
Section 1.2. - Authority. 
    These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority granted by the provisions of Act 139 of 1956 and R.S. 33:101-33:119, as amended. The Slidell planning commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these statutes as prerequisite to the adoption of such regulations. Such laws prohibit the subdivision of land into more than two lots unless an accurate map, plan, and plat of such subdivision shall have been approved by the planning commission and shall have been certified and recorded in the office of the clerk of court of the parish. 
Section 1.3. - Title. 
    These regulations shall be known as the "Official Subdivision Regulations of the City of Slidell, Louisiana," and may be so cited. 
Section 1.4. - Jurisdiction. 
    1.401 Area of Control. 
    These regulations shall govern all subdivisions of land within the incorporated area of the City of Slidell, Louisiana. However, the provisions of these regulations shall not be applicable to plats of the subdivisions recorded as required by law and approved by the Slidell city council prior to the effective date of these regulations. 
    1.402 Plat required. 
    These regulations and development standards shall apply to the following forms of land subdivision: 
(1)  The division of land into two or more tracts, lots, sites, or parcels. 
(2)  The dedication, vacation or reservation of any public or private easement through any tract of land regardless of the area involved, including those for use by public and private utility companies. 
(3)  The dedication or vacation of any street or alley through any tract of land regardless of the area involved. 
(4), (5) Reserved. 
(Ord. No. 1308, 10-28-1980) 
Section 1.5. - Administration. 
    The Slidell planning commission upon approval of the mayor and council of Slidell, Louisiana, may employ any staff, person or persons, or consultants to assist in the administration and coordination of these regulations.

Figures referenced in this new article are on file and available for inspection in the office of the council clerk. 

Section 13.1 - Purpose and applicability. 
13.101 Purpose. This part is for the purpose of addressing the quality, sustainable design of buildings and building sites so as to preserve and enhance the visual character of the city. The standards of this part seek to provide for buildings constructed of quality, durable materials; building sites and developments that are functional, safe, and attractive; and a community character that conveys a positive, lasting impression on both residents and visitors. 
13.102 Application. 
A.  Generally. The standards of this part apply to new development, redevelopment, substantial improvement, and expansion of residential and nonresidential and mixed use buildings in all zoning districts, as described below. 
B.  Residential design standards. Single-family, two-family, and multifamily development whether allowed as a permitted, limited, or conditional use in districts E, AC.1, AC.21 AC.3, AC.4, A-1, A-2, or A-3 are subject to the standards set out in section 13.2, residential design standards, in addition to all other applicable standards of this UDC. 
C.  Nonresidential and mixed-use design standards. Nonresidential and mixed-use developments whether allowed as a permitted, limited, or conditional use, in districts PB, GC, MUC, PBC, or LI are subject to the standards set out in section 13.3, nonresidential and mixed-use design standards, in addition to all other applicable standards of this UDC. 
D.  Special district standards. Nonresidential and mixed-use developments whether allowed as a permitted, limited, or conditional use in districts NC or OT are subject to the standards set out in section 13.4, special district design standards, in addition to all other applicable standards of this UDC. 
(Ord. No. 3674, § 13.1, 3-12-2013) 
Sec. 13.2. - Residential design standards. 
13.201 Single-family and two-family standards. 
A.  Placement of buildings. The placement of a principal building in a perpendicular or sideways orientation on an interior or through lot is prohibited. See Figure 13.201, Building Placement. 
B.  Building entrances. All single-family residences and single building residential developments shall be designed such that a primary entrance and windows face a public street. 
C.  Maximum number of buildings per lot. There shall be a maximum of one principal building per single-family residential lot. 
D.  Windowless walls. Lot-line and patio variant lot line dwelling units shall not be designed with windows that provide views into the side yards of abutting property. However, windows may be permitted in walls designated as windowless, only if it is demonstrated that: 
1.  The adjoining land is a public right-of-way or servitude; 
2.  Windows are frosted or composed of glass block, do not open, are materially offset from windows of any type on adjoining property, and satisfy all applicable building code requirements; or 
3.  The adjoining land is commonly owned or public open space. 
13.202 Ground floor treatments for elevated residences. 
A.  Purpose. Design considerations for the treatment of elevated residences are important for the protection from flooding, but also for constructing residences that are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with the character of the neighborhood and community. The purpose of this section is to provide for well-designed elevated residences for which there is a smooth transition from ground to dwelling, with the foundation being integrated with or complementing the structure itself. This may be accomplished with structural and/or non-structural improvements depending on the height of the base floor of the structure. 
B.  Requirements. Residences that are elevated above grade, whether by columns, posts, piles, piers, pedestals, or extended foundation walls, shall enclose or substantially screen the structural members used to elevate the structure, as well as other ancillary improvements (e.g. areas used for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage). The means for enclosing or screening the foundation (i.e. the ground level beneath an elevated residence) are specified in this section. 
C.  Design principles. The most important consideration is to design an elevated foundation and its enclosure and/or screening in a manner that resists the forces caused by the base flood and the character of its flood waters. Foundations and their enclosures and/or screens that are built in these areas and under these flood conditions must be able to withstand the hydrostatic flood forces placed upon them, resist the impact of water-borne debris, and offer the minimum possible resistance to flow in order to reduce the dynamic forces without reducing the structural strength of the foundation. 
D.  Use of fill. The use of fill for elevating residences shall be in accordance with [division II,] section 4, filling and fine grading of the standard subdivision specifications [appendix B.1] and section 9.206, fill. 
E.  Full enclosure of foundation area. Fully enclosed foundation areas shall be in accordance with section 9.205, standards and requirements. 
F.  Required openings. Walls that enclose the foundation area shall contain openings to allow for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters during design flood conditions. These may be non-engineered or engineered openings, which shall meet the requirements of section 9.205, standards and requirements, as well as the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) report entitled, Flood resistant design and construction (ASCE 24-05). 
G.  Door openings above ground level. Door openings that were at ground level prior to elevation and are above ground level after elevation shall either be made accessible by way of a walkway connecting to the main stairs or by way of an independent landing and stairs. Door openings that are no longer passable by way of no access, including garage doors of pre-elevated residences, shall be permanently and structurally enclosed and finished to match the materials and color of the façade. The latter shall be visually undetectable upon completion. 
H.  Non-conversion agreement required. An applicant proposing to structurally enclose the ground floor of a structure in the floodplain with a finished floor of five feet or more above grade shall be recorded with the clerk of court, with a stamped copy returned to the engineering department prior to the certificate of completion/occupancy being issued. 
I.  Means of enclosure. The means of enclosing a foundation area may include structural and/or nonstructural improvements, as follows: 
1.  Structural enclosure improvements. Structural enclosure improvements include different types of wall systems that partially or fully enclose the foundation area. Walls used to form an enclosed foundation shall be designed so that they do not allow the pressure and velocity force of water and water-borne debris to load the structure excessively. Foundation systems shall be free of obstructions and attachments that will transfer flood forces to the structural system or that will restrict or eliminate free passage of flood waters during design flood conditions. Allowable structural improvements include: 
a.  Break-away walls that are designed to break away or fail under flood loads but remain attached to the residence or are of a weight that are designed to sink and thus, not create water-borne debris; 
b.  Detached walls that may be temporarily removed from the permanent structure and stored before a flood; 
c.  Hinged walls that are designed as hinged panels that may be swung out of the path of flood waters and debris; and 
d.  Louvered walls that are designed to allow water to pass through them, which are allowable only in locations or situations where no debris flow is expected. 
2.  Structural enclosure improvement design. All ground-level enclosures shall be designed to: 
a.  Allow flood waters to rise and flow freely under the structure; 
b.  Not permit the enclosure walls themselves to become water borne debris; and 
c.  Not cause the accumulation of water-borne debris. 
3.  Non-structural screening improvements. Non-structural screening improvements include finish materials attached or affixed to but not part of the foundation, which may include, but are not limited to, siding, veneer, or lattice panel systems, or other skirting materials. Landscaping may be used in addition to, and not in place of, non-structural screening improvements unless the elevation is less than or equal to 30 inches from the mean ground level. Allowable nonstructural improvements include: 
a.  Wood or cement siding with a maximum allowable exposure of lap siding of eight inches. Prohibited siding materials including External Insulating Finishing System ("EIFS"), metal or aluminum siding and trim, plasticized materials, and vinyl; 
b.  Veneer panel systems that are supported by a concealed or unconcealed border and horizontal and vertical framing with spacing of no more than 36 inches; 
c.  Wood or vinyl lattice panels that are supported by a concealed or unconcealed border and horizontal and vertical framing with spacing of no more than 36 inches; 
d.  Other skirting materials that are pre-approved by the director for use as a non-structural screening improvement, which may be forwarded by the director to the planning commission for their approval; 
e.  Applied trim materials consisting of stained or painted wood, vinyl, or other painted or tinted materials that exhibit wood-like properties. Metal, concrete block, poured concrete, and unfinished wood are prohibited; and 
f.  Landscaping adjacent to and within no more than 48 inches from the non-structural screening improvement. Where the elevation is less than or equal to 30 inches from the mean ground level, landscaping with a mature growth height of no less than 36 inches shall be planted in a continuous row along the elevations as set out in subsection (K) below. See Figure 13.202.2, Standards for Non-Structural Screening Improvements. 
J.  Design of structural and non-structural enclosures. Structural enclosure improvements and nonstructural screening improvements shall be integrated with or complementary to the principal structure. Such improvements shall: 
1.  Have an opacity of 100 percent, excluding windows, doors, and other required openings, for structural enclosure improvements;

The director may forward the proposed improvements to the planning commission for their approval. 
N.  Applicability. Structural enclosure improvements and non-structural screening improvements may be applied as set out in [subsection (J) above]. 
O.  Access to elevated residences. Passable door openings that are above ground level shall be made accessible, subject to subsection (G) above. One door shall serve as the primary opening with all other openings being secondary. The requirements of primary and secondary doors are as follows: 
1.  Primary door. 
a.  Landing. The primary door shall have a landing that is extended no less than four feet or more than six feet from the building façade and with a total area of no more than 48 square feet unless the landing joins a covered walkway that connects to a secondary door in which case it may exceed the maximum landing area. 
b.  Railing. The landing shall provide a railing in accordance with the building code. 
c.  Landing cover. A roof projection shall extend one foot in each direction beyond the outer perimeter of the landing to provide cover and protection from the elements. 
d.  Stairs. The stairs leading from the landing to the ground level shall be constructed parallel to the front building line. The stair case and stair treads shall be constructed within a maximum width of six feet from the building façade. Only in cases where there are inadequate dimensions to accommodate the building code required rise and run of stairs (e.g., inadequate lot width); where there are pre-existing, permanent obstructions; or where it is impractical to construct stairs (e.g. stairs terminating at or near a side property line making access impractical), the direction and/or dimensions of the landing and stairs may be modified provided the modifications are the minimum necessary to meet the building code and to practically accommodate the landing and stairs. Stairs that are perpendicular to the front building line and encroaching into the front setback shall be avoided if practicable. In instances of impracticality, applicants shall demonstrate maximum reasonable compliance with these standards. See Figure 13.202.2, Standards for Access to Elevated Residences. 
e.  Interior stairs. Where possible and practical, stairs shall be constructed within the foundation line, interior to the building envelope. See Figure 13.202.4, Illustration of Covered Walkway and Interior Stairs. 
f.  Stair cover. That portion of stairs that encroaches into a required setback shall not be covered, unless required by the building code or ADA accessibility standards. 
g.  Elevators and lifts. Whether required or not required to meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility requirements, elevators and lifts are permitted to serve elevated residences. Generally, the same dimensions that apply to stairs shall be applied to elevators and lifts. Similarly, in cases where there are inadequate dimensions to accommodate building code or ADA accessibility requirements or where there are impracticalities, the dimensions may be modified provided the modifications are the minimum necessary to meet the code requirements and to practically accommodate the elevator or lift and its mechanical systems, apparatus, and enclosures, as required. In instances of impracticality, applicants shall demonstrate maximum reasonable compliance with these standards. 
h.  Encroachment. Provided the residence is elevated directly above its original foundation line, the landing and stairs may encroach into the required front setback a distance of no more than six feet, excluding the one foot overhang of the roof projection over the landing. If the residence can be set back from the original foundation line while maintaining the same size and dimensions of the original residence and also while meeting all other required setbacks, it shall be set back to the maximum extent practicable to accommodate the landing and stairs with the minimum necessary encroachment into the required setback. An encroachment necessitated by elevation shall not require a variance provided demonstration to the director of the compliance with the standards and requirements of this section. See Figure 13.202.5, Allowable Encroachment. 
2.  Secondary door(s). Secondary doors are those that are in addition to the primary door, which may be on a front, side, or rear building elevation. Secondary doors shall either connect by way of a covered walkway to the landing and stairs of the primary door, have stairs to the ground level that are within the foundation line, or have stairs to the ground level that are along a side or rear elevation and without encroaching into the required setbacks. See Figure 13.202.4, Illustration of Covered Walkway and Interior Stairs. In cases where there is inadequate dimensions to accommodate building code requirements or where there is impracticalities, these requirements may be modified provided the modifications are the minimum necessary to meet the code requirements and to practically accommodate access to the secondary door. In instances of impracticality, applicants shall demonstrate to the director maximum reasonable compliance with these standards.

4.502. 
Sidewalk definitions. The following definitions are provided for sidewalk design: 
(1)  Curb: Raised or vertical element that provides any or all of the following purposes: drainage control, roadway edge delineation, right-of-way reduction, aesthetics, delineation of pedestrian walkways, reduction of maintenance operations, and assistance in orderly road side development. A sidewalk may contain the following elements 
(a)  Curb face: Side of the curb facing the roadway. 
(b)  Back of curb: The line that delineates the curb from adjoining planting zone or pedestrian zone. 
(c)  Barrier curb/vertical curb: Vertical or nearly vertical curb face intended to discourage vehicles from leaving the roadway. 
(d)  Mountable curb/sloping curb: Low flat sloping faces designed so vehicles can cross them readily when need arises. 
(2)  Planter Zone: Area between the back of curb and edge of pedestrian zone or bicycle zone where street trees, grass, shrubs, and any other vertical public infrastructure is placed. Minimum width of the planter zone is two feet. 
(3)  Bicycle zone: Area set aside for bicycles. Minimum width is five feet for one way bicycling; ten feet for two way bicycling. 
(4)  Pedestrian zone: Area set aside for pedestrians. Minimum width when there is a planter zone is five feet. Minimum width when there is not a planter zone is six feet. 
(5)  Frontage zone: Area between edge of the sidewalk and the line separating the public right-of-way from private property. Minimum width is one foot. 
(6)  Shared use path: A wide sidewalk intended for use by both pedestrians and bicycles. Minimum width is ten feet. 
4.503. 
Sidewalk design requirements. Figures 1 through 3 are the city's approved sidewalk designs. Figures 1 and 2 provide a choice for pedestrian only sidewalks. Figure 3 is for shared use paths. 
(1)  Pedestrian only sidewalks. The city has two approved pedestrian only sidewalk designs - Figures 1 and 2. The differences between the two designs are the presence or absence of a planter zone, the amount of standoff between the roadway and the pedestrian zone or bicycle zone, and curb types allowed. 
* Five foot is the minimum width of the pedestrian zone, because this is required width for wheelchair use (five foot is minimum diameter for a wheelchair to turn around). 
* When there is no planter zone the minimum pedestrian zone width is increased to a minimum of six feet. The additional foot is needed to separate pedestrians from vehicles using the adjacent roadway. 
* Barrier/vertical curbs are required when there is no separation between the roadway and the pedestrian zone or bicycle zone. When there is a planter zone the curb can be either barrier/vertical or mountable/sloped. 
* The planter zone must be a minimum of two feet in width to allow space for maintenance. 
(a)  Option 1: A minimum two foot Planter Zone, and a minimum five foot Pedestrian Zone (See Figure 1). 

(b)  Option 2: No Planter Zone, and a minimum six foot Pedestrian Zone. 

(2)  Shared use path. The shared use path is intended to accommodate both pedestrian and bicycles. The minimum width is ten feet broken into two five-foot wide lanes, one in each direction. The divider can be delineated by paint alone. If there is a raised surface its width must be added to the minimum ten-foot path width to accommodate wheel chair use. Raised surface is defined as any vertical change that would impede the free movement of a wheel chair. 

(3)  Other requirements. 
(a)  Sidewalks will be constructed of four-inch thick concrete. Additional technical specifications for constructing sidewalks are provided in Appendix B.1- Standard: Subdivision Regulations, Division II: Technical Provisions, 
* Section 1 - Streets; Paragraph 4.0 - Concrete Pavement 
* Section 3 - Concrete Driveways and Sidewalks 
(b)  Sidewalks will be free of obstruction. Where sidewalks must shift to avoid obstructions the shift will be gradual so that pedestrians and bicyclists have ample time to adjust. 
(c)  Sidewalk grade will not exceed 5.0 percent. 
(d)  Sidewalk cross slope will not exceed 2.0 percent. 
(e)  Whenever a sidewalk transitions to street level or a driveway crossing the connection will be smooth so as to not provide a trip hazard. 
(f)  Use Louisiana Department of Transportation standard plans for curb ramps, sidewalk pedestrian facilities, intersection layouts, and detectable warnings. 
(4)  Special designed sidewalks. City of Slidell will approve special designed sidewalks to accommodate unique location restrictions on a case-by-case basis. Examples of unique location restrictions include but are not limited to lack of sufficient public right-of-way, less than seven feet available from back of curb to property line, and other public infrastructure is obstructing the area available for sidewalks. Submit request, with design specifications, to the city planning department. The planning department will staff the request to the engineering department and public operations department. Based on the three departments' input, the plan will be approved, approved with modifications, or denied. The planning department will notify the owner/developer/contractor of the city's decision. 
(5)  Distances provided are minimums. City encourages developer/property owner/contractor to provide wider sidewalks when practical, especially in high pedestrian traffic areas.

PART 5. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL 

Section 5.1. - Preapplication consideration. 
    Whenever any subdivision of a tract of land is proposed to be made, the subdivider or his agent is encouraged to discuss the project with the Slidell planning commission prior to submitting the preliminary plat. 
Section 5.2. - Procedure for preliminary plat, detailed construction drawing, and final plat approval. 
5.201 
On reaching conclusions informally as recommended in section 5.1 above regarding his general program and objectives, the subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with improvements, plans, and other supplementary material specified in section 5.3. 
5.202 
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of three separate steps: 
(1)  The initial step is the preparation and submission to the Slidell planning commission of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision. 
(2)  The second step is submission of detailed construction drawings to the city engineer for approval. After approval by the city engineer, the subdivider either constructs the improvements with city engineering inspection, or posts a performance bond. 
(3)  The third step is the preparation and submission of the final plat together with required certificates to the Slidell planning commission. This final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the Clerk of Court, St. Tammany Parish, when duly signed by the chairman of the Slidell planning commission. 
Section 5.3. - Preliminary plat requirements. 
5.301 
At least 16 calendar days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered, the subdivider shall submit to the Slidell planning commission 12 copies of the preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision drawn to scale of one inch equals 100 feet or one inch equals 50 feet. The submitted plat must be accompanied by true copy of the recorded deed to the land to be acted upon. The commission's secretary shall provide each commission member with a photocopy of said deed and retain the true copy of said deed. 
5.302 
The preliminary plat which shall meet the minimum standards of design as set forth in part 3 of the general requirements for the construction of public improvements as set forth in part 4 shall give the following information insofar as possible: 
(1)  The proposed subdivision's name and location, the name and address(es) of the owner or owners and the name of the designer of the plat who shall be a competent engineer, landscape architect, city planner, or land surveyor. 
(2)  Date, approximate northpoint, and graphic scale. 
(3)  The location of existing and platted property lines, section and township lines, existing streets, buildings, watercourses, railroads, bridges, culverts, any public utility easements, both on this land subdivision and adjacent land, present zoning classification, if any, on the land to be subdivided and the adjoining land near the subdivision, and the names of adjoining subdivisions. 
(4)  Plans of proposed utility servitude layouts (sewer, water, and electricity) showing feasible connections, where possible, to existing and proposed utility systems. 
(5)  The proposed street names and locations, dimensions of proposed streets, alleys, easements, parks, and other open spaces, reservations, lots, and building setback lines. 
(6)  Contour intervals to sea level datum of not more than two feet when the slope is less than four percent. Show spot elevations of all breaks in grades along drainage channels or swales and at selected points not more than 200 feet apart in all directions for slopes less than two percent, and contour intervals of not more than five feet when the slope is greater than four percent. 
(7)  If any portion of the land being subdivided is below the elevation of flood as designated by the section 3.108, limits of such flood shall be shown. 
(8)  Typical cross sections of the proposed grading and roadways or sidewalks and topographic conditions drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet horizontal and one inch equals 20 feet vertical when required by the Slidell planning commission. 
(9)  The acreage of the land to be subdivided. 
(10)  Vicinity map showing location of subdivision site. 
(11)  The width and location of any street or other public ways or places shown on the master plan or major road plan within the area to be subdivided. 
(12)  All subdivision proposals greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, shall include base flood elevation data. "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
5.303 
The Slidell planning commission will review and indicate disapproval or tentative approval. The mayor will subsequently review and indicate tentative approval by signature. The mayor will have 14 days after receiving the decision of the planning commission to sign the plat. If the mayor disagrees with the decision of the planning commission, he shall state the reasons for disagreement in writing to the planning commission chairman within 14 days after receiving the plat from the commission. If the mayor does not sign the plat within the 14-day period specified above, it will automatically indicate the mayor's approval. 
5.304 
Four additional copies of the preliminary plat with any corrections required by the planning commission will be submitted for signatures. One copy will be provided to the city engineer, director of planning, building official, and the subdivider. The official copy of the Slidell planning commission will be maintained by the department of planning. 
5.305 
After tentative approval of the preliminary plat by the Slidell planning commission, the subdivider then prepares preliminary drawings of all improvements to be made in the subdivision in accordance with these regulations and to the standards of the City of Slidell, Louisiana, and shall submit these to the city engineer for tentative approval. 
5.306 
After tentative approval by both the Slidell planning commission, mayor and city engineer, the preliminary plat is approved. 
5.307 
The approval of the preliminary plat by the Slidell planning commission and mayor will not constitute acceptance of the final plat. 
5.308 
The approval of the preliminary plat shall lapse unless a final plat based thereon is submitted within two years from the date of such approval, unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Slidell planning commission.

(5)  Failure by the subdivider to pay the fee described in 5.507, paragraph 1, within 30 days after approval of the final plat, the subdivider having been duly notified of the approval, shall render the final plat null and void and the subdivider shall be so notified by the city department of planning by U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested. This action shall be so noted on the permanent record of the subdivision request. 
5.508 
If approval of the final plat is contingent upon an agreement to be effected after discussion between the subdivider and any department of the City of Slidell and such agreement is not reached or is not expected to be reached within the 30-day period required in subsection 5.507, the Slidell Planning Commission may, but does not have to, extend, once only, the final date on which the subdivider must pay the fee described in subsection 5.507 to avoid the final plat becoming null and void by not more than 30 days, upon a favorable vote on such action by a majority of the authorized membership of the commission in legal session convened.

PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL CITY OF SLIDELL, LOUISIANA 
Step Action Actor Procedure 1 Acquire engineering information Subdivider Subdivider shall prepare a sketch and location map of his proposed subdivision and review these with the city engineer. This shall be done in order to obtain preliminary information regarding the availability and adequacy of sewer and water facilities for his proposal. The city engineer is located at 2056 Second Street, Slidell, La., or may be contacted by calling (504) 646-4270. 2 Preapplication conference Subdivider Subdivider shall bring the sketch and location map of his proposed subdivision to a meeting of the planning commission. This shall be done in order to receive guidance as to what will probably be required of him before he has incurred great expense in making detailed plans. The planning commission normally meets on the third Monday of each month at 7:00 p.m. in Slidell City Hall. The subdivider shall contact the secretary of the planning commission (in city hall) prior to the meeting in order to be included on the agenda. 3 Prepare preliminary plat Subdivider Subdivider must prepare a "preliminary plat" as specified in section 5.302 of the subdivision regulations of Slidell. A copy of these regulations may be obtained from the city department of permits (for a small charge). The subdivider shall be sure to include all necessary information on the plat as specified in the subdivision regulations. 4 Present preliminary plat Subdivider Subdivider must submit the preliminary plat of his proposal before the planning commission for their review. The plat must be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission at least seven calendar days prior to the meeting at which it is to be first considered (six copies drawn at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet). The subdivider shall not necessarily expect the commission to take action at this first meeting since it will take time for the appropriate agencies to review the details of the proposal. The planning commission may require a public hearing to be held on the proposed subdivision. 5 Review of preliminary plat Planning 
commission The planning commission and other appropriate agencies and persons will review the preliminary plat to ensure that all provisions of city ordinances are met and that plans are consistent with good planning practice. 6 Tentative approval by planning commission Planning 
commission After reviewing the proposed subdivision, the planning commission may grant tentative approval of the plat. If approved subject to conditions, the nature of the required conditions will be indicated to the subdivider. If the plat is disapproved, reasons for such disapproval shall be given. "Tentative approval" does not constitute "approval" of the preliminary plat. 7 Prepare preliminary construction drawings Subdivider After receiving tentative approval from the planning commission, the subdivider must then prepare preliminary drawings of all improvements to be made in the subdivision (in accordance with the regulations and standards of the City of Slidell). 8 Submit preliminary construction drawings Subdivider The subdivider must submit the preliminary drawings for his proposed subdivision to the city engineer for review (see step 1 for location of city engineer). 9 Tentative approval by city engineer City engineer After reviewing the preliminary construction drawings, the city engineer may grant tentative approval to the plat. This tentative approval must be received by the subdivider in written form. 10 Approval of preliminary plat Planning 
commission After tentative approval by both the planning commission and city engineer, the chairman (or secretary) of the planning commission may then sign the preliminary plat granting approval. The approval of the preliminary plat will not constitute acceptance of the final plat. (Please note the time limit for final plat approval in section 5.308 of the subdivision regulations). 11 Prepare detailed construction drawings Subdivider After approval of preliminary plat, the subdivider must then prepare detailed construction drawings of all improvements to be made in the subdivision (in accordance with the regulations of the City of Slidell). These drawings must be submitted to the city engineer for review and approval. 12 Approval of detailed construction drawings City engineer After reviewing the detailed construction drawings, the city engineer may grant approval so that the subdivider can proceed with the installation of offsite improvements (or post a performance bond). This approval must be signed by the city engineer and a copy filed with the secretary of the planning commission. No improvements may be installed by the subdivider until such approval is granted. 13 Installation of improvements Subdivider After approval of the detailed construction drawings, the subdivider may proceed with installation of all improvements (or as per section 4.3 of the subdivision regulations). 14 Submit final plat Subdivider After all improvements have been installed (or a performance bond posted), the subdivider may submit a final plat to the planning commission for review and approval (see section 5.5 of subdivision regulations for final plat requirements). The final plat must be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission (at city hall) at least seven calendar days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. 15 Approval of final plat Planning 
commission After review of the final plat to ensure that it conforms substantially with the approved preliminary plat, the planning commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat within 60 days after its submission. Failure by the planning commission to act on this final plat within these 60 days shall be deemed approval of it. If the plat is disapproved, the grounds for disapproval shall be stated upon the records of the planning commission in writing. 16 Assignment of municipal numbers Building 
official After approval of the final plat, the building official shall assign municipal numbers to each lot (which shall be shown on the plat). 17 Distribution of final plat Subdivider After approval of final plat and assignment of municipal numbers, the subdivider shall distribute the final plat as per section 5.507 of the subdivision regulations. 18 Inspection of improvements City engineer The city engineer will inspect all improvements to ensure that they have been completed according to city standards. The city engineer will approve or disapprove the installed improvements in writing to the city council. 19 Acceptance of improvements City council After approval by the city engineer, the city council will accept for maintenance all improvements provided a one-year maintenance bond in an amount not less than ten percent of the total construction cost of said improvements has been posted. The improvements will be accepted by a resolution prepared by the city attorney.

4.5. 
Before placing concrete: 
4.5.01. Placing shall not be commenced until sufficient subgrade is prepared and forms set. Concrete shall be placed with minimum rehandling and in one layer. The concrete shall be sliced and spaded while being placed. Particular attention shall be given to vibrating adjacent to forms and joints. Over-vibration or manipulation causing segregation shall not be permitted. 
4.5.02. When forms have been securely set to grade, the base shall be tested as to cross section and elevations by means of template. The template shall be so constructed and operated to correctly indicate locations where the base does not conform the specified elevation and section. Low areas shall be brought to proper elevation by filling with approved material. Pavement shall not be placed on loose materials or a rutted base. 
4.5.03. The base shall be saturated with water the previous night or not less than six hours prior to the placing of concrete. If it subsequently becomes too dry, the subgrade shall be sprinkled, but the method of sprinkling shall not be such as to form mud or pools of water. 
4.5.04. Concrete shall not be placed on a frozen subgrade. No concrete shall be mixed while the air temperature is at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Concrete shall not be placed unless the air temperature is at least 40 degrees Fahrenheit and rising. No materials containing frost or lumps of hardened materials shall be used. No concrete shall be placed around manholes or other structures until they have been brought to the required grade and alignment. 
4.5.05. The roadway pavement shall be of the size and shape set forth in the plans including the integral curb, and consist of one course of Portland cement concrete with the addition of joints, dowels, etc., as called for in the plans. 
4.5.06. Form work. Forms shall be so constructed and placed as to resist, without springing or settlement, the pressures of the concrete. When set to grade and stakes in place, the maximum deviation of the top surface from a straight line shall not exceed one-eighth inch and one-fourth inch in ten feet for the up- standing leg. 
4.5.07. Forms shall be cleaned and oiled each time they are used. 
4.5.08. Site mixing. The mixing of concrete shall be done in a batch mixer of approved type and size which ensure a uniform distribution of the materials throughout the mass, so that the mixture is uniform and homogenous. The equipment at the mixing plant shall be so constructed that all materials (including the water, admixture of fine sand, if used) entering the drum can be accurately proportioned and be under control. The entire batch shall be discharged before recharging. The volume of the mixed material per batch shall not exceed the manufacturer's rated capacity of the mixer. The mixing of each batch shall continue for the periods indicated below during which time the drum shall rotate at a peripheral speed of about 200 feet per minute. The mixing periods shall be measured from the time when all of the materials are in the mixer drum. Mixing time shall be as set out in subsections 4.5.09 and 4.5.10 below. 
4.5.09. For mixers of a capacity of one cubic yard or less 11/2 minutes. 
4.5.10. For mixers of capacities larger than one cubic yard, the time of mixing shall be increased 15 seconds for each additional one-half cubic yard capacity or fraction thereof. 
4.5.11. The mixer shall be thoroughly checked and calibrated before beginning operations and during mixing operations or at any time deemed necessary by the engineer. Equipment not in good operating condition shall not be used. 
4.5.12. Central plant batching. Batching of materials in the desired proportions may be accomplished at a central plant when so approved by the engineer. When approved, the batching plant shall include batcher bins, either of the stationary or mobile types, with separate compartments for fine and coarse aggregates, each compartment designed to discharge freely and efficiently into the weighing hopper or hoppers. The scales for weighing aggregates shall be either the horizontal or the springless dial types, designed of rugged construction as an integral unit of the batching plant with a maximum allowable error of one-half percent of the net load and with significant gradation down to two pounds. The contractor shall maintain the equipment in good condition and adjustment and shall provide for accurate operation. If, for any reason, equipment previously approved becomes unsatisfactory, it shall be repaired or replaced before proceeding with the work. 
4.5.13. Aggregates shall be transmitted from the batching plant to the mixer in batch boxes, vehicle bodies or other containers of adequate capacity and construction to properly carry the volume required. Cement in original shipping packages may be transported on the top of the aggregates, each batch containing the number of bags required by the "job mix". Batches shall be delivered to the mixer separately and intact, and each batch container shall be dumped cleanly into the mixer without loss of cement or mixing or spilling of material. Bulk cement may be used if necessary precautions to prevent loss in transit are taken. All vehicles carrying loose cement must be covered during transit with tarpaulin. 
4.5.14. Mixing shall be accomplished as specified above for site mixing. 
4.5.15. Central plant mixing. The use of a central mixing plant will not be permitted unless specifically approved by the city in writing. When such approval is given the concrete shall be mixed to such consistency that the hauling will cause no segregation of the constituent materials. The method of storing and hauling and equipment used shall be subject to the approval of the city. Vehicles used to transport the mixed concrete shall be equipped with suitable devices for slowly agitating the concrete during transit and for delivery of the concrete in an unsegregated condition of uniform consistency. Any vehicle load showing nonuniform consistency on arrival will be subject to rejection. 
4.5.16. Transit mixing. Transit mixing will be permitted, provided that the requirements of ASTM specification C-94, latest edition are met. 
4.6. 
Placing concrete. Concrete shall not be placed until base has been conditioned as hereinabove specified. Base shall be moistened in advance of concreting, but shall not be muddy or excessively wet. The concrete shall be mixed in quantities required for immediate use and shall be deposited on the base to the required depth and width of the pavement section in successive batches and in a continuous operation without the use of intermediate forms or bulkheads between joints. While being placed, the concrete shall be spaded and compacted with suitable tools so that the formation of voids or honeycomb pockets is prevented. The concrete shall be especially well spaded and tamped against the forms and along all joints. 
4.6.01. Concrete will not be dropped onto the base from such a height as to damage forms. The bucket or chute will be as close to the base as possible when the concrete is released. 
4.6.02. At the end of a day's placement, or in the case of unavoidable interruption of more than a 30-minute period, a transverse joint shall be placed at the point of work stoppage; provided that the section on which the work has been suspended shall be not less than ten feet in length; sections less than ten feet in length shall be removed from the subgrade, and the removed concrete shall be disposed of from the job site. 
4.7. 
Working and finishing concrete. The sequence of operations shall be: First, "the strike-off and consolidation"; second, "longitudinal floating and removal of laitance"; followed by "straight edging," "belting" and final finish "brooming." All finishing equipment and tools shall be cleaned as often as required by the city. 
4.7.01. Strike-off and consolidation. The concrete shall be distributed or spread as soon as placed. A mechanical concrete spreader may be used. The concrete shall then be struck off and screeded by vibration or means approved by the engineer. The striking off and screeding shall conform to the existing crown and cross section determined before removal of the existing pavement and shall be performed at such elevation slightly above grade that, when properly consolidated and finished, the surface of the pavement will be at the original elevation and free from porous areas. 
4.7.02. Hand methods of strike-off and consolidation. Concrete, as soon as placed, shall be struck-off and screeded to the original crown and cross section determined before removal of the existing pavement and to such elevation above grade that when consolidated and finished, the surface of the pavement shall be at the grade elevation. A strike-off original template constructed to produce the pavement surface cross section indicated on the plans shall be provided for this work. It shall be rigidly constructed to retain its shape. In making the strike-off above mentioned, the template shall be moved always in the direction in which the work is progressing and so manipulated that neither end is raised from the side forms during the striking-off process. 
4.7.03. Longitudinal floating. After the concrete has been struck off and consolidated it shall be further smoothed and consolidated by means of a longitudinal float, using one of the following methods. 
4.7.04. Hand method. The hand-operated longitudinal float shall not be less than three feet in length and six inches in width, properly stiffened to prevent flexibility and warping. In this operation, a longitudinal float, operated from boot bridges resting on the side forms and spanning but not touching the concrete shall be worked with a sawing method motion, while held in a floating position parallel to the road centerline, and passing gradually from one side of the pavement to the other. Movement ahead along the centerline of the pavement shall be in successive advance of not more than one-half the length of the float. Any excessive water or soupy material shall be wasted over the side forms on each pass. 
4.7.05. Mechanical method. The mechanical longitudinal floats shall be of a design approved by the engineer, and shall be in good working condition. The tracks from which the float operates shall be accurately adjusted to the required crown. The float shall be accurately adjusted and coordinated with the adjustments of the transverse finishing machine so that a small amount of mortar is carried ahead of the float at all times. The forward speed shall be adjusted so that the float will lap the distance specified by the engineer on each transverse trip. The float shall pass over each area of pavement at least two times, but excessive operation over a given area will not be permitted. Any excess water or soupy material shall be wasted over the side forms on each pass. 
4.7.06. Brooming. As soon as the surplus water, if any, has risen to the surface, the pavement shall be given a broom finish. The broom shall be drawn from the center to each edge of the pavement with adjacent strokes slightly overlapping. The brooming operation shall be so executed that the corrugations produced in the surface will be uniform in appearance and not more than 1/16 of an inch in depth. Brooming shall be completed before the concrete is in such condition that the surface will be torn or unduly roughened by the operation. The surface thus finished shall be free from rough and porous area, irregularities and depressions, resulting from improper handling of the broom. Brooms shall be of the quality, size and construction and be so operated as to produce a surface finish meeting the approval of the engineer. Subject to satisfactory results and approval of the engineer, the contractor will be permitted to substitute mechanical brooming in lieu of the manual brooming as herein described. Brooms shall be maintained in good usable condition at all times by being washed thoroughly and dried at frequent intervals. Any course or long bristles which cause irregularities or deep corrugations shall be trimmed or entirely cut off. Brooms which have become worn or which are otherwise unsatisfactory for acceptable work shall be discarded. 
4.7.07. Edging. After brooming has been completed, but before the concrete has taken its initial set, the edges of the slab shall be carefully finished with an edger of the radius required by the plans, and the pavement edge shall be left smooth and true to line. 
4.8. 
Curing. Curing shall be by an approved moist curing method or by spraying with an approved curing compound. Materials and methods used shall retain, after 72 hours, at least 90 percent of the original water in the mix, when tested by ASTM C-156. Curing will follow immediately after brooming.

4.13. 
Inspection. 
4.13.01. Final inspection shall be made in accordance with the general conditions. The pavement shall be clean. 
4.13.02. Opening for traffic. The contractor has full responsibility for his pavement until it is accepted by the engineer. The contractor must place suitable barricades of sufficient size and weight to prevent easy removal, across all accesses to the unaccepted pavement. 
4.13.03. The use of unaccepted pavement by the contractor, any of his subcontractors, the public or the city before it conforms with the strength requirements of paragraph 4.13.04 below is prohibited without written permission of the city and the violation of same either through direct intent on the part of the contractor or by others due to the failure of the contractor to sufficiently prevent access, may prevent final acceptance by the engineer. 
4.13.04. The pavement can be opened to all traffic when the results of the 28-day cylinder tests show the concrete has the required strength. The pavement can be opened to light traffic when test results indicate 75 percent or 3,000 psi of the desired strength has been obtained and then only upon the permission of the engineer. 
4.13.05. The city reserves the right to open the pavement to traffic or to prohibit the opening to traffic at an age other than specified above, if, in the opinion of the city engineer, physical conditions warrant.

Expansion joints shall be provided where shown on standard plans or as may be otherwise directed and made in the following manner: Premoulded joint filler, one-half inch in thickness and of a depth of one-half inch less than the thickness of the driveway, shall be placed perpendicular to the surface. 
4.00. 
The subgrade on which the driveways are to rest, shall be thoroughly rolled or tamped so as to be uniformly compressed and solidified. The finished grade shall be smooth, even well sealed and exactly parallel to the finished surface of the driveway. 
5.00. 
Concrete sidewalks shall be constructed with the same materials, having the same compressive strength, placed and cured in the same manner as the concrete in the roadway slab. They shall be four feet in width and fixed at such elevations as may be specified on the plans or as directed by the engineer, and shall have a minimum thickness of four inches. 
6.00. 
In preparing the subgrade on which the concrete sidewalk will be placed, all soft and spongy places shall be removed and all depressions filled with suitable materials which shall be thoroughly compacted in layers not exceeding six inches in thickness. The subgrade shall be thoroughly tamped until it is brought to a firm unyielding surface. It shall have slope in conformity with the slope of the finished surface of the concrete sidewalk. 
7.00. 
After the concrete has been placed in accordance with paragraph 5.00 it will be brought to the established grade by means of a strike board, and it will then be worked with a wood float in a manner which will thoroughly compact it and provide a surface free from depressions or irregularities of any kind. Excessive working shall be avoided. In no case shall dry cement and sand be sprinkled on the surface. The surface edges of all slabs shall be rounded to a radius of one-half inch. 
8.00.

SECTION 5. - SEWER CONSTRUCTION 

1. - General and administrative requirements. 
1.1. 
Approval required. No sewer main or other collection works shall be installed in the City of Slidell, except in accordance with plans and specifications which have been approved by the city engineer. 
1.2. 
City obligations. Approval of the plans and specifications by the city engineer does not bind the city to perform any work, move or repair any facility, or provide traffic control or any other service. 
1.3. 
Guarantee. All sewer constructed by or for a developer and delivered to the city is required to be guaranteed by the developer against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of acceptance by the city. 
2. - General construction requirements, common to all sewer installation. 
2.1. 
Trenching. 
2.1.1. Trench width below the top of the pipe shall be limited to the outside diameter of the pipe, straight or sloping sides of greater width are permissible. 
2.1.2. Trench widths in excess of those allowed by paragraph 2.1.1 may be used only with the specific written approval of the city engineer. 
2.2. 
Dewatering. 
2.2.1. Sewers shall be installed in surface-dry trenches. Sump pumping (in impervious or slightly pervious soils) and well points (in pervious soils) will be used as necessary to achieve and maintain the surface-dry condition. Failure to eliminate standing water and to expose the trench bottom will be cause for rejections of the construction by the city. When joint materials or support materials require "curing", no water will be permitted in the trench until these materials have set. 
2.3. 
Sheeting and shoring. 
2.3.1. Sheeting which extends below 18 inches above the top of the pipe shall be left in place. 
2.3.2. Sheeting may be cut off at or above 18 inches above the top of the pipe and must be cut off at or below two feet below the finished grade. 
2.4. 
Bedding. 
2.4.1 As a minimum, bedding will conform to Class C, "shaped bottom" as shown on Page 212, ASCE Manual No. 37, 1969. Where the soil appears different from the typical soil of the project, especially if it appears inadequate for support, the unsuitable material will be removed and replaced with a clean well-compacted granular material and the bedding will conform to Class C, "granular bedding" as shown in the same manual on the same page. Where the city engineer or his authorized representative finds the original trench bottom soil to be "unsuitable," this determination is binding and requires use of the "granular bedding." 
2.4.2. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve the design engineer of responsibility for load analysis and bedding determination for the type of pipe selected, soil conditions, and applied loads. 
2.5. 
Pipe laying. 
2.5.1. All sewer lines shall be laid to lines and grades shown on plans approved by the city engineer. Bell and spigot pipe shall be installed with bell upgrade. Before being set in place, each length of pipe shall be thoroughly cleaned, free of earth, or foreign material. 
2.5.2. Each pipe shall be laid to form a close joint with the adjoining pipe sections having a continuous invert to the established line and grade. When sewer pipes are laid between manholes or other structures, a complete circle of light shall be visible from the pipe ends. 
2.5.3. Raising the sewer pipe to grade by ramming or tamping of earth and bedding material will not be permitted. Upon proper bedding of the pipe, the opening under its bell shall be properly filled in a manner such as not to disturb its position or joint. At points where work is temporarily suspended all open ends of pipe shall be securely sealed to prevent entrance of water, earth or other substances. 
2.6. 
Jacking and boring. 
2.6.1. Jacked or bored installations are permissible in general, however, the details of the operation require the approval of the city engineer. A drawing showing the guide or alignment apparatus, jacking equipment, and backstop together with the pipe manufacturer's document giving recommendations for this type of installation, will be submitted, together with any other information required by the city engineer. The field installation must also be approved by the city engineer before beginning operations. 
2.6.2. The city engineer's approval of the method and installation does not relieve the developer or contractor of responsibility for achieving the required line and grade. 
2.6.3. Jacking and boring may be used to install a lining, with the sewer main subsequently grouted in place, provided that the design has been approved in accordance with paragraph 1.1 and the installation is approved in accordance with paragraph 2.6.1 above. 
2.7. 
Wyes, tees and service connections. 
2.7.1. All wye branches, tees and other special fittings shall be installed at locations indicated on plans approved by the city engineer. Each wye shall be provided with a 45 degree bend properly connected to the branch. In cuts of eight feet or more, riser connections shall be provided with a tee having a six-inch branch in a vertical plane. A six-inch riser with double branch fitting set to proper elevation for service connections shall be constructed for the tee branch. Each connection will be recorded by marking its location at the curb. 
2.7.2. In unstable soils, the foundations for wyes and tees shall be a timber platform having vertically driven timbers to develop bearing for the masonry, the pipe fitting and the backfill. 
2.7.3. Service connection lines shall be installed from the sewer line branches or risers to the property line at a grade of not less than one-eighth inch per foot. Service connection lines will be a minimum of three inches in diameter, and be placed not more than 4.5 feet below finished grade. The line shall be true to line and grade, with all future connection openings being sealed tight against the entrance of water, earth or any other material until such time as the permanent connection at the property is made. Cleanout will be molded into 18? × 18? × 4? concrete slabs and clearly marked and shall be to sidewalk grade abutting sidewalk on property side. 
2.8. 
Manholes. 
2.8.1. Manholes shall be constructed at locations shown on the plans. An approved cast iron frame and cover shall be provided and installed with the top of the cover flush with the finished grade or at another elevation specified on the plans. 
2.8.2. Manholes for sewers less than 24 inches in diameter will have concrete interior bottoms and will be watertight for the full height. In general, all lines joining the manhole will enter at the bottom. Bottoms will have U-shaped channels of width and depth at least equal to the incoming lines leading to outgoing lines. Where a change in direction occurs, the lines should be brought in off-center as necessary to provide the largest possible radius to the curved channel, which is done by placing the ends of the outer channel side on opposite ends of a manhole diameter. The remaining area of the bottom will be shaped as a flat bench having a slope of one-half inch per foot towards a channel. 
2.8.3. Where pipe entry at the general elevation of the bottom cannot be achieved, the following requirements apply: 
2.8.3.1. If the pipe invert is less than 24 inches above the outfall invert, no drop inlet is required, but a channel in the manhole bottom is required. The channel will have dimensions as though the pipe entered at the bottom. 
2.8.3.2. If the pipe invert is more than 24 inches above the outfall invert, a drop inlet is required. Where a drop inlet is required, an interior drop as shown in Figure 33 (right side) of ASCE Manual 37(1969) is preferred. 
2.8.4. Manholes for sewers over 24 inches in diameter must be detailed on the plans and approved by the city engineer. 
2.8.5. No steps will be installed in manholes. 
2.9. 
Backfilling. 
2.9.1. When the trench is backfilled with soil from the original excavation, the soil must be hand-placed and compacted to 90 percent of maximum standard Proctor density to a level 12 inches above the pipe. Special care must be taken to ensure placement and compaction beneath the pipe haunches and around the sides of the pipe. Soil will be placed in lifts not more than six inches thick before compaction. 
2.9.2. Where select materials are to be used for the backfill, the material properties and proposed placement specification will be submitted to the city engineer for approval. 
2.9.3. All material used for backfill will be free of roots, timber, trash or other deleterious material. Excess soil will be mounded as necessary to prevent a depression from forming due to subsequent consolidation (paragraph 2.10 governs). 
2.9.4. Trench sections under roadways and driveways will be backfilled in six-inch uncompacted thickness lifts, compacted to 90 percent of maximum standard Proctor density to the surface or subgrade for pavement structure construction. 
2.10. 
Site restoration. 
2.10.1. In general, all surfaces damaged will be restored to a condition equivalent to that existing before the work began, including areas near, but not on, the sewer alignment and areas damaged by traffic rerouted by the contractor (or as a result of his operations). 
2.10.2. Earth surfaces will be restored to original grade or slightly mounded, with no obstruction to drainage or hazard to any person. 
2.10.3. Shell surfaces shall be restored with salvaged material or shell of the same type as the original surfacing after the backfill has been thoroughly consolidated over the trench. The replaced surfacing shall be smooth and free of foreign material. 
2.10.4. Concrete or asphalt surfacing will be replaced by similar construction of sound design and good workmanship as appropriate for the usage, regardless of the quality of the work removed. City ordinances and standard specifications will be followed in the design and construction, both of which must be approved by the city engineer. 
2.10.5. All other public works in the way of the construction will be left unharmed or replaced by similar construction of sound design and workmanship.

4.2. 
Testing. All sewers constructed for city acceptance will be tested by the developer or contractor under the supervision of the city engineer as follows: 
4.2.1. Infiltration-exfiltration test. Where the groundwater table is more than four feet above the average invert of the sewer being tested, or less than four feet below the average ground surface, an infiltration test will be conducted. Where the groundwater table is not within the limits above, an exfiltration test will be conducted. Use of the alternative test or both tests may be required by the city engineer to demonstrate satisfactory performance for acceptance. 
4.2.1.1. Infiltration tests. The developer or contractor shall provide and install a V-notched wire at the outlet end of the section under test. Alternative measuring devices may be used with the approval of the city engineer. The measuring devices may be used with the approval of the city engineer. The inlet end of the section under test shall be plugged watertight. The test shall continue for at least four hours with accurate logs of flow information kept for the full period. Both the average flow for the test period and any flow rate observed for more than one hour total time during the test must not exceed 500 gallons per inch of sewer pipe diameter per mile of sewer per day. 
4.2.1.2. Exfiltration tests. The developer or contractor will plug the ends of the section under test tight. The sewer will then be filled with water to a level four feet above the highest point of sewer invert or four feet above the average groundwater table, whichever is higher, or to the bottom of the manhole cover frame. After a reasonable time for absorption in masonry and joints, the test shall commence. Water will be added to maintain a constant level in the sewer. The added water shall be accurately measured. The test shall continue for at least four hours with accurate logs of water addition being kept for the full test period. The average water addition required to maintain a constant level must not exceed 600 gallons per inch of sewer pipe diameter per mile of sewer per day. 
4.2.1.3. Where the infiltration or exfiltration exceeds the established limits, the sewer will not be accepted by the city until remedial measures have been taken and the results of subsequent tests are within the established limits. 
4.2.2. Television inspection. In addition to the infiltration and exfiltration testing, the sewer will be examined by the city's sewer television truck. Any significant defects of any nature observed by the television technician will be required to be repaired and reinspected. Breaks, separations, improper lateral connections, and deviation from proper grade resulting in standing water are examples of defects found by this method.

CHAPTER 8. - ZONING ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS 

8.1 - Procedure. 
    In accordance with part 8, section 8.1 of the City of Slidell Zoning Ordinance, no amendment, supplement or change of the zoning ordinance or district map shall become effective unless and until the zoning commission has submitted its report and recommendations to the city council, the city council has held a public hearing, and a final yea and nay vote has been taken on the proposal by the city council within 120 days dated from the introduction of an ordinance in correct form. 
8.2 - Methods of expediting. 
    In order to expedite this process, the council administrator will convert each proposal for amendment, supplement, or change of the zoning ordinance or district map into correct ordinance form, upon receipt of the zoning commission's recommendations, and enter it on the consent calendar as introduced "by request" by the president of the council, and seconded "by request" by the councilmember whose district is affected; or, if it affects more than one district, as seconded "by request" by the councilmember-at-large receiving the most votes when elected. If the councilmember-at-large receiving the most votes when elected is the president of the council, the other councilmember-at-large will be indicated as seconding "by request" the introduction of the ordinance. 
CHAPTER 9. - VOTING BOARD RULES AND PROCEDURES 
(a)  Councilmembers in legal session convened shall use the electric call vote. 
(b)  When a question item has been discussed and the council, by at least a majority, has indicated (according to Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised) they are ready to vote, the president or chairman shall announce: "Roll call vote". The chairman will allow adequate time for the members to vote. 
(c)  The chairman shall then instruct the council administrator to record the vote. The council administrator shall throw the master board switch. This action will simultaneously record the vote. Those votes not lit shall not be considered. If the council administrator notices a member has thrown two switches in error, he shall call this to that member's attention prior to flipping the switch to the master board. In the event of malfunction of the electrical board, no votes shall be recorded. The president or chairman will ask for another vote by verbal or roll call.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is Ordinance No. 2941, as adopted by the city council on Apr. 25, 2000. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform, and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. Provisions were set out in the ordinance as Appendix D.2B. For the purpose of continuity, and with the concurrence of the city, provisions were set out as Appendix E. 

PART 1. - PURPOSE AND INTENT 
    The purpose and intent of this appendix is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and visitors of the City of Slidell by ensuring the provision of safe and adequate roadway facilities. The provisions of this appendix establish requirements for transportation studies that provide information on traffic projected to be generated by proposed developments. It is the further intent of this appendix to establish requirements for the identification of any potential traffic operational problems or concerns, as well as potential solutions to such problems or concerns. 
PART 2. - WHEN REQUIRED 
    A traffic impact analysis shall be required for each development when the following traffic peak hour trips are exceeded. 
1.  If the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual indicates that the proposed development shall generate an equal or a less amount of traffic than the existing development, then no traffic impact analysis shall be required. 
2.  If the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual indicates that the proposed development shall generate more traffic than 50 peak hour trips, then the following shall apply: 
A.  Limited traffic impact analysis. If the proposed development shall generate greater than 50 and less than 150 peak hour trips, either in AM or PM, the developer shall submit a limited traffic impact analysis which shall include the following: 
(1)  The proposed trip generation and distribution. 
(2)  The source of the information submitted, for example the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual. If a source other than the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual is used, then a comparison between the source used and the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual shall be submitted. 
(3)  An analysis of the ingress and egress of the development in relation to the level of service on the adjacent roadway system. 
(4)  The study shall include recommendations for any roadway or intersection improvements to maintain the existing level of service. 
(5)  An analysis of the roadway capacity, whether existing or proposed, on all roadway links abutting the proposed development site and identification of roadway and/or intersection improvements necessary in order to maintain the existing level of service. 
(6)  An analysis of the capacity and of the level of service of the nearest signalized intersection in each direction from the major entrances into the development. 
B.  Comprehensive traffic impact analysis. If the proposed development shall generate greater than one hundred fifty (150) peak hour trips, either AM or PM, the developer shall submit a Comprehensive Traffic Impact Analysis which shall include the following: 
(1)  All requirements of A (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) above. 
(2)  Graphs, maps and charts showing how the traffic shall be distributed onto the existing transportation network within a minimum of one-half mile of the proposed development, and an analysis of the capacity and of the level of service of each roadway link and intersection within this area for both existing and proposed conditions. 
(3)  Recommendations as to how any deficiencies determined by the analysis shall be resolved, including signalization and roadway geometrics. 
PART 3. - PROCEDURES 
    Pre-Approval of the Study Firm: 
    Prior to submission of the traffic impact analysis to the planning department and to the engineering department, the developer shall submit the qualifications of the planner and of the engineer that shall perform the traffic impact analysis to the planning department and to the engineering department for their approval. The principal in charge of the traffic impact analysis shall, at a minimum, be a licensed engineer with a specialization in traffic study, or shall be a licensed engineer with a specialization in traffic engineering, and shall have at least five years of experience in traffic engineering, or, shall be a planner with an American Institute of Certified Planners certification and shall have at least five years of experience in transportation planning. 
PART 4. - SUBMISSION OF TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
    No traffic impact analysis shall be accepted by the planning department or by the engineering department unless a proposal of the traffic impact analysis, an outline of the proposed traffic impact analysis, and the required professional qualifications are first presented to the planning department and the engineering department for their review and approval. 
PART 5. - TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS CONTENTS AND FORMAT 
    A traffic impact analysis shall contain, but not be limited to, the following: 
1.  A map of the specific study area. 
2.  Existing land uses within 500 feet of the proposed development from any point of contact with the property line. 
3.  Trip generation. 
4.  Trip distribution: one year, two year, three year traffic assignments. 
5.  Capacity analysis on adjacent and integral roadways. 
6.  Accident incident data within one-half mile of site. 
7.  Traffic assignments and capacity analysis. 
8.  Existing data on signalization affecting the site, including geometrics of the signal, type signal, and any other pertinent data that shall affect the upgrading of the signals. 
9.  Recommendations and findings. 
PART 6. - FINAL APPROVAL 
    The approval of the Director of Planning and of the City Engineer of the traffic impact analysis shall be required prior to final approval of the development and prior to the issuance of building permits. 
PART 7. - ACTIONS BASED ON TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 
    When a proposed development which is subject to the traffic impact analysis requirements of this appendix demonstrates that the proposed development shall overburden the roadway system or cause a reduction in service of affected roadway below the adopted level of service, an applicant may be required by the planning department and the engineering department to modify the development proposal to minimize the identified traffic related impacts. Modifications to applications for a development may include, but shall not be limited to: 
1.  A reduction in the projected vehicle trips per day; 
2.  Dedication of additional rights of way; 
3.  Rerouting of traffic and proposed access points serving the proposed project, subdivision or development; or 
4.  Participation in funding transportation off-site facilities, including signals and intersection improvements deemed necessary by the traffic impact analysis. 
5.  Other actions deemed necessary as demonstrated by the traffic impact analysis and deemed appropriate by the planning department or by the engineering department. 
PART 8. - CONFLICTS REPEALED 
    All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
