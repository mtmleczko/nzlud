Nothing in this charter shall be construed as exempting any individual or agency from the operation of this section. 
(Referendum 4-11-67) 
402 - - ORDINANCE PROCEDURE. 
    402.1 - When Required. In addition to such acts of the council as are required by this charter or by law to be by ordinance, every act of the council establishing a fine or other penalty shall be by ordinance. The acting clause of all ordinances shall be "THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF NEWARK HEREBY ORDAINS." 
    402.2 - Enacting Procedure. Every ordinance shall be introduced in writing. No ordinance shall be passed unless it shall have had at least one reading at a previous meeting. After passage on first reading, notice shall be published in at least one paper of general circulation in the City of Newark, at least ten (10) days prior to the established hearing date, stating the time and place where said ordinance will be given public hearing and be considered for final passage. At the time of the stated meeting and public hearing, the proposed ordinance shall be read in full or abstract and considered for passage. After the public hearing and consideration, the council may finally pass the proposed ordinance, or a substitute version thereof which is substantially similar thereto. Amendments of existing ordinances making substantive changes, and ordinances enacted to repeal existing ordinances, are subject to the same procedural requirements as herein prescribed for the enactment of a new ordinance. 
    402.3 - Emergency Ordinances. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public peace, the council may adopt emergency ordinances, but such ordinances may not levy taxes, grant, renew or extend a franchise, regulate the rate charged by the city for any of its utilities, or authorize the borrowing of money, except as provided in Section 804 hereof. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least five (5) members of council shall be required for adoption. After its adoption, the ordinance shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify; but every emergency ordinance, including any amendments made therein after its adoption, shall automatically stand repealed as of the sixty-first day following the date on which it was adopted, unless extended by regular ordinance action by council, and it shall be the duty of the city secretary to so notify the council. 
    402.4 - Codes of Technical Regulations. The council may adopt any standard code of technical regulations by reference thereto in an adopting ordinance. The procedure and requirements governing such an adopting ordinance shall be as prescribed for ordinances generally, except that a copy of each adopted code of technical regulations as well as of the adopting ordinance shall be authenticated and recorded by the city secretary pursuant to the requirements of the next section. 
    402.5 - Authentication and Codification. The city secretary shall authenticate by his signature and record in full a properly indexed book kept for the purpose, all ordinances and resolutions adopted by the council. 
    At least every ten (10) years the council shall provide for the preparation of a codification of all city ordinances and resolutions having the force of law. The codification shall be adopted by the council by ordinance and shall be published promptly, together with this charter and any amendments thereto. 
403 - - INVESTIGATIONS. 
    The council may make investigations into the affairs of the city and the conduct of any city department, office or agency, and for this purpose, may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony and require the production of pertinent evidence of any kind. Any person who fails or refuses to obey a lawful order issued in the exercise of these powers by the council shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be punishable by a fine or by imprisonment, or both. 
404 - - POWER TO RAISE REVENUE. 
    The council shall have the power to levy and collect taxes on real property within the city, except that which is not assessable and taxable by virtue of any law of the State of Delaware, which shall not be more than two (2) per cent of the assessed valuation of the assessable and taxable real estate within the city in any year clear of all delinquencies and expenses of collection; provided, however, in addition thereto, the council shall have the power to levy the taxes necessary to service the bonded indebtedness of the city. 
    The council shall have the right to grant or refuse, and to charge fees for licenses or permits for traveling shows and other businesses of any description within the city and to control their use of any property within the city. 
    The council shall have the power to levy and collect franchise fees and to impose sewer rentals on sanitary sewers. 
    The council shall have the power by ordinance to allow discounts for early payment of taxes, to impose reasonable penalties and forfeitures for tax delinquencies, and to review and determine proper and appropriate properties to be exempt from taxation. The council shall have the power by ordinance to exempt from taxation not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) of assessed value of real property of persons over sixty-five (65) years of age whose income does not exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per annum, as defined by ordinance. 
    The council shall have the power to fix the rates for utilities operated by the city and to collect and utilize revenues from such utilities for the benefit of the city. 
    The council shall have the right to levy and collect taxes upon all gas mains, water lines and telephone, telegraph power poles or other erections of like character erected within the limits of the City of Newark, together with the wires, cables and appliances thereto or thereon attached, as well as such wires, cables and appliances which may be installed underground, and to this end may, at any time, direct the same to be included in or added to the city assessment. In case the owner or lessee of such poles or erections and such wires, cables and appliances shall refuse or neglect to pay the taxes that may be levied thereon, the said taxes may be collected as in the case of other taxes. 
    The council shall have the right to impose a lodging tax of no more than 3 percent of the rent, in addition to the amount imposed by the State, for any room or rooms in a hotel, motel or tourist home, as defined in §6101 of Title 30, which is located within the boundaries of the City Newark. 
(55 Del. Laws, Ch. 289; 56 Del. Laws, Ch. 242; HB 435, § 2, 7-1-18) 
405 - - THE CITY MAY ENGAGE IN BUSINESS. 
    The city shall have the right to engage in any business or enterprise in which a person, firm or corporation might engage by virtue of a franchise, and shall have the right and power to acquire, own and maintain, within or without the corporate limits of the city, all real estate for municipal purposes, for sites and rights-of-ways for public utility and general welfare purposes, and for the location, erection and maintenance thereon of municipal utility plants and public facilities. 
    The city shall have the right to acquire the properties and rights of utility companies, and further shall have, if it wishes to so exercise, the exclusive right to provide water, sewer and electrical utility service within the corporate limits of the city as they presently exist or shall in the future be extended by annexation; provided, however, that in acquiring such utility properties, whether by purchase, condemnation or other means, the city shall, in all respects, adhere to the general laws of the State of Delaware; and provided further that nothing in this section shall authorize the acquisition by the city of any through electric transmission lines. 
    The city may, in its discretion, distribute water throughout all that territory included within ten (10) miles of the city limits. The council shall determine the person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations, to which the city shall distribute water throughout said territory; shall fix the rates therefor, shall regulate the use of said water, and shall supply the same upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the council and said person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations. The city shall have and exercise all the powers and authority necessary to the accomplishment of said distribution of water throughout said territory as it now has and possesses in the installation, operation and maintenance of its water system in the city and in the distribution by it of water within the city limits, including the authority and power to acquire by purchase or condemnation such land, and real and personal property as may be necessary therefor. 
406 - - BORROWING FOR CURRENT EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. 
    Whenever the needs of the city shall require more money than is, at the time, in the city treasury from current receipts, the council may, and it is hereby authorized and empowered, to anticipate current revenue by borrowing such amounts as are needed; provided, however, the amount of such indebtedness shall not at any time exceed one per cent of the assessed valuation of the assessable and taxable real property within the limits of the city. 
    Whenever the city shall require money for the construction or installation of sewers, paving, or other municipal improvements, the cost of which is assessable directly to the owners of property to be benefited by such construction or installation, the council shall be authorized and empowered to anticipate the receipt of such assessments by borrowing such amounts as are needed; provided, however, the amount of such indebtedness shall not at any time exceed the sum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00). 
    The council shall be authorized to take whatever action is necessary to obtain an appeal bond as may be required for the appeal of a court judgment, including obtaining security for such appeal bond such as through the securing of a letter of credit. The city's obligation to reimburse any amount drawn under a letter of credit shall constitute a general obligation of the city secured by the full faith, credit and taxing power of the city. 
    To exercise the power aforesaid, the council shall adopt an ordinance to that effect by the affirmative vote of five (5) of the members of council. The indebtedness created under this provision shall be evidenced by notes or bonds of the city, and the full faith and credit of the city shall be deemed to be pledged thereby. The short-term debt authorized hereinabove shall not be considered as part of the bonded debt of the city when limitations under indebtedness, as set forth elsewhere in this charter, are computed. The debt authorized for the payment of unfunded court judgments, and any debt incurred with respect to securing an appeal bond shall be considered as part of the bonded debt of the city when limitations under indebtedness, as set forth elsewhere in this charter, are computed.

    If revenue bonds are issued, each such bond shall recite in substance that said bond, including interest thereon, is payable from the revenue pledged to the payment thereof, and that said bond does not constitute a debt of the City of Newark within the meaning of the bonded indebtedness limitation; provided, however, that in the event of some emergency, the city may temporarily borrow, advance or loan such amount as is necessary to meet current interest on outstanding bonds, such advance or loan to be repaid to the city out of revenue subsequently received from the undertaking. If revenue bonds are issued, the council shall prescribe and have collected reasonable rates, fees or charges for the service, facilities and accommodations of said undertaking and shall revise such rates, fees or charges from time to time whenever necessary so that such undertaking shall be and always remain self-supporting. The rates, fees or charges prescribed shall be such as will procure revenue at least sufficient to pay, when due, all bonds and interest thereon, for the payment of which such revenue is or shall have been pledged, charged or otherwise encumbered, including reserves therefor, and to provide for all expenses of operation and maintenance of such undertaking, payments in lieu of taxes, depreciation and other reserves.

The bonds may be sold by competitive or negotiated sale. The council shall provide, in the budget, for revenues sufficient to pay the interest and principal on said bonds or certificates at the maturity or maturities thereof.

(a)  The alderman shall have jurisdiction of all violations of ordinances of the city and shall have power and authority to hold for bail, fine or imprison offenders, compel the attendance of those accused of any violation of city ordinances by service of process either within or without the limits of the city and compel the attendance of witnesses. 
(b)  The alderman may hold in contempt of court any person who by disorderly conduct interrupts any judicial proceeding or who refuses or fails to carry out a judgment, order, or decree rendered by the court and may punish the contempt by a fine of not more than $100.00 or by imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or both. 
(c)  The alderman may, if the facts warrant and instead of imposing the penalty prescribed, or any part thereof, place any person adjudged guilty of violating any ordinance of the City of Newark on probation to keep such reasonable terms and conditions which the court deems proper. Failure to keep such terms of probation may be deemed contempt of court and may be punished as such. 
(d)  For a violation or misdemeanor offense under Chapters 5, 7, 14, 17, 19, 20 (except for offenses under Section 20-57), 20A, 21, 22, 24, 31 or 32 of the city, the alderman after accepting a guilty plea or nolo contendere plea may stay the entry of judgment, defer further proceedings, and place the defendant on "Probation-Before-Judgment" subject to such reasonable terms and conditions as may be appropriate. When the pending offense is a criminal charge, prior misdemeanor convictions within five years of the date of the commission of the pending offense will render the defendant ineligible for probation before judgment. When the pending offense is a traffic charge, prior traffic convictions within five years of the date of the commission of the pending offense will render the defendant ineligible for probation before judgment. Prior parking violations do not render a defendant ineligible for probation before judgment. The terms and conditions of any Probation Before Judgment shall include the following requirements: 1) The defendant shall provide the court with his or her current address; 2) The defendant shall promptly provide the court with written notice of any change of address; and 3) The defendant shall appear if summoned at any hearing convened for the purpose of determining whether the defendant has violated or fulfilled any terms and conditions of Probation Before Judgment. The terms and conditions may include any or all of the following: 
(1)  Ordering the defendant to pay a pecuniary penalty; 
(2)  Ordering the defendant to pay court costs to the city; 
(3)  Ordering the defendant to pay restitution; 
(4)  Ordering the defendant to perform community service; 
(5)  Ordering the defendant to refrain from contact with certain persons; 
(6)  Ordering the defendant to conduct himself or herself in a specified manner; and 
(7)  Requiring the defendant to avoid arrest for a criminal offense during a specified time period. If the alderman requires as a condition of probation before judgment the avoidance of arrest for a criminal offense, the defendant's arrest during the specified time period will extend the probationary term until disposition of the new charge(s). A conviction or plea of guilty or no-contest on the new charge(s) will result in entry of judgment as set forth in subsection (d)(7)b. below. Dismissal of the new charge(s) or a finding of not guilty will result in discharge from probation as set forth in (d)(7)c. below. 
a.  This section may not be substituted for the First-Offender's Program under Section 20-57. 
b.  Upon a violation of a term or condition of the Alderman's Order of Probation before judgment, the alderman may enter judgment and proceed with disposition of the person as if the person had not been placed on Probation-Before-Judgment. 
c.  Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of Probation-Before-Judgment, the alderman shall discharge a person from probation and dismiss the offense. The discharge is a final disposition of the matter. Discharge of a person under this section shall be without judgment of conviction and is not a conviction for purposes of any disqualification or disability imposed by law because of conviction of a crime. 
d.  This section shall not be available to any person who has previously been admitted to Probation Before Judgment for any offense within five years of the current offense. 
e.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, no person shall be admitted to Probation Before Judgment if (1) a person is currently serving a sentence of incarceration, probation, parole, or early release of any type imposed for another offense, or (2) the person is charged with an offense and has previously been convicted of any violent felony or, (3) the person is charged with any offense and has previously been convicted of any nonviolent felony within ten years of the date of the commission of the alleged offense, (4) the person is charged with any offense and has previously been convicted of any misdemeanor offense within five years of the date of the commission of the alleged offense, or (5) the person is charged with an offense involving a motor vehicle and holds a commercial drivers license (CDL). 
f.  For the purposes of this section, the following shall also constitute a previous conviction: a conviction under the laws of another state, the United States or any territory of the United States of any offense which is the same as, or equivalent to, any offense specified in paragraph (d) of this section; or an adjudication of delinquency, or any adjudication, resolution, disposition, or program set forth in 21 Del.

"This quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that posses integrity of location, design, setting materials, workmanship, felling and association, and: 
i)  That are associated with an event that has made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or, 
ii)  That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;

The planning commission and city council may also consider in reviewing the above criteria, if a building or property is of particular local historic, cultural, and architectural significance, and is one of the few remaining Newark examples of a past architectural style or a structural representative of its era, whose demolition or deterioration would constitute an irreplaceable loss to the quality and character of the Newark community. 
3.  Criteria for evaluation for removal from the listing of historic properties. The planning commission's consideration and city council's removal of historic building and/or site designation shall be based on the property no longer meeting the criteria for evaluation for listing as historic property in subsection (e) of this section, resulting from the alteration or damage to the structure to such an extent that the special and distinguishing architectural character that had lead to its original listing has been greatly diminished or destroyed.

Sec. 11-4.1. - Computation of revenue stabilization adjustment clause. 
    The following provisions, hereinafter called the revenue stabilization adjustment (RSA) clause, apply where it is so stated in the rates set forth in the tariff. Component I of the revenue stabilization adjustment factor to a customer for a given period shall be determined by the following formulas: 
RSA (per kwh) = (C - B) x L       L = P/S   
    In the above formulas: 
(1)  "C" is the expected per-kWh cost of wholesale power purchases for the upcoming billing period as estimated by the finance department. 
(2)  "B" is the per-kWh base cost of purchased power and is equal to 9.33¢/kwh. 
(3)  "L" is the loss and city use factor which shall be adjusted periodically according to line losses and metered city usage. 
(4)  "S" is the expected kWh to be consumed by all customers assigned to service rate classifications subject to the RSA during upcoming billing period as estimated by the finance department. 
(5)  "P" is the expected sum of the kWh to be purchased for the upcoming billing period as estimated by the finance department. 
(6)  "kWh" is kilowatt hour(s). 
    Component II. Notwithstanding the preceding formula, the city reserves the right to increase or decrease the RSA factor derived from the preceding formula, at the sole discretion of the electric utility, if it is necessary to maintain the budgeted operating margin and budgeted capital requirements of the electric utility. Changes to the budgeted operating margins and budgeted capital requirements require council approval. 
    Component III. In addition, over- or under-collections experienced in the previous billing period may be factored into the calculation of the total RSA. Such increases or decreases to the RSA shall only be applied prospectively from the date of implementation.

1)  The initial term of this Agreement is for _______, commencing on _______. At the conclusion of said initial term of years, the Agreement, and all of its terms and conditions, shall continue in effect for successive terms of _____ years unless terminated by either Party giving notice of termination in writing to the other, such notice to be given at least three months prior to the date of termination of the initial term or any extension thereof. 
2)  During the term of this Agreement and any extensions thereof, Newark agrees to sell and provide to Electric Customer, who agrees to purchase from Newark in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, all of its requirements for electric energy. 
3)  The electric energy furnished Electric Customer shall be delivered by Newark at such delivery points and voltage levels as the Parties may mutually agree upon. 
4)  During the term of this Agreement and any extensions thereof, Newark shall bill Electric Customer for such electric energy monthly on or about the fifth day of each month at the rates set forth in Appendix A, attached hereto and made a part hereof, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Such monthly bills shall be due upon receipt. Finance charges of 1.5% per month shall be added to unpaid balances 21 days after the billing date. Service may be interrupted if balances remain after 51-53 days, subject to Newark's billing schedule. 
5)  Newark agrees that it will not, during the term of this Agreement or any extension thereof, increase or change the demand and energy charges applicable and which are set forth in Appendix A hereto, except as follows: 
(a)  Whenever the wholesale rates for electric energy which Newark is required to pay any other power supplier under their tariff(s) or contract(s) filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or any other authority having jurisdiction over Newark's wholesale power rates, should increase or decrease, the rates charged hereunder shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided.

Sec. 13-55. - Municipal services evaluation. 
(a)  The municipal services evaluation assigns a numeric value-the license fee ratio-to commercial and industrial classes in Newark to represent an estimate of the cost to provide, and the demand for, municipal services assignable to business in the city. 
The license fee ratio, therefore, provides a basis upon which to establish license fees which correspond to an estimate of the relative cost and demand for services for classes of businesses. In general, the municipal services evaluation methodology for establishing the license fee ratio is as follows: 
(1)  Each general service category is evaluated for the municipal service demand relationship to the commercial/industrial class by city departments or, in the case of street maintenance and police (traffic-control and parking enforcement), is evaluated based upon national averages of daily automobile trip rates for types of businesses (derived from the standard source for such rates; Maricopa Association of Governments, "Trip Generation by Land Use: The Summary of Studies Conducted, "Maricopa County, Arizona, 1974); in the case of fire service, the service demand is evaluated based upon information provided by the Delaware State Fire Marshal ("Delaware Fire Incident Reporting System, 1980 Fixed Property Use Classification"). 
(2)  Each general service category is assigned a portion (percent) of the total budget allocated to each service, less utilities and refuse collection, and apportioned to the industrial and commercial sector based upon aggregate assessed value of the sector. 
(3)  General service categories XII through XX relate to the sale and consumption of alcohol. City license fee ratios are based upon the extraordinary costs and demands for municipal services generated by these businesses and their patrons, especially regarding the administration and implementation of the relevant sections of Chapter 22, Police Offenses, Chapter 32, Zoning, and Chapter 7, Building. Rates established herein shall be known as the Alcohol Beverage Control Rates. The revenues generated thereby shall be used for the administration and implementation as described above and established as the City's Alcohol Beverage Control Program. 
(b)  The license fee ratio produced by the municipal services evaluation for each commercial and industrial class is as follows: 
Class

(Ord. No. 96-11, Amend. No. 1, 8-12-96) 
Sec. 13-121. - Tax reductions for historic properties. 
    All owners of taxable properties listed in Section 7-16(c) of this code shall be entitled to an annual 20% reduction in the city taxes due for such properties. 
(Ord. No. 96-11, Amend. No. 1, 8-12-96) 
Sec. 13-122. - Voluntary tax credits for preservation, restoration, and/or rehabilitation of historic residentially zoned properties. 
    Owners of residentially zoned properties listed in Section 7-16(c) of this code, may be entitled to tax credits for preservation, restoration, and/or rehabilitation of the exterior architectural facades of their buildings, subject to the following special procedures and requirements: 
(a)  Tax credits shall be applicable only for exterior architectural facade improvements to property defined as preservation, rehabilitation, and/or restoration in Section 7-16(b) of this code. 
(b)  Tax credits shall not be applicable to those property owners requiring certificates of economic hardship for demolition of their property, as defined in Section 7-16(b) of this code. 
(c)  Tax credits shall be provided at 50% of the total cost of the approved preservation, restoration, and/or rehabilitation up to a maximum credit of $10,000.00 (with a total project cost maximum of $20,000.00). The cost of the project must be at least $2,000.00, resulting in a minimum tax credit for the project of $1,000.00. 
(d)  No single property owner shall be eligible for in excess of $1,000.00 in tax credits in a single tax year regardless of the number of historic properties owned by such owner that are eligible for tax credits under this code. Nor shall any single property owner be eligible for in excess of $10,000.00 in tax credits for any ten-year period regardless of the number of historic properties owned by such owner which are eligible for tax credits under this code. 
(e)  Tax credits shall run with the property during their ten-year time period. 
(f)  Tax credits shall be prorated over the ten-year period. For example, a $10,000.00 credit shall be applied in $1,000.00 increments each year toward a property owner's city real estate tax. If the credit is less than the annual tax due on a property, the owner shall pay the difference to the city through the real estate billing process. If the credit is more than the annual tax due on a property, the owner's credit shall be deemed to be equivalent to the annual tax due. 
(g)  Tax credits shall be reviewed and approved as follows: 
(1)  Applicants shall submit a letter requesting a tax credit with a building permit application to the building department. 
(2)  Tax credit request submittals shall include the type and number of plans and specifications required for a building permit and, in addition, plans and specifications showing the impact of the proposed work on the exterior architectural facade of the building, as defined in Section 7-16(b) of this code. 
(3)  Tax credit request submittals shall include current color photographs of the property showing the present condition, accurately representing the existing materials and texture. All photographs shall be labelled indicating direction of view. 
(4)  Other information may be required by the building department to facilitate review of such tax credit submittals. 
(5)  The building and planning departments shall review the submitted plans, specifications, and related information for compliance with the United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings. These departments may consult with the Historic Preservation Technical Advisory Committee established in Section 7-16(1) of this code to assist in the review of tax credit request submittals. 
(6)  The building and planning departments shall issue a written statement approving, approving with conditions, or disapproving the tax credit request. The finance department shall be notified concerning approval of tax credits. Applicants shall have the right to appeal a tax credit disapproval to city council. 
(7)  The finance director shall apply approved tax credits during the fiscal year subsequent to the issuance of approval by the planning and building departments following the submittals to the code enforcement division by the applicant of the contractor's final invoice to verify the cost of the repairs to the building and following certification from the code enforcement division that the work has been completed in accordance with the approved building permit application.

Secs. 13-123-13-129. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE XI. - UNIVERSAL UTILITY PROVISIONS 

Sec. 13-130. - Purpose. 
    This article is intended to set forth the programs and procedures that are germane to all utility service revenue generating activities of the city. 
(Ord. No. 14-18, Amend. No. 2, 6-23-14) 
Sec. 13-131. - Budget billing. 
(a)  Budget billing. Any residential utility service or fee, or combination of utility services and fees, billed on a monthly basis may be paid in equal monthly installments. Residential customers must enroll in the city's pre-authorized payment ("PAP") program in order to enroll in the budget billing service. 
(b)  Method of estimating monthly installments. If the city has at least 12 months of historical utility usage data related to the property or utility account requesting budget billing, the city shall estimate the monthly installment based on 12 months of historical utility usage data. If the city has less than 12 months of historical utility usage data ("limited usage history") related to the property or utility account requesting budget billing, the city may estimate the monthly installment using a combination of limited usage history and the city's experience or research of similar properties. Once the usage has been estimated, the monthly installment shall be calculated based on the city's then-current utility rates, plus a margin not to exceed ten percent. 
(c)  Period covered. Once a customer has enrolled in budget billing, the customer must remain in the budget billing program for a minimum of 12 months ("budget billing cycle"). 
(d)  Settlement period. Upon completion of the budget billing cycle, the city shall reconcile and settle any difference between the utility charges accrued and the installment payments made. If the customer's cumulative installment payments during the budget billing cycle exceed the utility charges accrued during the same period, then the customer may elect (1) to accept a cash refund, (2) to accept a credit on the utility account enrolled in the previous budget billing cycle (for customers that do not reenroll in budget billing), or (3) to accept a credit on the utility account enrolled in the previous budget billing cycle to be applied prospectively over the course of the next immediate budget billing cycle (for customers that reenroll in the next immediate budget billing cycle). 
    If the customer's utility charges accrued during the budget billing cycle exceed the cumulative installment payments during the same period (an "underage" exists), the customer shall automatically make a payment via the PAP service at the time the 12th monthly installment is ordinarily due. The city shall provide the customer with at least one billing cycle notice of the amount of the 12th installment payment. Upon such notice, the customer may elect (1) to apply the underage prospectively to the next immediate budget billing cycle to be prorated over the next 12 months (for customers that reenroll in the next immediate budget billing cycle), or (2) to request a payment arrangement to satisfy the underage over a term not to exceed six months. Such payment arrangement request shall be approved by the finance director or his/her designee. 
    The city reserves the right to schedule interim settlement periods if the difference between the utility charges accrued during a portion of the budget billing cycle and the cumulative installment payments made over the same portion of the budget billing cycle grow to an amount equal to or greater than one budget billing installment payment. The city may adjust the installment payment during the course of a budget billing cycle in the event such an interim settlement is required. The city shall provide the customer with at least one billing cycle notice of any adjustment to the installment payment. The city reserves the right to establish one consolidated settlement period for all billing cycles. 
(e)  Delinquent payments. Failure to remit monthly installment payments in full by the due date may result in discontinuation of the ability to participate in budget billing. Delinquent payments shall accrue interest at a monthly rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent or the maximum amount permitted by law. The city shall apply partial payments to the electric component of the bill first, and any remainder shall be applied to non-electric components of the bill equally. Delinquent electric payments shall be treated in accordance with section 11-14 of this Code. Delinquent water payments shall be treated in accordance with section 30-36 of this Code. Delinquent sanitary sewer payments shall be treated in accordance with section 25-25 of this Code. 
(f)  Eligibility. Only residential utility customers are eligible for the budget billing program. Property taxes, realty transfer taxes, assessments, business license fees, permit fees, and all other non-utility fees are not eligible for the budget billing program. Residential utility customers with more than one utility disconnection for non-payment in the last 12 months, or any combination of more than one returned utility payment and more than two delinquent payments may not qualify for budget billing. Budget billing may be suspended by the city in the event that a customer enrolled in budget billing is delinquent more than once during a budget billing cycle or if the utility service of a customer enrolled in budget billing is disconnected for non-payment once during a budget billing cycle. In the event of such budget billing suspension, the city shall undertake an interim settlement period as described in subsection (d) herein.

Any unpaid fines, penalties, and fees imposed by any court for violation of this chapter shall be added to the property tax billings for the property that was the subject of the violation.

ARTICLE XIII. - LODGING TAX

(b)  The lodging tax is imposed on the occupant and shall be collected by the operator of the hotel, motel or tourist home from the occupant at the time of the payment of the rent for the occupancy. 
(c)  The amount of the tax collected for each month shall be reported and remitted to the finance department within the City of Newark within 20 days after the end of the calendar month. 
(d)  No lodging tax pursuant to this section shall be imposed for reservations or contracts for lodging that were paid in full prior to December 1, 2018. 
(e)  Late penalty. All lodging taxes unpaid after the prescribed due date shall incur an interest charge of 11/2% per month. Upon written notice and supporting documentation, the director of finance is hereby authorized to abate late payment penalty as necessary. 
(f)  Determination. If any operator fails to pay any lodging tax for which he or she is liable, the City of Newark may determine the additional tax and penalty due by such person or entity, based upon any information within its possession or that shall come into its possession. All determinations shall be made so that notice thereof shall be mailed to the person or entity against whom the determination was made within three years after the due date the lodging tax became due. 
(1)  Copy of determination to person; petition of redetermination; duty for disposition of petitions; notice of final decision. Promptly after the date of such determination, the City of Newark shall send, by certified mail to the physical address of the operator, a copy thereof to the person or entity against whom such determination was made. Within 90 days thereafter, the operator may file with the City of Newark a petition for redetermination of such taxes. The petitioner shall state with specificity the reasons the petitioner believes justify redetermination and shall affirm under penalty of perjury that the petition for redetermination is not made for the purpose of delay and that the facts set forth therein are true. The director of finance shall make a final decision within six months after the date of receipt of the petition and promptly provide written notice thereof to the petitioner.

CHAPTER 14A - FLOODPLAINS 
ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 14A-1. - Findings. 
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified special flood hazard areas within the boundaries of the City of Newark, Delaware ("city"). Special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundations which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Development that is inadequately elevated, improperly floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also contributes to the flood loss. 
    The city, by resolution, agreed to meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and was accepted for participation in the program on March 29, 1974. Subsequent to that date or the initial effective date of the City of Newark Flood Insurance Rate Map, all development and new construction as defined herein, are to be compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations in effect at the time of constructions, and all development, new construction, and substantial improvements subsequent to the effective date of those regulations shall be compliant with these regulations and, as applicable, the flood load and flood-resistant construction provisions of the building code, including specific amendments adopted by the city. 
(Ord. No. 15-02, Amend. No. 7, 1-12-15) 
Sec. 14A-2. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purposed of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to: 
(a)  Protect human life, health and welfare; 
(b)  Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent of minimize flood damage in the future; 
(c)  Minimize flooding of water supply and sanitary sewage disposal systems; 
(d)  Maintain natural drainage; 
(e)  Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units and its residents, by discouraging unwise design and construction of development in areas subject to flooding; 
(f)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(g)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(h)  Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges; 
(i)  Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazard areas should assume responsibility for their actions; 
(j)  Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near flood prone areas; 
(k)  Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the floodplain are maintained; 
(l)  Minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(m)  Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and 
(n)  Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 C.F.R. Section 59.22. 
(Ord. No. 15-02, Amend. No. 7, 1-12-15)

(Ord. No. 15-02, Amend. No. 7, 1-12-15) 
Sec. 14A-4. - Basis for establishing special flood hazard areas. 
    For the purposes of these regulations, and for the purpose of establishing flood hazard area in the building code section 1612.3 and the residential code Table R301.2(1), the following are adopted by reference as a part of these regulations and serve as the basis for establishing special flood hazard areas: 
(a)  The FEMA Flood Insurance Study for New Castle County, Delaware and Incorporated Areas dated February 4, 2015 and all subsequent amendments and/or the most recent revision thereof. 
(b)  The FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map for New Castle County, Delaware and Incorporated Areas dated February 4, 2015 and all subsequent amendments and/or the most recent revision thereof. 
(c)  Other hydrologic and hydraulic engineering studies and/or maps prepared pursuant to these regulations or for other purposes if approved by city council, and which establish base flood elevations, delineate 100-year floodplains, floodways or other areas of special flood hazard. 
(d)  The city may identify and regulate new local flood hazard or ponding areas. These areas should be delineated and adopted on a "local flood hazard map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies. 
(e)  Where field surveyed topography indicates that ground elevations are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a flood hazard map, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area. 
    Maps and studies that establish special flood hazard areas are on file at the planning and development department in the Newark Municipal Building, Newark, Delaware. 
(Ord. No. 15-02, Amend. No. 7, 1-12-15; Ord. No. 16-05, Amend. No. 1, 1-25-16) 
Sec. 14A-5. - Abrogation and greater restrictions.

(b)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; 
(c)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes; and 
(d)  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence, where more restrictive. 
(Ord. No. 15-02, Amend. No. 7, 1-12-15) 
Sec. 14A-7. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard areas or uses that are permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 15-02, Amend. No. 7, 1-12-15) 
Sec. 14A-8. - Severability. 
    Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. 15-02, Amend. No. 7, 1-12-15)

The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement, but excluding any unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for vehicle parking, building access or limited storage provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation requirements specified in the building code for enclosures below the lowest floor. 
(aa)  Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
(bb)  New construction. Buildings and structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after March 29, 1974, including any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
(cc)  Person. An individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and agencies. 
(dd)  Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
(ee)  Special flood hazard area. The land in the floodplain subject flood hazards and shown on a flood insurance rate map as Zones A, AE, AO, and Zone VE. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically listed or otherwise described in section 14A-4. 
(ff)  Start of construction. The date of issuance of permits for new construction and substantial improvements to existing structures, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of issuance. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, installation of pilings, or construction of columns. Permanent construction does not include land preparation (such as clearing, grading and filling), the installation of streets or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations, the erection of temporary forms or the installation of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a substantial improvement, the actual "start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(gg)  Structure (or building ). That which is built or constructed. 
(hh)  Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
(ii)  Substantial improvement. Any repair, alteration, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before improvement or repair is started as determined through assessment records or by a bona fide property appraiser to be submitted to the planning and development department. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
(jj)  Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in these regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time that documentation is provided.

(a)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.

(5)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws. 
(6)  A determination that the structure or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages. 
(7)  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

Representatives and/or agents and/or designees of the city may be requested to execute a non-disclosure agreement prior to the provision by Comcast of certain confidential information provided such representatives and/or agents are permitted to do so under applicable law. Information and documentation marked by Comcast as proprietary or confidential shall include a brief written explanation as to its proprietary nature or confidentiality subject to review by the city. The city and its officially designated representatives agree in advance to treat any such information or records which Comcast reasonably deems would provide an unfair advantage for Comcast's competitors (e.g., system design maps, engineering plans, programming contracts, etc.) as confidential so long as permitted to do so under applicable law and only to disclose it to city employees, agents, or representatives who have a need to know or in order to enforce the provisions of this agreement. In the event a request is made by an individual or entity not an employee, agent or representative of the city acting in their official capacity for information related to the franchise and marked by Comcast as confidential and/or proprietary, the city shall notify Comcast of such request. Comcast shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act, or information which is not relevant to regulation of the franchise (e.g., employee files, tax returns, etc.) 
(b)  Right to conduct compliance review. Not more than once every 36 months during the term of this agreement, the city or its representatives may conduct a full compliance review with respect to whether Comcast has complied with the material terms and conditions of this agreement so long as it provides Comcast with 30 days written notice in advance of the commencement of any such review or public hearing. Such notice shall specifically reference the section(s) or subsection(s) of the agreement that is (are) under review, so that Comcast may organize the necessary records and documents for appropriate review by the city. The period for any such review shall be for not more than 36 months immediately previous to the notice. The city shall promptly inform Comcast of any non-compliance issues that result from the compliance review or shall promptly issue an affirmative letter as to Comcast's compliance with the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement. Comcast shall not be required to disclose information in violation with Section 15-35(a) herein above. 
(c)  Reserved authority. The city reserves the regulatory authority arising from the Cable Act and any other applicable federal or state laws or regulations. Nothing in this agreement shall remove, restrict or reduce the city's authority, rights and privileges it now holds, or which hereafter may be conferred upon it, including any right to exercise its police powers in the regulation and control of the use of the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  Police powers. Comcast's rights under this agreement are subject to the police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general laws and regulations necessary for the safety and welfare of the public. Such laws and regulations are separate and distinct from the terms and conditions contained in this agreement. 
(e)  No limitation on taxing or fee authority. Nothing in this section or in this agreement shall be construed to limit the authority of the city to impose any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability in accordance with Section 622 (h) of the Cable Act. Such taxes, fees or assessments shall be in addition to franchise fees. 
(f)  Permits. Comcast shall apply to the city for all generally-applicable required permits and shall not undertake any activities in the public rights-of-way subject to a permit without receipt of such permit, the issuance of which shall not be unreasonably withheld by the city. Comcast shall pay any and all required permit fees.

(2)  Annual financial reports. Within 30 days of a written request, Comcast shall submit to the city its current financial statement, including a statement of income, balance sheet and a statement of sources and applications of funds which shall be verified by Comcast's Chief Financial Officer in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

(3)  Government reports. Comcast shall provide to the city, upon written request, copies of any and all communications, reports, documents, pleadings and notifications of any kind which Comcast has submitted to any federal, state or local regulatory agencies if such documents relate specifically to Comcast's cable system within the city.

(Ord. No. 17-33, Amend. No. 6, 10-9-17) 
Sec. 15-36. - Compensation to the city. 
(a)  Franchise fees. Comcast shall pay to the city an amount equal to five% of the gross revenues derived from the operation of its cable system to provide cable service in the city. Comcast shall not deduct or otherwise credit against the franchise fee any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability. The city may amend the franchise fee upon written notice to Comcast provided that the franchise fee may not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by law. A copy of the resolution or ordinance authorizing the franchise fee rate adjustment by the city shall accompany such written notice. Any change in Comcast's franchise fee obligation contained herein shall commence within 90 days from such written notice. 
(b)  Quarterly payments. Franchise fee payments to the city under this provision shall be computed at the end of each calendar quarter. Such payments shall be made within 45 days following the end of each of the first three calendar quarters and 60 days after the fourth calendar quarter. Specifically, payments shall be due and payable on or before May 15 (for the first quarter), August 15 (for the second quarter), November 15 (for the third quarter), and March 1 (for the fourth quarter). In the event that any franchise fee payment is not made on or before the date by which it is due, then interest calculated at an annual rate of six%, shall be added to the amount of franchise fee revenue due to the city. The interest rate shall be applied as described from the date such franchise fee payment was originally due. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable under this agreement. Upon request and if mutually agreeable, Comcast shall deposit the franchise fee payments electronically into an account as designated by the city. 
(c)  Quarterly reports. Within 10 days of each franchise fee payment described in Section 15-36(b) above, Comcast shall provide a written report containing an accurate statement of Comcast's gross revenues received for cable services for each calendar quarter in connection with the operation of Comcast's cable system and showing the basis for the computation of fees. Specifically, the report shall contain line items for sources of revenue received and the amount of revenue received from each source. The report shall be verified by a financial representative of Comcast. 
(d)  Franchise fee audit. Not more than once every three years and upon 30 days prior written notice, the city shall have the right to conduct a franchise fee audit or review of Comcast's records reasonably related to the sources, amounts and computation of gross revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Any such franchise fee audit or review shall occur within 60 months from the date the city receives such payment, after which period any such payment shall be considered final. Within 30 days of a written request, Comcast shall provide the city with copies of financial records related to the franchise fee audit or review. 
(1)  In the event of an alleged underpayment, the city shall provide Comcast with a written statement indicating the basis for the alleged underpayment. If the franchise fee audit or review reveals that there have been no underpayments, the city shall provide written notice to Comcast indicating that no underpayments were found and that the franchise fee audit is closed. Comcast shall have 30 days from the receipt of the statement regarding an alleged underpayment to provide the city with any written objection to the results of the franchise fee review, including any substantiating documentation. Based on this exchange of information, the city shall make a final determination of the underpayment(s), if any, within 30 days of Comcast's objection and shall provide Comcast with written notice of the determination. If Comcast disputes the city's final determination, it may submit the dispute to mediation or arbitration within 30 days of receiving the city's written notice of determination in accordance with the state arbitration law [Title 10 §5801, et seq.]. If Comcast submits the matter to mediation and an agreement is not reached, either party may bring an action to have the dispute determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that Comcast fails to submit the matter to mediation or arbitration within the required time period, the city's final determination shall be binding on Comcast. If Comcast submits the matter to mediation and an agreement is not reached, either party may bring an action to have the dispute determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(2)  Any franchise fee payment due to the city as a result of the franchise fee review shall be paid to the city by Comcast within 60 days from the date the city notifies Comcast of its final determination, or if the matter is submitted to mediation or litigation, within 60 days from the final disposition of such action. If the franchise fee review shows that franchise fees have been underpaid, then Comcast shall pay the underpaid amount plus monetary fines of ten% of the underpayment. If franchise fees have been underpaid by five% or more, then Comcast shall also pay up to $3,000.00 of documented out-of-pocket costs of the franchise fee review or audit. Any entity employed by the municipality that performs an audit or franchise fee review shall not be permitted to be compensated on a success based formula, e.g. payment based upon underpayment of fees, if any. 
(e)  Bundled services. If cable services subject to the franchise fee required under this section are provided to subscribers in conjunction with non-cable services and the total cost of the bundle reflects a discount from the aggregate retail prices of the services contained therein, then the franchise fee shall be applied to the retail price of the cable services in the bundle reduced by no more than a proportionate share of the overall discount. Equipment may be allocated at full retail price. 
(Ord. No. 17-33, Amend. No. 7, 10-9-17) 
Sec. 15-37. - Services to the community. 
(a)  Courtesy services to municipal facilities. 
(1)  Upon written request, Comcast shall, at no charge to the city, provide one complimentary standard installation and complimentary basic cable services (or equivalent) as described herein below to all present and future public facilities provided such facilities are regularly staffed by employees and not leased to third party entities, including, but not limited to, the following: city hall, police stations, fire companies, public works buildings, municipal owned and operated community facilities, water and sewer authorities, all public and private school buildings and public libraries ("permitted free locations"). 
(2)  Within three months of the effective date and upon request, Comcast shall provide or maintain one standard cable drop, outlet, converter box (and any other required end user equipment) and basic cable services (or equivalent level) package to each permitted free location. No charge shall be made for standard installation, except that Comcast may charge for installation beyond 150 feet from the active signal cable plant, service or equipment for more than three digital terminal adapters, or for more than one drop in each permitted free location. 
(3)  For the purposes of this section, the term "school" means an educational institution that receives funding pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq., as amended, and does not include "home schools" or "cyber schools," or any other educational situation that does not meet the specific criteria set forth herein. 
(4)  During the term of this agreement, new public facilities shall be eligible to receive such complimentary service to the extent that they meet the qualifications as set forth herein above as permitted free locations. 
(b)  Educational and governmental (EG) channel. 
(1)  Comcast shall continue to provide to the city, the use of one dedicated Educational and Governmental ("EG") Access Channel in accordance with Section 611 of the Cable Act. Such EG Channel shall be used for community programming related to educational and/or governmental activities. Such programming shall be non-commercial, except that it may include sponsorships in accordance with applicable law and regulations. As such, the city may obtain PBS-type sponsorship or underwriting for EG Access Channel programming and may identify such sponsors and/or underwriters with video and/or audio recognition that is value-neutral in describing a product line or service; provides location and contact information; and/or with logograms or slogans identify, but not promote or provide superlative descriptions or qualitative claims about products or services. The city shall have complete control over the content, scheduling, administration and all other programming aspects of the EG Channel, and may delegate such functions, or a portion of such functions, to an appropriate designee. Comcast shall not exercise editorial control over any EG Channel programming, except Comcast may refuse to transmit any program or portion of any program that contains obscenity pursuant to applicable law. Comcast shall cablecast the activated EG Channel so that it may be received by all Comcast subscribers in the city. 
(2)  To enable the city to utilize the EG Channel, Comcast shall continue to maintain the cables, wires, lines, and other signal distribution equipment capable of transmitting video and audio between the one city-selected video origination location and the Comcast cable system, such that live or recorded programming can originate from this selected location and be distributed via the cable system to subscribers in the city. These cables, wires, lines, and other signal distribution equipment shall be collectively known as the "return line." 
(3)  Comcast shall be responsible for maintaining the return line to the video origination point of the EG Channel so long as the city provides Comcast with access to such location and access to the EG Channel equipment within such location. Comcast shall provide, install and maintain in good working order the equipment and the cable necessary for transmitting the signal to the channel aggregation site for further processing and distribution to subscribers. Comcast shall maintain the EG Channel in accordance with the same FCC technical specifications that are comparable to the specifications used to maintain commercial channels transmitted to subscribers on the cable system, except that it shall not be responsible for the technical signal quality of programming produced by any EG channel programmer. 
(4)  The city or its designee shall be responsible for providing any necessary production or playback transmission equipment and shall be responsible for securing and supervising any trained/qualified personnel who conduct the operation of the EG channel. The city and Comcast agree to work cooperatively in implementing the EG channel through such means and in such manner as shall be mutually satisfactory. 
(5)  Fallow channel. In the event the city or its designee does not program any EG Channel, Comcast may request the use of this channel subject to written approval by the city. If the city approves Comcast's use of an EG Channel and, subsequent to such approval, the city requests the utilization of the EG Channel being programmed by Comcast, Comcast shall relinquish such use no later than 60 days after receipt of written notification from the city that it requires such channel for educational and/or governmental use. 
(6)  Any expenditure made in connection with the construction and maintenance of the return line shall be at the expense of the city. The city and Comcast further agree that all costs incurred by Comcast for supporting such EG Channel, including any and all equipment, return lines, and EG support grants may be designated as "costs of franchise requirements" or "external costs" as defined by the FCC and Comcast reserves its right to pass these costs through to the subscribers pursuant to federal law. 
(7)  Comcast shall provide at the EG origination site one complimentary cable drop and basic cable service (or equivalent) package, that includes EG Channels, including converter box, digital adapter, and other end user equipment, for purposes of monitoring the EG programming content transmitted over the cable system. 
(c)  EG capital grant. Comcast shall provide the city with a one-time capital grant to be used for EG Access capital and facilities related purposes. The EG Capital grant provided by Comcast shall be in the amount of $31,520.00. Such grant shall be paid to the city within 90 days of the effective date of this agreement. Such grant shall not be offset against any franchise fees remitted or due to the city. The city and Comcast agree that the cost of such grant may be designated as a "cost of franchise requirements" or "external cost" as defined by the FCC and Comcast reserves its right to pass these costs through to the subscribers pursuant to federal law.

Sec. 15-38. - Enforcement, insurance and indemnification. 
(a)  Violations and opportunity to cure. 
(1)  If the city has reason to believe that Comcast violated any material provision of this agreement, it shall notify Comcast in writing of the nature of such violation and the section(s) of this agreement that it believes has been violated and the details relating thereto. 
(2)  Comcast shall have 30 days to cure such violation after written notice is received by taking reasonable steps to comply with the terms of this agreement. If the nature of the violation is such that it cannot be fully cured within 30 days, the period of time in which Comcast must cure the violation shall be extended by the city in writing for such additional time necessary to complete the cure, provided that Comcast shall have promptly commenced to cure and is taking reasonable steps to cure in the reasonable judgment of the city. 
(3)  In the event that Comcast fails to respond to such notice of default and to cure the default or to take reasonable steps to cure the default within the required 45 day period, the city or its designee shall promptly schedule a public hearing no sooner than 14 days after written notice, by certified mail, to Comcast. Comcast shall be provided reasonable opportunity to offer evidence and be heard at such public hearing. Within 30 days after said public hearing, the city shall determine whether or not Comcast is in default of any provision of the agreement and shall issue a written determination of its findings. If after such public hearing and notice in which Comcast has been determined in default and the violation has not been cured and, in the city's judgment, Comcast has not taken reasonable steps to cure the violation, then the city may deem that Comcast is liable for liquidated damages and/or any other right or remedy in accordance with Section 15-38(b). 
(b)  Liquidated damages. 
(1)  Because Comcast's failure to comply with provisions of this agreement may result in harm to the city and because it will be difficult to measure the extent of such injury, the city may assess liquidated damages against Comcast in the amount of $150.00 per day for each day the violation continues, provided Comcast has had an opportunity to cure in accordance with Section 15-38(a)(2) supra. Such damages shall not be a substitute for specific performance by Comcast or legal action by the city, but shall be in addition to such specific performance or legal action. 
(2)  The first day for which liquidated damages may be assessed, if there has been no cure after the end of the applicable cure period, shall be the day after the end of the applicable cure period, including any extension of the cure period granted by the city. Liquidated damages may not be assessed for a time period exceeding 120 days per violation. The city may commence revocation proceedings and/or initiate an action in law or equity in a court of competent jurisdiction after the assessment of liquidated damages or in lieu of liquidated damages. 
(c)  Revocation. 
(1)  In addition to the other rights, powers and remedies retained by the city under this agreement, the city reserves the separate and distinct right to revoke this franchise if: 
a.  It is demonstrated that Comcast practiced any fraud or deceit upon the city in the operation of its cable system or any other activities pursuant to this agreement; 
b.  Comcast repeatedly fails, after notice and opportunity to cure, to maintain signal quality pursuant to the standards provided for by the FCC or the technical requirements set forth in Section 15-33(a); 
c.  Comcast repeatedly violates, after notice and opportunity to cure, one or more of the material terms or conditions of this agreement. 
(2)  The foregoing shall not constitute a violation of a material term or condition if the violation occurs without the fault of Comcast or occurs as a result of circumstances beyond its control or by reason of Force Majeure as defined in Section 15-39(a). Comcast shall not be excused from the performance of any of its obligations under this franchise by mere economic hardship or by the misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers or employees. 
(3)  A revocation shall be declared only by a written decision of the city council after an appropriate public hearing that shall afford Comcast due process and full opportunity to be heard. This shall include the ability to introduce evidence, to question witnesses and to respond to any notice of grounds to terminate in accordance with the standards of a fair hearing applicable to administrative hearings in the State of Delaware. All notice requirements shall be met by providing Comcast at least 30 days prior written notice (via certified mail-return receipt requested) of any public hearing concerning the proposed revocation of this franchise. Such notice shall state the grounds for revocation. The city, after a public hearing and upon finding the existence of grounds for revocation, may either declare this franchise terminated or excuse such grounds upon a showing by Comcast of mitigating circumstances or good cause for the existence of such grounds. The city shall issue such declaration and finding within 30 days in a written decision which shall be sent via certified or overnight mail to Comcast. Comcast may appeal such determination to an appropriate court. 
(d)  Performance bond. 
(1)  Comcast shall obtain and maintain, throughout the term of this agreement, at its sole cost and expense, a performance bond with a surety company licensed to do business in the State of Delaware to ensure Comcast's faithful performance of its obligations. The performance bond shall provide that the city may recover from the principal and surety any and all liquidated damages and/or compensatory damages incurred by the city for Comcast's violations of this agreement, after notice and opportunity to cure, in accordance with Sections 15-38(a) and 15-38(b). 
(2)  The performance bond shall be in the amount of $25,000.00. Comcast shall not reduce, cancel or materially change said bond from the requirement contained herein without the express prior written permission of the city. 
(e)  Insurance. 
(1)  Comcast shall obtain and maintain, in full force and effect, at its sole cost and expense, during the franchise term, the following minimum insurance coverage with an insurance company that is authorized to conduct business in Delaware and which has an A.M. Best rating (or equivalent) no less than A-minus VII, indemnifying the city from and against any and all claims for injury or damage to persons or property, both real and personal, caused by the construction, installation, reconstruction, operation, maintenance or removal of the cable system by Comcast or any of its contractors, subcontractors, agents or employees in the following amounts: 
a.  The amount of such insurance against liability for damage to property shall be no less than $1,000,000.00 as to any one occurrence. 
b.  The amount of such insurance against liability for injury or death to any person shall be no less than $1,000,000.00. 
c.  The amount of such insurance for aggregate claims shall be $3,000,000.00 in umbrella form. 
d.  The amount of such insurance against all claims arising out of the operation of motor vehicles and general tort or contract liability shall be $1,000,000.00. 
(2)  The city, its officials and employees, shall be designated as additional insureds under each of the insurance policies required in this Section 15-38(e). 
(3)  Comcast shall not cancel any required insurance policy without obtaining alternative insurance in conformance with this Section 15-38(e) and without submitting insurance certificates to the city verifying that Comcast has obtained such alternative insurance. Comcast shall provide the city with at least 30 days prior notice in the event the policies are cancelled or not renewed. 
(4)  Comcast shall deliver to the city certificates of insurance showing evidence of the required coverage within 30 days of a written request by the city. 
(f)  Indemnification. Comcast shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless the city, its elected and appointed officials, officers, agents and employees acting in their official capacities, from claims for injury, loss, liability, cost or expense arising in whole or in part from, caused by or connected with any act or omission of Comcast, its officers, agents, contractors, subcontractors or employees, arising out of, but not limited to, the construction, installation, upgrade, reconstruction, operation, maintenance or removal of the cable system. The city shall give Comcast timely written notice of its obligation to indemnify and defend the city. The obligation to indemnify, defend, save and hold the city harmless shall include, but not be limited to, the obligation to pay judgments, injuries, liabilities, damages, penalties, and reasonable attorneys' fees. If the city determines that it is necessary for it to employ separate counsel, in addition to that provided by Comcast, the cost for such separate counsel shall be the responsibility of the city. Comcast shall not indemnify the city for any claims resulting from acts of willful misconduct or negligence on the part of the city.

(2)  During the term of the agreement, if Comcast decides to abandon or no longer use all or part of its cable system, it shall give the city written notice of its intent at least 90 days prior to the announcement of such decision, which notice shall describe the property and its location. The city shall have the right to either require Comcast to remove the property, or remove the property itself and charge Comcast with the costs related thereto, or transfer ownership of the property to the city's designee provided fair market value is paid to Comcast. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the above, Comcast shall not be required to remove its cable system, or to relocate the cable system, or to sell the cable system, or any portion thereof as a result of revocation, denial of renewal, or any other lawful action to forbid or disallow Comcast from providing cable services, if the cable system is actively being used to facilitate any other services not governed by the Cable Act. 
(c)  Notices. The city hereby designates the city secretary to be the officer responsible for continuing administration of the franchise and for executing the authority for implementing the complaint procedures adopted by the city and Comcast.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, franchisee shall not indemnify LFA for any damages, liability, or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence of LFA, its officers, agents, employees, attorneys, consultants, independent contractors, or third parties or for any activity or function conducted by any person other than franchisee in connection with government access channel services, or EAS, or the distribution of any cable service over the cable system. 
(2)  With respect to franchisee's indemnity obligations set forth in subsection (1) above, franchisee shall provide the defense of any claims brought against LFA by selecting counsel of franchisee's choice to defend the claim, subject to the consent of LFA, which shall not unreasonably be withheld. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent LFA from cooperating with franchisee and participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel at its own cost and expense, provided however, that after consultation with LFA, franchisee shall have the right to defend, settle, or compromise any claim or action arising hereunder, and franchisee shall have the authority to decide the appropriateness and the amount of any such settlement. In the event that the terms of any such settlement do not include the release of LFA, and LFA does not consent to the terms of any such settlement or compromise, franchisee shall not settle the claim or action but its obligation to indemnify LFA shall in no event exceed the amount of such settlement. 
(3)  LFA shall hold harmless and defend franchisee from and against, and shall be responsible for damages, liability, or claims resulting from or arising out of, the willful misconduct or negligence of LFA. 
(4)  LFA shall be responsible for its own acts of willful misconduct or negligence, or breach of obligation, subject to any and all defenses and limitations of liability provided by law. Franchisee shall not be required to indemnify LFA for acts of LFA that constitute willful misconduct or negligence on the part of LFA, its officers, employees, agents, attorneys, consultants, independent contractors, or third parties.

Sec. 15-70. - Transfer of franchise. 
(a)  Transfer: Subject to Section 617 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 537, no transfer of the franchise shall occur without the prior consent of LFA, provided that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of franchisee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness, or for transactions otherwise excluded under Subsection 15-60(ff) above. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Amend. No. 2, 6-26-06)

(a)  Governing law: LFA and franchisee agree that any proceedings undertaken by LFA that relate to the renewal of this franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546. 
(b)  Needs assessments: In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626 of the Communications Act, LFA shall notify franchisee of all of its assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of franchisee under the then current franchise term. Such assessment shall be provided to franchisee by LFA promptly so that franchisee has adequate time to submit a proposal under Section 626 and complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its term. 
(c)  Informal negotiations: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, franchisee and LFA agree that at any time during the term of the then-current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to comment, LFA and franchisee may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then current franchise, and LFA may grant a renewal thereof. 
(d)  Consistent terms: Franchisee and LFA consider the terms set forth in this section to be consistent with the express provisions of Section 626. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Amend. No. 2, 6-26-06) 
Sec. 15-72. - Enforcement and termination of franchise. 
(a)  Notice of violation: If at any time LFA believes that franchisee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, LFA shall informally discuss the matter with franchisee. If these discussions do not lead to resolution of the problem in a reasonable time, LFA shall then notify franchisee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance in a reasonable time (for purposes of this article, the "noncompliance notice"). 
(b)  Franchisee's right to cure or respond: Franchisee shall have 30 days from receipt of the noncompliance notice to: (A) respond to LFA, if franchisee contests (in whole or in part) the assertion of noncompliance; (B) cure such noncompliance; or (C) in the event that, by its nature, such noncompliance cannot be cured within such 30 day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such noncompliance and notify LFA of the steps being taken and the date by which they are projected to be completed. Upon cure of any noncompliance, LFA shall provide written confirmation that such cure has been effected. 
(c)  Public hearing: In the event that franchisee fails to respond to the noncompliance notice pursuant to the procedures required by this section, or in the event that the alleged noncompliance is not remedied within 30 days or the date projected pursuant to Subsection (b)(C) above, if LFA seeks to continue its investigation into the alleged noncompliance, then LFA shall schedule a public hearing. LFA shall provide franchisee at least 30 business days' prior written notice of such public hearing, which will specify the time, place, and purpose of such public hearing, and provide franchisee the opportunity to be heard. 
(d)  Enforcement: Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event LFA, after the public hearing set forth in Subsection (c) above, determines that franchisee is in default of any provision of this franchise, LFA may: 
(1)  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; or 
(2)  Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or 
(3)  In the case of a substantial noncompliance with a material provision of this franchise, seek to revoke the franchise in accordance with subsection (e) herein. 
(e)  Revocation: Should LFA seek to revoke this franchise after following the procedures set forth above in this section, including the public hearing described in subsection (c) above, LFA shall give written notice to franchisee of such intent. The notice shall set forth the specific nature of the noncompliance. Franchisee shall have 90 days from receipt of such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event LFA has not received a satisfactory response from franchisee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a second public hearing. LFA shall cause to be served upon franchisee, at least 30 business days prior to such public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to revoke the franchise. 
(1)  At the designated public hearing, franchisee shall be provided a fair opportunity for full participation, including the rights to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce relevant evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel the relevant testimony of the officials, agents, employees, or consultants of LFA, to compel the testimony of other persons as permitted by law, and to question and/or cross examine witnesses. A complete verbatim record and transcript shall be made of such hearing. 
(2)  Following the second public hearing, franchisee shall be provided up to 30 days to submit its proposed findings and conclusions to LFA in writing, and thereafter LFA shall determine (A) whether an event of default has occurred under this franchise; (B) whether such event of default is excusable; and (C) whether such event of default has been cured or will be cured by franchisee. LFA shall also determine whether it will revoke the franchise based on the information presented or, where applicable, grant additional time to franchisee to effect any cure. If LFA determines that it will revoke the franchise, LFA shall promptly provide franchisee with a written determination setting forth LFA's reasoning for such revocation. Franchisee may appeal such written determination of LFA to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of LFA "de novo," to the extent permitted by law. Franchisee shall be entitled to such relief as the court finds appropriate. Such appeal must be taken within 60 days of franchisee's receipt of the written determination of LFA. 
(3)  LFA may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action that it deems appropriate to enforce LFA's rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise. 
(f)  Franchisee termination: Franchisee shall have the right to terminate this franchise and all obligations hereunder within 90 days after the end of three years from the service date of this franchise, if at the end of such three year period Franchisee does not then in good faith believe it has achieved a commercially reasonable level of subscriber penetration on its cable system. Franchisee may consider subscriber penetration levels outside the franchise area in this determination. Notice to terminate under this section shall be given to LFA in writing, with such termination to take effect no sooner than 120 days after giving such notice. Franchisee shall also be required to give its then current subscribers not less than 90 days' prior written notice of its intent to cease cable service operations.

Sec. 15-73. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Actions of parties: In any action by LFA or franchisee that is mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious, and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. 
(b)  Binding acceptance: This franchise shall bind and benefit the parties hereto and their respective heirs, beneficiaries, administrators, executors, receivers, trustees, successors, and assigns, and the promises and obligations herein shall survive the expiration date hereof. 
(c)  Preemption: In the event that federal or state law, rules, or regulations preempt a provision or limit the enforceability of a provision of this franchise, the provision shall be read to be preempted to the extent, and for the time, but only to the extent and for the time, required by law. In the event such federal or state law, rule, or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended, or otherwise changed so that the provision hereof that had been preempted is no longer preempted, such provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect, and shall thereafter be binding on the parties hereto, without the requirement of further action on the part of LFA. 
(d)  Force majeure: Franchisee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by a force majeure. 
(1)  Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not LFA's intention to subject franchisee to penalties, fines, forfeitures, or revocation of the franchise for violations of the franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on subscribers, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship being placed upon franchisee that outweigh the benefit to be derived by LFA and/or subscribers.

EXHIBIT C 
CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS 
    These standards shall, starting six months after the service date, apply to Franchisee to the extent it is providing cable services over the cable system in the Franchise area. 
SECTION 1: DEFINITIONS 
A.  Respond: Franchisee's investigation of a service Interruption by receiving a subscriber call and opening a trouble ticket, if required. 
B.  Significant Outage: A significant outage of the cable service shall mean any service interruption lasting at least four (4) continuous hours that affects at least ten percent (10%) of the subscribers in the service area. 
C.  Service Call: The action taken by Franchisee to correct a service interruption the effect of which is limited to an individual subscriber. 
D.  Standard Installation: Installations where the subscriber is within one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of trunk or feeder lines. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 2: TELEPHONE AVAILABILITY 
A.  Franchisee shall maintain a toll-free number to receive all calls and inquiries from subscribers in the Franchise area and/or residents regarding cable service. Franchisee representatives trained and qualified to answer questions related to cable service in the service area must be available to receive reports of service Interruptions 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and other inquiries at least 45 hours per week. Franchisee representatives shall identify themselves by name when answering this number. 
B.  Franchisee's telephone numbers shall be listed, with appropriate description (e.g. administration, customer service, billing, repair, etc.), in the directory published by the local telephone company or companies serving the service area, beginning with the next publication cycle after acceptance of this Franchise by Franchisee. 
C.  Franchisee may use an Automated Response Unit ("ARU") or a Voice Response Unit ("VRU") to distribute calls. If a foreign language routing option is provided, and the subscriber does not enter an option, the menu will default to the first tier menu of English options. 
After the first tier menu (not including a foreign language rollout) has run through three times, if customers do not select any option, the ARU or VRU will forward the call to a queue for a live representative. Franchisee may reasonably substitute this requirement with another method of handling calls from customers who do not have touch-tone telephones. 
D.  Under normal operating conditions, calls received by Franchisee shall be answered within 30 seconds. Franchisee shall meet this standard for 90% of the calls it receives at all call centers receiving calls from subscribers, as measured on a cumulative quarterly calendar basis. Measurement of this standard shall include all calls received by Franchisee at all call centers receiving calls from subscribers, whether they are answered by a live representative, by an automated attendant, or abandoned after 30 seconds of call waiting. 
E.  Under normal operating conditions, callers to Franchisee shall receive a busy signal no more than three percent of the time during any calendar quarter. 
At the Franchisee's option, the measurements above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The Franchisee shall notify the LFA of such a change at least 30 days in advance of any implementation. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 3: INSTALLATIONS AND SERVICE APPOINTMENTS 
A.  All installations will be in accordance with FCC rules, including but not limited to, appropriate grounding, connection of equipment to ensure reception of cable service, and the provision of required consumer information and literature to adequately inform the subscriber in the utilization of Franchisee-supplied equipment and cable service. 
B.  The standard installation shall be performed within seven business days after the placement of the Optical Network Terminal ("ONT") on the customer's premises or within seven business days after an order is placed if the ONT is already installed on the customer's premises. Franchisee shall meet this standard for 95% of the standard installations it performs, as measured on a calendar quarter basis, excluding customer requests for connection later than seven days after ONT placement or later than seven days after an order is placed if the ONT is already installed on the customer's premises. 
C.  Franchisee will offer subscribers "appointment window" alternatives for arrival to perform installations, service calls, and other activities of a maximum four hours scheduled time block during appropriate daylight available hours, usually beginning at 8:00 AM unless it is deemed appropriate to begin earlier by location exception. At Franchisee's discretion, Franchisee may offer subscribers appointment arrival times other than these four hour time blocks, if agreeable to the subscriber. These hour restrictions do not apply to weekends. At the Franchisee's option, the measurements above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The Franchisee shall notify the LFA of such a change at least 30 days in advance of any implementation. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 4: SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS AND OUTAGES 
A.  Franchisee shall promptly notify LFA of any significant outage of the cable service. 
B.  Franchisee shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to limit any significant outage for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, or constructing the cable system. Except in an emergency or other situation necessitating a more expedited or alternative notification procedure, Franchisee may schedule a significant outage for a period of more than four hours during any 24-hour period only after LFA and each affected subscriber in the service area have been given 15 days' prior notice of the proposed significant outage. 
C.  Franchisee representatives who are capable of responding to service interruptions must be available to respond 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
D.  Under normal operating conditions, Franchisee must respond to a call from a subscriber regarding a service Interruption or other service problems within the following time frames: 
(1)  Within 24 hours, including weekends, of receiving subscriber calls respecting service interruptions in the service area. 
(2)  Franchisee must begin actions to correct all other cable service problems the next business day after notification by the subscriber or LFA of a cable service problem. 
E.  Under normal operating conditions, Franchisee shall complete service calls within 72 hours of the time Franchisee commences to respond to the service interruption, not including weekends and situations where the subscriber is not reasonably available for a service call to correct the service interruption within the 72-hour period. 
F.  Franchisee shall meet the standard in Subsection E of this section for 90% of the service calls it completes, as measured on a quarterly basis. 
G.  Under normal operating conditions, Franchisee shall provide a credit upon subscriber request when all channels received by that subscriber are out of service for a period of four consecutive hours or more. The credit shall equal, at a minimum, a proportionate amount of the affected subscriber(s) current monthly bill. In order to qualify for the credit, the subscriber must promptly report the problem and allow Franchisee to verify the problem if requested by Franchisee. If subscriber availability is required for repair, a credit will not be provided for such time, if any, that the subscriber is not reasonably available. 
At the Franchisee's option, the measurements above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The Franchisee shall notify the LFA of such a change at least 30 days in advance of any implementation. 
H.  Under normal operating conditions, if a significant outage affects all video programming cable services for more than 24 consecutive hours, Franchisee shall issue an automatic credit to the affected subscribers in the amount equal to their monthly recurring charges for the proportionate time the cable service was out, or a credit to the affected subscribers in the amount equal to the charge for the basic plus enhanced basic level of service for the proportionate time the cable service was out, whichever is technically feasible or, if both are technically feasible, as determined by Franchisee provided such determination is nondiscriminatory. Such credit shall be reflected on subscriber billing statements within the next available billing cycle following the outage. 
I.  With respect to service issues concerning cable services provided to LFA facilities, Franchisee shall respond to all inquiries from LFA within four hours and shall commence necessary repairs within 24 hours under normal operating conditions. If such repairs cannot be completed within 24 hours, Franchisee shall notify LFA in writing as to the reason(s) for the delay and provide an estimated time of repair. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 5: CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS 
    Under normal operating conditions, Franchisee shall investigate subscriber complaints referred by LFA within 72 hours. Franchisee shall notify LFA of those matters that necessitate an excess of 72 hours to resolve, but those matters must be resolved within 15 days of the initial complaint. LFA may require reasonable documentation to be provided by Franchisee to substantiate the request for additional time to resolve the problem. For purposes of this Section, "resolve" means that Franchisee shall perform those actions which, in the normal course of business, are necessary to investigate and correct the problem underlying customer's complaint and advise the customer thereof. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 6: BILLING 
A.  Subscriber bills must be itemized to describe cable services purchased by subscribers and related equipment charges. Bills shall clearly delineate activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates, credits, and aggregate late charges. Franchisee shall, without limitation as to additional line items, be allowed to itemize as separate line items, Franchise fees, taxes, and/or other governmentally imposed fees. Franchisee shall maintain records of the date and place of mailing of bills. 
B.  Every subscriber with a current account balance sending payment directly to Franchisee shall be given at least 20 days from the date statements are mailed to the subscriber until the payment due date. 
C.  A specific due date shall be listed on the bill of every subscriber whose account is current. Delinquent accounts may receive a bill that lists the due date as upon receipt; however, the current portion of that bill shall not be considered past due except in accordance with Subsection 6.B. above. 
D.  Any subscriber who, in good faith, disputes all or part of any bill shall have the option of withholding the disputed amount without disconnect or late fee being assessed until the dispute is resolved provided that: 
(1)  The subscriber pays all undisputed charges; 
(2)  The subscriber provides notification of the dispute to Franchisee within five days prior to the due date; 
(3)  The subscriber cooperates in determining the accuracy and/or appropriateness of the charges in dispute; and 
(4)  It shall be within Franchisee's sole discretion to determine when the dispute has been resolved. 
E.  Under normal operating conditions, Franchisee shall initiate investigation and resolution of all billing complaints received from subscribers within five business days of receipt of the complaint. Final resolution shall not be unreasonably delayed. 
F.  Franchisee shall provide a telephone number and address on the bill for subscribers to contact Franchisee. 
G.  Franchisee shall forward a copy of any cable service related billing inserts or other mailing sent to subscribers to LFA upon request. 
H.  Franchisee shall provide all subscribers with the option of paying for cable service by check or an automatic payment option where the amount of the bill is automatically deducted from a checking account designated by the subscriber. Franchisee may in the future, at its discretion, permit payment by using a major credit card on a preauthorized basis. Based on credit history, at the option of Franchisee, the payment alternative may be limited. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 7: DEPOSITS. REFUNDS. AND CREDITS 
A.  Franchisee may require refundable deposits from subscribers 1) with a poor credit or poor payment history, 2) who refuse to provide credit history information to Franchisee, or 3) who rent subscriber equipment from Franchisee, so long as such deposits are applied on a nondiscriminatory basis. The deposit Franchisee may charge subscribers with poor credit or poor payment history or who refuse to provide credit information may not exceed an amount equal to an average subscriber's monthly charge multiplied by six. The maximum deposit Franchisee may charge for subscriber equipment is the cost of the equipment that Franchisee would need to purchase to replace the equipment rented to the subscriber. 
B.  Franchisee shall refund or credit the subscriber for the amount of the deposit collected for equipment, which is unrelated to poor credit or poor payment history, after one year and provided the subscriber has demonstrated good payment history during this period. Franchisee shall pay interest on other deposits if required by law. 
C.  Under normal operating conditions, refund checks will be issued within the next available billing cycle following the resolution of the event giving rise to the refund (e.g., equipment return and final bill payment). 
D.  Credits for cable service will be issued no later than the subscriber's next available billing cycle, following the determination that a credit is warranted, and the credit is approved and processed. Such approval and processing shall not be unreasonably delayed. 
E.  Bills shall be considered paid when appropriate payment is received by Franchisee or its authorized agent. Appropriate time considerations shall be included in Franchisee's collection procedures to assure that payments due have been received before late notices or termination notices are sent. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 8: RATES, FEES, AND CHARGES 
A.  Franchisee shall not, except to the extent expressly permitted by law, impose any fee or charge for service calls to a subscriber's premises to perform any repair or maintenance work related to Franchisee equipment necessary to receive cable service, except where such problem is caused by a negligent or wrongful act of the subscriber (including, but not limited to a situation in which the subscriber reconnects Franchisee equipment incorrectly) or by the failure of the subscriber to take reasonable precautions to protect Franchisee's equipment (for example, a dog chew). 
B.  Franchisee shall provide reasonable notice to subscribers of the possible assessment of a late fee on bills or by separate notice. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 9: DISCONNECTION/DENIAL OF SERVICE 
A.  Franchisee shall not terminate cable service for nonpayment of a delinquent account unless Franchisee mails a notice of the delinquency and impending termination prior to the proposed final termination. The notice shall be mailed to the subscriber to whom the cable service is billed. The notice of delinquency and impending termination may be part of a billing statement. 
B.  Cable service terminated in error must be restored without charge within 24 hours of notice. If a subscriber was billed for the period during which cable service was terminated in error, a credit shall be issued to the subscriber if the service interruption was reported by the subscriber. 
C.  Nothing in these standards shall limit the right of Franchisee to deny cable service for non-payment of previously provided cable services, refusal to pay any required deposit, theft of cable service, damage to Franchisee's equipment, abusive and/or threatening behavior toward Franchisee's employees or representatives, or refusal to provide credit history information or refusal to allow Franchisee to validate the identity, credit history, and credit worthiness via an external credit agency. 
D.  Charges for cable service will be discontinued at the time of the requested termination of service by the subscriber, except equipment charges may by applied until equipment has been returned. No period of notice prior to requested termination of service can be required of subscribers by Franchisee. No charge shall be imposed upon the subscriber for or related to total disconnection of cable service or for any cable service delivered after the effective date of the disconnect request, unless there is a delay in returning Franchisee equipment or early termination charges apply pursuant to the subscriber's service contract. If the subscriber fails to specify an effective date for disconnection, the subscriber shall not be responsible for cable services received after the day following the date the disconnect request is received by Franchisee. For purposes of this subsection, the term "disconnect" shall include subscribers who elect to cease receiving cable service from Franchisee and to receive cable service or other multi-channel video service from another person or entity. 
(Ord. No. 06-15, Exh. C, 6-26-06) 
SECTION 10: COMMUNICATIONS WITH SUBSCRIBERS 
A.  All Franchisee personnel, contractors, and subcontractors contacting subscribers or potential subscribers outside the office of Franchisee shall wear a clearly visible identification card bearing their name and photograph. Franchisee shall make reasonable effort to account for all identification cards at all times.

Every service vehicle of Franchisee and its contractors or subcontractors shall be clearly identified as such to the public. Specifically, Franchisee vehicles shall have Franchisee's logo plainly visible. The vehicles of those contractors and subcontractors working for Franchisee shall have the contractor's/subcontractor's name plus markings (such as a magnetic door sign) indicating they are under contract to Franchisee. 
B.  All contact with a subscriber or potential subscriber by a person representing Franchisee shall be conducted in a courteous manner. 
C.  Franchisee shall send annual notices to all subscribers informing them that any complaints or inquiries not satisfactorily handled by Franchisee may be referred to LFA. 
D.  All notices identified in this section shall be by either: 
(1)  A separate document included with a billing statement or included on the portion of the monthly bill that is to be retained by the subscriber; or 
(2)  A separate electronic notification.

(a)  Generally. Vehicular traffic facing the red traffic signal shall stop before crossing the stop limit, whether marked by sign or painted line, or if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. 
(b)  Traffic light signal violation monitoring program. A failure to stop for a red traffic signal may be recorded by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system in accordance with a program or authorization approved by the City Manager, pursuant to the provisions of 21 Del. C. § 4101(d) and this section. The administration and enforcement of the provisions of this section shall be done in accordance with the provisions of 21 Del. C. § 4101(d) which shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the provisions of this section. 
(1)  The owner or operator of a vehicle which has failed to comply with a traffic light signal, as evidenced by information obtained by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system, shall be liable for a civil or administrative monetary assessment of $75.00; provided, however, if the civil or administrative assessment is not paid within 14 days an additional assessment of $10.00 shall be added to the original assessment; which additional assessment shall be increased to $20.00 if the assessment is not paid within 45 days; and shall be increased to $30.00 if the assessment is not paid within 90 days. Court costs or similar administrative fees not to exceed $30.00 may also be assessed if the owner requests a hearing to contest the violation, and is ultimately found to be in violation or fails to pay or contest the violation in a timely manner. 
(2)  A violation for which a civil or administrative assessment is imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not be classified as a criminal offense. Judgments pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction of the owner and shall not be made part of the motor vehicle operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed. 
(3)  Definitions. For purposes of this subsection only: 
a.  "Owner" means the registered owner of such vehicle on record with the Division of Motor Vehicles; provided, however, that in the event that the owner is a vehicle leasing company licensed to do business in this state, the "owner" for purposes of this subsection shall mean the person shown on the records of the Division of Motor Vehicles to be the lessee of such vehicle. Vehicle rental companies are excluded from the definition of "owner" for purposes of this subsection only. 
b.  "Traffic light signal violation monitoring system" means a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with a traffic light that automatically produces two or more photographs, two or more microphotographs, a videotape, or other recorded images of each vehicle at the time it is used or operated in violation of this subsection. 
(4)  Summons and notice of violation. A summons for a violation of this subsection may be executed by mailing by first-class mail a copy thereof to the address of the owner of the vehicle as shown on the records of the Division of Motor Vehicles of this or any other state. Collection actions, including default judgment and execution, may proceed based upon jurisdiction obtained through the mailing by first class mail of a summons and subsequent court notices pursuant to this subsection. Every initial mailing shall include the following: 
a.  Name and address of the owner of the vehicle; 
b.  Registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation; 
c.  Violation charges; 
d.  Location where the violation occurred; 
e.  Date and time of the violation; 
f.  Copies of two or more photographs, or microphotographs or other recorded images, taken as proof of the violation; 
g.  Amount of the civil assessment imposed and the date by which the civil assessment should be paid; 
h.  Information advising the summonsed person of the matter, time and place by which liability as alleged in the notice may be contested, and warning that the failure to pay the civil assessment or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability and may result in a judgment being entered against the summonsed person and/or the denial of the registration or the renewal of the registration of any of the owner's vehicles; and 
i.  Notice of the summonsed person's ability to rebut the presumption that he or she was the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and the means for rebutting such presumption. 
All subsequent mailing of court notices, summons, and payment requests shall include all information listed in subparagraphs a. through i. of this subdivision. 
(5)  Payment by voluntary assessment. Persons electing to pay by voluntary assessment shall make payments to the entity designated on the summons for payment. Procedures for payment under this subsection shall be as provided by court rule of the Justice of the Peace Court. 
(6)  Procedures to contest the violation. A person receiving the summons pursuant to this subsection may request a hearing to contest the violation by notifying, in writing, the entity designated on the summons within 20 days of the date. Upon receipt of a timely request for a hearing a civil hearing shall be scheduled and the defendant notified of the hearing date by first class mail. A civil hearing shall be held by the Justice of the Peace Court. The hearing may be informal and shall be held in accordance with Justice of the Peace Court rules. Costs for such hearing shall not be assessed against the prevailing party. 
(7)  Failure to pay or successfully contest the violation. If the owner fails to pay the civil assessment, to respond to the summons within the time period specified on the summons, and/or to successfully contest the civil assessment resulting from the violation, the City Manager shall notify the Division of Motor Vehicles of such facts. In addition, the City Manager shall refer the unpaid assessment and costs to the Finance Department for the collection of these assessments and the City Solicitor may enforce the assessments by civil action, including seeking judgment and execution on a judgment against the owner in accordance with this subsection. 
(8)  Proof of violation. Proof of a violation of this subsection shall be evidenced by information obtained from a traffic light signal violation monitoring system authorized pursuant to this subsection. A certificate, or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images produced by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system shall constitute prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein, if the certificate, or facsimile thereof, is sown to or affirmed by a technician employed by a locality authorized to impose assessments pursuant to this subsection, or by an employee of an entity designated by such locality to administer records under this subsection. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation pursuant to regulation, ordinance or other law adopted pursuant to this subsection. Any affidavit submitted pursuant to subsection (9)a. shall be admissible in any proceeding to contest the violation. 
(9)  Presumptions. The owner of any vehicle found to be in violation of this subsection shall be held prima facie responsible for such violation unless the owner can furnish evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, in the care, custody or control of another person. Such presumption shall be rebutted if the owner: 
a.  Furnishes an affidavit by regular mail to the entity indicated on the summons that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and provides the name and address of the person or company who leased, rented or otherwise had the care, custody or control of the vehicle, or attaches a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle or license plate(s) thereof had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation of this subsection; or 
b.  Provides proof at the hearing to contest the violation that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the allege violation or that he or she failed to comply with the traffic signal either in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or as part of a funeral procession. 
(c)  [Compliance.] Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, if the motor vehicle which is found by the traffic light signal violation monitoring system to have failed to comply with traffic light signal is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time and location of the violation with two photographs thereof. Within ten days of the receipt of said notice, the owner of the vehicle shall provide the law enforcement agency which has issued the summons with the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the date, time and location of the violation and within the same time period, shall provide the driver of the vehicle with the photographs of the violation. After receipt by the law enforcement agency which has issued the summons of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation in the same manner as provided under 21 Del. C. § 7003 and shall be subject to the provisions of this section. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of subsection (b) to provide the name and address of the driver at the time of the violation within the period prescribed shall cause the owner to be held responsible as set forth in subsection (b)(3). 
(d)  Applicability. This ordinance shall apply to all cases arising, opened or reopened on or after March 7, 2005, as well as those cases pending on its effective date, March 7, 2005, without regard to the date of the alleged violation.

Note- See the editor's note following § 20-20. 
Sec. 20-24. - Traffic-control signal legend. 
(a)  Whenever traffic controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word or symbol legend, and such lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)  Green indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a traffic-control device at such place prohibited either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Section 20-25 of this chapter, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Circular yellow or yellow arrow: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the circular yellow signal is thereby warned that a red signal for the previously permitted movement will be exhibited immediately thereafter. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing the yellow arrow signal shown alone or in combination with another indication is thereby warned that the previously displayed green arrow signal is being terminated. The yellow arrow signal may be followed by a red signal or a green signal. 
State Law reference- Similar state law, 21 Del. Code Anno. § 4108 (1953). 
c.  Pedestrians facing a yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Red indication : 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing the red signal shall stop before crossing the stop limit, whether marked by sign or painted line, or if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
b.  When a traffic-control device is not in place prohibiting such turn, vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way roadway onto a one-way roadway. 
c.  When turns on red are permitted, the right to proceed to turn after stopping shall be subject to the rule applicable after making a stop as at a stop sign. 
d.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic. 
(4)  Green arrow or arrows : 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
b.  Vehicles facing such signals are thereby advised that other traffic movements may be prohibited from the lane or lanes that the signal indication controls. Making or attempting to make any prohibited movement is unlawful. 
c.  Pedestrians facing such signals shall not enter the roadway unless they can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic. 
(5)  When lane use control signals are placed over the individual lanes of roadway or highway, vehicular traffic may travel in any lane or lanes over which a green signal is shown, but shall not enter or travel in any lane or lanes over which a red signal is shown. Left turns may be made across such lane if not otherwise prohibited. Vehicular traffic shall move from any lane over which a steady amber signal is displayed as soon as the movement can be made in safety. Vehicular traffic may use a lane over which a flashing yellow signal is displayed for the purpose of making a left turn. 
(6)  In the event that traffic signals are in place and no lighted indication is visible to an approaching driver, he shall reduce speed and prepare to yield to other vehicles in or approaching the intersection. 
(7)  Whoever violates this section shall be fined not less than $75.00 nor more than $115.00. Whoever violates paragraph (3)a. of this section shall be fined not less than $75.00 nor more than $230.00.

No person sentenced under this paragraph shall receive a suspended sentence. 
A conviction for a violation of a criminal statute dealing with injury or death caused to another person by the person's driving or operation of a vehicle if driving under the influence was included as an element of such charge, shall constitute such a first or similar offense if occurring within ten years from the subsequent offense.

(h)  First offenders; election of rehabilitation program. 
(1)  Any person who: 
a.  Has not within ten years been convicted of any offense under this section or Section 4177 of Title 21 of the Delaware Code or under any offense of the United States or of any state or of the District of Columbia or a local ordinance which deals with driving, operating, or having actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. For the purpose of computing the periods of time, the period shall run from the date of commission of the prior offense to the date of commission of the charged offense; and 
b.  Has not accumulated three or more moving violations within two years of the date of the offense in question on his driving record according to the records of the division of motor vehicles of the person's state of residence; and 
c.  Was not, with respect to the offense in question, involved in an accident resulting in injury to any person other than himself; and 
d.  Did not have a blood alcohol content measured at a level of .15 or higher as shown by a chemical analysis of a blood, breath, or urine sample taken within four hours of the alleged offense; and 
e.  Was not driving without a valid license or under a suspended or revoked license at the time of the offense in question, may qualify for the first offense election at the time of his arraignment. The court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused may defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon terms and conditions, including enrollment in a course of instruction or program of rehabilitation established pursuant to Title 21, Section 4177D of the Delaware State Code. If he elects to apply, his application shall constitute a waiver of the right to speedy trial. If the person elects not to apply, or if he is not accepted, he shall promptly be arraigned for a violation of this section. 
(2)  If a term or condition of probation is violated, including failure to appear for evaluation at an assigned evaluating agency, he shall be brought before the court, or if he fails to appear before the court, in either case, upon a determination by the court that the terms have been violated, the court shall enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided under this section. 
(3)  Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of probation, including satisfactory completion of the course of instruction and/or program of rehabilitation, and payment of all fees, the court shall discharge the person and the proceedings against him and shall simultaneously, with said discharge and dismissal, submit to the division of motor vehicles a written report specifying the name of the person and the nature of the proceedings against him which report shall be retained by the division of motor vehicles for further proceedings, if required. 
(4)  The driver's license and/or driving privileges of a person applying for enrollment in an education or rehabilitation program pursuant to subsection (h)(1) of this section shall forthwith be revoked by the secretary for a period of one year. If the person is accepted into the education or rehabilitation program, the period of revocation shall be for one year from the date of the initial revocation. If the person is not accepted for enrollment, or if he is found by the court to be in violation of the terms of enrollment, the revocation under this section shall continue until sentence is imposed. This revocation $hall not be concurrent with or part of any period of revocation established under any other provision of this section or of Subchapter IX, Chapter 41, Title 21, of the Delaware Code. 
(5)  The prosecutor or solicitor of the City of Newark may move the sentencing court to apply the provisions of this section to any person who does not come within the prescription of paragraph (h)(1)a. but would otherwise be disqualified for consideration under this section because of the applicability of one or more of the provisions found in paragraph (h)(1)b. through (h)(1)e. of this section. In the event of such a motion by the city prosecutor or city solicitor, the court may in its discretion apply the terms of this section to such person. 
(6)  If a person accepts the first offense election under this section, he shall immediately be eligible to apply for an ignition interlock device license pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in Title 21, Section 4177C of the Delaware Code. 
(i)  Any person who, as a first offender, has satisfactorily completed a course and/or program established pursuant to Title 21, Section 4177D of the Delaware Code shall be permitted to apply for reinstatement of their driver's license and/or driving privileges pursuant to the terms of Title 21, Section 4177C (d) of the Delaware Code. 
(j)  In accordance with Section 2742 of Title 21 of the Delaware Code, on behalf of the secretary of public safety, a Newark police officer offering a chemical test or directing the administration of a chemical test, shall serve immediate notice of revocation on a person who-refuses to permit chemical testing, after being informed of the penalty of revocation for such refusal, or on a person who is given a chemical test and is arrested, on that occasion, either before or after said test, for a violation of this section or Section 4177 of Title 21 of the Delaware Code. The officer shall take the Delaware license or permit of the driver in any such case and issue a temporary license effective only for 15 days with a provision for an additional period if a written request for hearing is received by the division of motor vehicles within the 15-day period. The police officer shall send the person's driver's license or permit to the secretary along with the certificate required by Section 2742(b) or (c) of Title 21 of the Delaware Code. The officer may, however, take reasonable steps to conduct such chemical testing even without the consent of the person if he seeks to conduct such test or tests without informing the person of the penalty of revocation for such refusal, thereby invoking the provisions of implied consent law. 
(k)  Reserved. 
(l)  Upon the trial of any action or proceeding arising out of the acts alleged to have been committed by any person while in violation of this section, the court may admit evidence of the refusal of such person to submit to a chemical test of his breath, blood or urine as directed by Subchapter III, Chapter 27 of Title 21 of the Delaware Code. 
(m)  Upon the trial of any action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while under the influence of alcohol, a drug or drugs, with respect to any chemical test taken by or at the request of the city, the court shall admit the results of a chemical test of a person's breath, blood or urine according to normal rules of search and seizure law. The informing or failure to inform the accused concerning the implied consent law shall not affect the admissibility of such results in any case, including a prosecution for a violation of this section. The informing of an accused concerning the implied consent law shall only have application and be relevant at a hearing concerning the revocation of the driver's license of said person for a violation of the implied consent law. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be deemed to preclude the admissibility of such evidence when such evidence would otherwise be admissible under the law relative to search and seizure law such as when evidence has been obtained by valid consent or other means, making the obtaining of the evidence legal under the Fourth Amendment. 
(n)  The doctor-patient privilege shall not apply to the disclosure to law enforcement personnel nor the admissibility into evidence in any criminal proceeding of the results of a chemical test of a person's blood, breath or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol or drug content of his blood irrespective of whether such test was done at the request of a treating physician, other medical personnel, or a peace officer. 
(o)  In any proceeding in which an issue is whether any person was driving, operating, or had in actual physical control a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, evidence may be admitted of the amount of alcohol in the blood of such person taken within four hours of the time when such person is alleged to have driven said motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, as shown by a medical or chemical analysis of his breath, blood, urine, or saliva. 
(p)  Liability for towing expenses. Whenever a motor vehicle is towed in connection with the enforcement of this section or a criminal offense for which driving under the influence is an element, the person to whom the vehicle is released shall be liable for the towing and storage costs, except that the police agency ordering such towing shall be liable for such costs if the driver was not actually arrested for driving in violation of this section, Section 4177, Title 21, Delaware Code, or other criminal offense as a result of that incident, and no other existing situation reasonably necessitated such towing. Vehicles so towed and unclaimed by the owner or other persons entitled to the vehicle shall be subject to the procedures governing the sale of unrepossessed vehicles as specified in Section 20-126.1 of this code. 
(q)  No person shall be guilty under subsection (a) of this section when the person has not consumed alcohol prior to or during driving, but has only consumed alcohol after the person has ceased driving and only such consumption after driving caused the person to have an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more within four hours after the time of driving. Further, no person shall be guilty under subsection (a) of this section when the person's alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more at the time of testing only as a result of the consumption of a sufficient quantity of alcohol that occurred after the person ceased driving and before any sampling which raised the person's alcohol concentration to 0.08 or more within four hours after the time of driving. 
(r)  (1)  For the purpose of introducing evidence of a person's alcohol concentration pursuant to this section, a report signed by the forensic toxicologist, forensic chemist, or state police forensic analytical chemist who performed the test or tests as to its nature is prima facie evidence, without the necessity of the forensic toxicologist, forensic chemist, or state police forensic analytical chemist personally appearing in court: 
a.  That the blood delivered was properly tested under procedures approved by the forensic sciences laboratory, office of the chief medical examiner, or the Delaware State Police Crime Laboratory; 
b.  That those procedures are legally reliable; 
c.  That the blood was delivered by the officer or persons stated in the report; and, 
d.  That the blood contained the alcohol therein stated. 
(2)  Any report introduced under paragraph (1) of this subsection must: 
a.  Identify the forensic toxicologist, forensic chemist, or state police forensic analytical chemist as an individual certified by the forensic sciences laboratory, office of the chief medical examiner, the Delaware State Police Crime Laboratory, or any county or municipal police department employing scientific analysis of blood, as qualified under standards approved by the forensic sciences laboratory, office of the chief medical examiner, or the Delaware State Police Crime Laboratory to analyze the blood; 
b.  State that the person made an analysis of the blood under the procedures approved by the forensic sciences laboratory, office of the chief medical examiner, or the Delaware State Police Crime Laboratory; and, 
c.  State that the blood, in his or her opinion, contains the resulting alcohol concentration within the meaning of this section. 
Nothing in this subsection precludes the right of any party to introduce any evidence supporting or contradicting the evidence contained in the report entered pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection. 
(3)  For purposes of establishing the chain of physical custody or control of evidence defined in this section, a statement signed by each successive person in the chain of custody that the person delivered it to the other person indicated on or about the date stated is prima facie evidence that the person had custody and made the delivery stated, without the necessity of a personal appearance in court by the person signing the statement, in accordance with the same procedures outlined in 10 Del. C. § 4331(3). 
(4)  In a criminal proceeding, the prosecution shall, upon written demand of a defendant filed in the proceedings at least 15 days prior to the trial, require the presence of the forensic toxicologist, forensic chemist, state police forensic analytical chemist, or any person in the chain of custody as a witness in the proceeding. However, it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to present the testimony of a person who has withdrawn blood from a person pursuant to this section in order to establish a chain of physical custody of evidence. 
(s)  In addition to any other powers of arrest, any law enforcement officer is hereby authorized to arrest without a warrant any person who the officer has probable cause to believe has violated the provisions of this section, regardless of whether the alleged violation was committed in the presence of such officer. This authority to arrest extends to any hospital or other medical treatment facility located beyond the territorial limits of the officer's jurisdiction provided there is probable cause to believe that the violation of this section occurred within four hours of the alleged driving of a vehicle if there is reason to believe the person has fled the scene of an accident in which he or she was involved, and provided there is probable cause to believe that the violation of this section occurred within the officer's jurisdiction. 
(t)  Driving by person under the age of 21 after consumption of alcohol; penalties. 
(1)  Whoever, being under the age of 21 years, drives, operates, or has actual physical control of a vehicle, an off-highway vehicle, or a moped while consuming or after having consumed alcoholic liquor, shall have his or her driver's license and/or privileges revoked for a period of two months for the first offense and not less than six months nor more than 12 months for each subsequent offense and shall be fined $200.00 for the first offense and not less than $400.00 nor more than $1,000.00 for each subsequent offense. 
(2)  In any proceeding under this section, evidence may be admitted of the amount of alcohol in the blood or breath of such underage person as determined by a specimen taken within four hours of the time when such person is alleged to have driven, operated, or been in control of a vehicle after having consumed alcoholic liquor as shown by an analysis of his or her breath, blood, urine, or saliva. Evidence that there was at the time of the test an alcohol concentration of .02 or more in his or her blood or breath is prima facie evidence that the person had consumed alcoholic liquor. "Alcohol concentration of .02 or more in his or her blood or breath" shall mean (1) an amount of alcohol in a sample of a person's blood equivalent to .02 or more grams of alcohol per hundred milliliters of blood; or (2) an amount of alcohol in a sample of a person's breath equivalent to .02 or more grams per two hundred ten liters of breath. This provision shall not preclude a conviction based upon other admissible evidence. 
(3)  In addition to any other powers of arrest, any police officer is hereby authorized to arrest without a warrant any person who the officer has probable cause to believe has violated the provisions of this section, regardless of whether the alleged violation was committed in the presence of such officer. 
(4)  In addition to any penalty for a violation of subsection (t)(1) of this section the court shall order the person to complete a drug and alcohol evaluation and to complete a program of education or rehabilitation pursuant to Title 21, Section 4177 D of the Delaware State Code. 
(u)  Prohibited alcohol offenses for commercial motor vehicle drivers. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a person may not drive, operate, or be in physical control of a commercial motor vehicle within this city while having any measurable amount of alcohol in his or her system. 
(2)  A person who drives, operates, or is in physical control of a commercial vehicle within this city while having any measurable amount of alcohol in his or her system or who refuses to submit to an alcohol test as provided herein shall be placed out of service for 24 hours. 
(3)  Any person who drives, operates, or is in physical control of a commercial motor vehicle within this city with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or more shall, in addition to any other sanctions which may be imposed under this chapter, be disqualified from driving a commercial motor vehicle under this chapter.

The minimum fine levied for a violation of this subsection shall not be subject to suspension or avoidance for any reason. 
(w)  First offense election-ignition interlock device diversion. If a person accepts the first offense election under this section, such person may also elect at that time to participate in the First Offense Election-Ignition Interlock Device (FOE-IID) Diversion as part of his or her probation. If a person elects to participate in the FOE-IID Diversion, such act shall constitute an agreement to all terms and conditions contained in the Ignition Interlock Device Program set forth in Section 4177F of Title 21 of the Delaware Code. Failure to comply with any part of this section or Section 4177F of Title 21 of the Delaware Code shall be considered a violation of the participant's probation.

XVIII, §§ 20-121-20-127, relative to the disposition of illegally parked or abandoned vehicles, and enacting in lieu thereof a new Art. XVIII, §§ 20-121-20-127, as herein set out. Former Art. XVIII was derived from Code 1959, Ch. 14, §§ 410.2, 410.12, 410.13, 410.23-410.25; Ord. No. 69-12, adopted May 13, 1969; Ord. No. 70-18, § 2, adopted March 30, 1970; and Ord. No. 70-25, adopted May 26, 1970. 

Sec. 20-121. - Generally. 
(a)  Generally; authority. Whenever any vehicle of any kind or character shall be found within the city on any street, highway, alley, public parking lot or private parking lot containing in excess of four spaces, wrecked, abandoned, or parked in violation of any laws of the state, or the provisions of this chapter or other ordinance of the City of Newark, or whenever such vehicle has accumulated unpaid fines and/or summonses in excess of the amounts set forth in subsection (d) of this section, any regulation issued by the city manager, or police department, now or hereafter in force, shall be seized for any violation thereof, such vehicle shall be issued an appropriate citation, and/or shall be immobilized in such manner as to prevent its operation, and/or shall be removed by authority of the City of Newark, city manager, and/or police department, to an official pound; provided that if the owner or operator of said vehicle is present and shall express a willingness and intention to immediately remove such vehicle before it has been immobilized or affixed to a tow vehicle, said vehicle shall be released to the owner or person in charge who shall be required to pay the same fine as imposed under Section 20-240 of this Code. No vehicle shall be released to its owner or operator if the immobilization or towing thereof is due to the accumulation of unpaid fines and/or summonses in excess of the amounts set forth in subsection (d) of this section, which summonses or fines shall be cleared by the owner or operator by payment through cash, money order, debit card, or credit card before said vehicle is released. 
(b)  Applicability of section-Generally. The provisions of this section shall apply only to those streets, highways, and alleys on which there have been posted official "No Parking" or "No Stopping" or like signs with the same meaning, or as to those portions of streets and highways officially designated as bus stops, or to vehicles doubled parked, or to vehicles parked in violation of regulations under Section 20-90 or this chapter. 
    This regulation shall, however, apply to wrecked or abandoned vehicles wherever the same may be found and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. The term "abandoned vehicles," as used in Sections 20-121 through 20-127, shall have the following meanings: 
(1)  Any vehicle which obstructs the flow of traffic on a street or highway or in alleys, or in front of, or from, or in driveways, provided, however, that where the obstruction of traffic flow is in or from a private driveway into a street or highway, the police department must receive a complaint as to the alleged "abandoned vehicle" and have the same on file before initiating any action to tow away such offending vehicle; and 
(2)  Any vehicle parked in an area designated as a "No Parking" area, but which has not been designated as a "Tow-Away" area, when the offending vehicle has been so parked for a period of 24 hours or more, or in a limited parking area for a period of at least 48 hours, or any place else on a street, highway, or alley for a continuous period of at least seven consecutive days; and 
(3)  Any vehicle parked upon a street or highway not capable of being moved under its own power, or with deflated tires, or without current license tags; provided, however, no action shall be taken with regard to any parked vehicle less than 15 days after the expiration date designated on the license tag. 
(c)  Same-Signs, etc., required in certain areas. The provisions of this section shall be operative as to "No Parking" or "No Stopping" areas only when notice of the provisions of this regulation shall be given by appropriate signs or markings, advising that vehicles parked in violation of any law, provisions of this chapter, ordinance or regulation as aforesaid, may be towed away in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
    Any vehicle parked on a street or highway in a zone marked "Tow Away" shall be subjected to immediate immobilization or removal from that location. 
(d)  The alderman's court for the city (hereinafter court) shall provide to the police department the license registration numbers of motor vehicles which have outstanding and overdue traffic citations (summons) issued to such motor vehicle for violations incurred under the motor vehicle laws of the State of Delaware, Title 21, Delaware Code, as amended, or Chapter 20 of the Code of the City of Newark, or any law of the state or any ordinance of the city or provision of the city code or regulation issued by the city manager and/or police department, and which summonses total $75.00 or more in unpaid fines and costs and/or five or more unpaid traffic summonses. 
    Once a vehicle has summonses totaling $75.00 or more in unpaid fines and costs and/or five or more unpaid traffic summonses, all fines and costs must be discharged in the court either by way of payment of all fines and costs assessed thereon or by other action of the court, or, if any such vehicle is found on the streets of the city, it shall be immobilized or towed and impounded as provided in paragraph (a). Any vehicle so immobilized or impounded shall not be released to its lawful owner, any provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, until all unpaid traffic summons issued to such vehicle have been discharged in the court either by payment of all fines and costs assessed thereon or by action of the court. The owner of such immobilized motor vehicle shall redeem it only on payment of the sum of $75.00 for the costs of immobilizing and releasing such vehicle and shall sign a receipt for such vehicle. The owner of an immobilized vehicle that was subsequently towed and impounded shall be subject to a fee of $75.00 plus an additional fee for towing and storage. 
    The owner of such impounded motor vehicle shall redeem it only on payment for the costs of towing and releasing such vehicle and shall sign a receipt for such vehicle. Payment for such towing shall be in accordance with the towing costs outlined in the current agreement between the city and its towing contractor. In the event payment is made under protest, bail bond for further appearance shall be posted as required by the Alderman's Court. The provisions of paragraph (a) relating to an owner or person in charge of being willing, if present, to remove such vehicle before being towed shall not apply to violations under paragraph (d). 
(e)  In any case involving immobilization of a vehicle pursuant to this section, the police officer or parking enforcement officer shall place on such vehicle, in a conspicuous manner, notice sufficient to warn any individual that such vehicle has been immobilized and that any attempt to move such vehicle might result in damage to such vehicle. 
(f)  Any vehicle remaining immobilized and not released for 48 hours may be towed and impounded at the direction of a police officer or parking enforcement officer. 
(g)  It shall be unlawful for any person to tow any immobilized vehicle except at the specific direction of the city manager or the police department. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove an immobilization device. It shall further be unlawful for a person in possession of an immobilization device to retain it and not to return it promptly to the police department. In any instance in which an immobilization device has been removed other than by or at the direction of the city manager or the police department, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of the motor vehicle is responsible for the missing or stolen immobilization device. Any violation of this section constituting an unlawful towing of an immobilized vehicle, or an unlawful removal of an immobilization device, or a failure to return to the city any immobilization device that has been removed from a motor vehicle, shall be punishable upon conviction by a fine in an amount of not less than $250.00 plus court costs. For a second and subsequent conviction for any of the offenses enumerated herein, there shall be a fine of not less than $500.00 plus court costs.

If the property be of the kind for which a certificate of title or registration shall or should have been issued by any commissioner, commission or department, whether state or federal, the city manager, or his designee, shall cause notice by registered mail to be sent at least ten days prior to the sale to the owner and lienholder, if any, shown on the records of such commissioner, commission or department or to the person entitled to the possession thereof, if his address be known, or if it can be ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence; and if said address cannot be so ascertained, then such notice shall not be required to be given.

(Ord. No. 08-13, Amend. No. 1, 6-23-08) 
Sec. 22-97. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm coordinator means a person or persons designated by the chief of the Newark Police Department to administer, control and review false alarm reduction efforts and administer the provisions of this section. 
    Alarm installation company means a person or entity in the business of selling, providing, maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving or installing an alarm system at an alarm site. 
    Alarm dispatch request means a notification to the Newark Police Department that an alarm, either manual or automatic, has been activated at a particular alarm site. 
    Alarm registration means authorization granted by the alarm coordinator to an alarm user to operate an alarm system. 
    Alarm site means a single fixed premises or location served by an alarm system or systems. Each unit, if served by a separate alarm system in a multi-unit building or complex, shall be considered a separate alarm site, 
    Alarm system means a device or series of devices, including, but not limited to, hardwired systems and systems interconnected with a radio frequency method such as cellular or private radio signals, which emit or transmit a remote or local audible, visual or electronic signal indicating an alarm condition and intended to summon the Newark Police Department, including local alarm systems. "Alarm system" does not include an alarm installed in a vehicle or on someone's person unless the vehicle or the personal alarm is permanently located at a site. 
    Alarm user means any person or entity, who or which has contracted for monitoring, repair, installation or maintenance service from an alarm installation company or monitoring company for an alarm system, or who or which owns or operates an alarm system which is not monitored, maintained or repaired under contract. 
    Arming station means a device that allows control of an alarm system. 
    Automatic voice dialer means any electrical, electronic, mechanical, or other device capable of being programmed to send a prerecorded voice message, when activated, over a telephone line, radio or other communication system, to the Newark Police Department, a public safety or emergency services agency requesting dispatch. 
    Cancellation means the process whereby response is terminated when a monitoring company (designated by the alarm user) for the alarm site notifies the responding law enforcement agency that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring a Newark Police Department response after an alarm dispatch request. 
    Conversion means the transaction or process by which one alarm installation company or monitoring company begins the servicing and/or monitoring of a previously unmonitored alarm system or an alarm system previously serviced and/or monitored by another alarm company. 
    Disability means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life actions. 
    Duress alarm means a silent alarm system signal generated by the entry of a designated code into an arming station in order to signal that the alarm user is being forced to turn off the system and requires a Newark Police Department response. 
    False alarm means an alarm dispatch request to the Newark Police Department, when no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response exists. This definition includes signals activated by negligence, accident, mechanical failure, and electrical failure; signals activated intentionally in non-emergency situations; and signals for which the actual cause of activation is unknown. There is a rebuttable presumption that an alarm is false if personnel responding from the Newark Police Department do not discover any evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal activity, or other emergency after following normal police procedures in investigating the incident. An alarm is not false if the alarm user proves that: 
(1)  An individual activated the alarm based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response existed; 
(2)  The alarm system was activated by lightning or an electrical surge that caused physical damage to the system; or 
(3)  If the alarm user experienced a power outage of four or more hours, causing the alarm to activate upon restoration of power, as evidenced by written documentation provided by Delmarva Power or other applicable provider. 
    Holdup alarm means a silent alarm signal generated by the manual activation of a device intended to signal a robbery in progress. 
    Local alarm system means any alarm system, which is not monitored, that annunciates an alarm only at the alarm site. 
    Monitoring means the process by which a monitoring company receives signals from an alarm system and relays an alarm dispatch request to the Newark Police Department for the purpose of summoning law enforcement to the alarm site. 
    One plus duress alarm means the manual activation of a silent alarm signal by entering at an arming station a code that adds one to the last digit of the normal arm/disarm code (e.g. normal code = 1234, one plus duress code = 1235). 
    Panic alarm means an audible alarm system signal generated by the manual activation of a device intended to signal a life-threatening or emergency situation requiring Newark Police Department response. 
    Person means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, organization or similar entity. 
    Responder means an individual capable of reaching the alarm site within thirty (30) minutes and having access to the alarm site, the code to the alarm system, and the authority to approve repairs to the alarm system. 
    Takeover means the transaction or process by which an alarm user takes over control of an existing alarm system, which was previously controlled by another alarm user. 
    Verify means an attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site by telephonic or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. 
    Zones means division of the area served by an alarm system so as to indicate the general location from which an alarm system signal is transmitted.

Application and a fee for each system shall be filed with the coordinator's office for each calendar year. The registration fee for a burglary alarm system is $10.00. If the system includes a panic or robbery alarm, an additional fee of $10.00 is required. Applications for an alarm registration of less than one calendar year duration may be filed with the required fee prorated on a quarterly basis. Failure to submit a timely application will be classified as use of a non-registered alarm system and citations and penalties shall be assessed without waiver. If a residential alarm user is over the age of 65, or has a disability, or has been awarded funds for the installation of an alarm system by the Delaware Victim's Compensation Assistance program and is the primary resident of a residence where no business is conducted, alarm registration may be obtained without the payment of a registration fee. 
(b)  Upon receipt of a completed alarm registration application form and registration fee, the alarm coordinator shall register the applicant unless the applicant has: 
(1)  Failed to pay a fine assessed under this section; or 
(2)  Had an alarm registration for the alarm site suspended and the violation causing the suspension or revocation has not been corrected. 
(c)  Each alarm registration application must include the following information: 
(1)  The name, complete address (including apartment/suite number) and telephone numbers of the person who will be the registration holder and be responsible for the proper maintenance and operation of the alarm system;

(4)  Mailing address, if different from the address of the alarm site; 
(5)  Any dangerous or special conditions present at the alarm site;

c.  The name, address, and telephone number of the monitoring company if different from the alarm installation company; 
d.  That a set of written operating instructions for the alarm system, including written guidelines on how to avoid false alarms, has been left with the applicant by the alarm installation company; and 
e.  That the alarm installation company has trained the applicant in proper use of the alarm system, including instructions on how to avoid false alarms. 
(9)  Acknowledgment that the Newark Police Department response may be influenced by factors including, but not limited to, the availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels, etc. 
(10)  An alarm user required by federal, state, or municipal statute, regulation, rule, or ordinance to install, maintain, and operate an alarm system shall be subject to this article, provided: 
a.  The alarm registration shall be designated a "special alarm registration"; 
b.  A special alarm registration for a system which has seven or more false alarms in a calendar year shall not be subject to suspension under Section 22-102; 
c.  For each false alarm over three in a permit year, upon written demand thereof by the chief of police, the user of an alarm system operated under a special alarm registration shall pay the penalty specified in Subsection 22-102(b); 
d.  The payment of any penalty provided for in subparagraphs b. and c. of this paragraph shall not be deemed to extend the term of the permit. 
(d)  Any false statement of a material fact made by an applicant for the purpose of obtaining an alarm registration shall be sufficient cause for refusal to issue or revocation of a registration. 
(e)  An alarm registration cannot be transferred to another person or alarm site. An alarm user shall inform the alarm administrator of any change that alters any of the information listed on the alarm registration application within five business days of such change. 
(Ord. No. 08-13, Amend. No. 1, 6-23-08; Ord. No. 09-17, Amend. No. 1, 4-27-09; Ord. No. 13-08, Amend. No. 2, 4-22-13) 
Sec. 22-99. - Duties of the alarm user. 
(a)  An alarm user shall: 
(1)  Maintain the alarm site and the alarm system in a manner that will minimize or eliminate false alarms; 
(2)  Make every reasonable effort to have a responder to the alarm system's location within 30 minutes when requested by a Newark Police Department order to: 
a.  Deactivate an alarm system; 
b.  Provide access to the alarm site; and/or 
c.  Provide alternative security for the alarm site. 
(3)  Not activate an alarm system for any reason other than an occurrence of an event that the alarm system was intended to report. 
(b)  An alarm user shall adjust the mechanism or cause the mechanism to be adjusted so that an alarm signal audible on the exterior of an alarm site will sound for no longer than ten minutes after being activated. 
    If the alarm continues to be audible for a period of one hour or more and no emergency situation is then apparent, the Newark Police Department shift supervisor may direct a Newark Police Officer, other city employee, or private contractor under police department supervision to enter the premises and disconnect the alarm. A service fee shall be assessed against the alarm user in the sum of $100.00 for each time the system is required to be disconnected by the police department pursuant to this section. The alarm user shall also reimburse the police department for expenses reasonably incurred during the entry and the securing of said premises. Further, the alarm registration for any alarm disconnected pursuant to this section shall be considered suspended and will not be reactivated unless and until the user submits proof to the alarm coordinator that the user has corrected the system and the alarm coordinator authorizes the re-activation. 
(c)  An alarm user shall have a licensed company inspect the alarm system after two false alarms in a 12-month period. The alarm coordinator may waive a required inspection if it determines that a false alarm(s) could not have been related to a defect or malfunction in the alarm system. 
(d)  An alarm user shall not use automatic voice dialers. 
(e)  An alarm user shall maintain, at each alarm site, a set of written operating instructions for each alarm system.

(2)  The coordinator may adjust the count of false alarms based on: 
a.  Evidence that a false alarm was caused by an act of God; 
b.  Evidence that a false alarm was caused by action of the telephone company;

(3)  The registration of an alarm is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response by Newark Police Department to an alarm dispatch request. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law shall remain in full force and effect. By registering an alarm, the alarm user acknowledges that law enforcement response may be influenced by factors such as: the availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels and prior false alarm history. 
(b)  Penalties. 
(1)  Each violation of this section shall be penalized as follows: 
a.  For the fourth false alarm within a twelve-month period, by a penalty of $100.00.

(2)  In addition, any person operating a non-registered alarm system will be subject to a penalty of $50.00 for each false alarm in addition to any other penalties. The alarm coordinator may waive this additional civil penalty for a non-registered system if the alarm user submits an application for alarm registration within ten days after notification of such violation. 
(c)  Cancellation. If cancellation occurs prior to the Newark Police Department arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of civil penalties, and no civil penalties will be assessed. 
(d)  Notification. The alarm coordinator shall notify the alarm user in writing after each false alarm. The notification shall include the amount of the fine for the false alarm and a description of the appeals procedure available to the alarm user. 
(e)  Suspension of registration.

(3)  The hearing shall be before the city alderman or deputy alderman, and the coordinator and the alarm user shall have the right to present written and oral evidence subject to the right of cross-examination. If the alderman determines that four or more false alarms have occurred in a permit year, the alderman shall issue written findings to that effect and an order affirming the appropriate penalty. 
(4)  If the alarm user does not pay the assessed penalty or request a hearing within the 20-day period, the coordinator shall give notice by certified mail to the user that the registration shall be suspended without further notice on the tenth day after the date of notice if the user does not pay the penalty within that period. 
(5)  If a request for a hearing is not made within the 20-day period, the action of the coordinator is final. 
(6)  Filing of a request for hearing shall stay the action by the coordinator requiring payment of a penalty, until the city alderman conducts the hearing and issues written findings. 
(7)  Nothing herein shall: 
a.  Preclude the Newark Police Department from responding to duress, holdup or panic alarms, calls describing emergencies or crimes in progress, or routine calls for service; 
b.  Limit the Newark Police Department from issuing violation notices for false alarms; or 
c.  Be construed to create a duty to respond in any circumstances where such a duty does not exist pursuant to the statutory or common law of Delaware. 
(g)  Restoration of registration to suspended locations. To restore the registration to an alarm site, the alarm user must submit a written report from a licensed alarm installation company certifying that the alarm system has been inspected, and repaired if required, and that it is functioning properly, or submit alarm registration information, as applicable. In addition, the alarm user must pay all outstanding penalties. 
(Ord. No. 08-13, Amend. No. 1, 6-23-08) 
Sec. 22-103. - Enforcement; confidentiality; government immunity.

(b)  In the interest of public safety, all information contained in and gathered through the alarm registration applications shall be held in confidence by all employees or representatives of the city. 
(c)  Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law shall remain in full force and effect. By applying for an alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges that responses by the Newark Police Department may be influenced by factors such as: the availability of police units, priority of call, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels and prior response history.

Formerly, said section pertained to sewer service charges applicable to citizens of the age of 65 years or older and/or who are disabled, and was derived from Ord. No. 76-37, Amend. No. 1, adopted July 26, 1976. 
Sec. 25-19. - Sanitary sewer service charge; adjustment for water not reaching public sewer; conditions. 
    In the event the owner of property subject to the sanitary sewer service charge makes a written application to the city manager requesting an exemption of part of the sanitary sewer service charge because a portion of the water consumed on any real property connected to the sewerage system does not reach public sanitary sewer, such request shall be granted by the city manager provided that the owner so requesting: 
(a)  Arranges with the city and pays the necessary cost to have one or more additional separate water meters installed, so that one or more water meters will measure only the water consumed on the real estate and subject to the service charge; 
(b)  Rearranges the water piping, if necessary, on the property, so that it is physically impossible to interconnect the water piping, for the water to be exempt from sanitary sewer service charge with the water piping carrying water which would reach the sewer; 
(c)  Gives the building official the right to enter the property at any time during working hours to make an inspection to determine that the water piping is properly disconnected and that no subsequent interconnections have been made. 
    An annual inspection charge of $5.00 per year shall be charged for each and every meter measuring water to be exempted. 
(Code 1959, Ch. 18, § 24) 
Sec. 25-20. - Sanitary sewer service charge applicable 90 days after sewerage system available to unconnected property.

(Ord. No. 17-34, Amend. No. 1, 10-9-17) 
Sec. 25A-2. - Stormwater charges. 
(a)  The stormwater charge represents an equitable system for recovering costs related to all aspects of stormwater management, including but not limited to: capital improvements including debt service; operation and maintenance costs including routine replacements; compliance with all current and future stormwater and surface water regulatory requirements; surface water quality monitoring, inspection, management and improvement projects; flooding mitigation; inspections of stormwater management facilities; billing and administration; plan review and inspection of sediment control and stormwater management plans and practices; acquisition of interests in land including easements; and watershed planning and protection initiatives. 
(b)  All parcels that are within the city's corporate boundaries shall be assessed a monthly stormwater charge as per the provisions of this article. 
(c)  The stormwater charge for each parcel shall be determined as per the provisions of this article, based on the number of equivalent stormwater units "ESUs" and the ESU rate. The ESU, the ESU rate and the single-family residential tiers may be amended by city council by ordinance. 
(d)  Equivalent stormwater unit. The equivalent stormwater unit is 1,620 square feet. 
(e)  Equivalent stormwater unit monthly rate. The equivalent stormwater unit monthly rate is $3.54. 
(f)  The stormwater charge for the various stormwater classes shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Single-family residential stormwater classes. For the single-family residential stormwater classes, a four-tiered stormwater charge is established to accommodate the wide range of impervious area square footage that exists among the single-family residential parcels in the city. The four tiers of impervious area and the stormwater charge for each tier are as shown in Table 1: 
Table 1: Single-Family Residential Parcels

The impervious area for each residential parcel is determined based on the actual main floor, attached area, and detached structure square footage data provided by the county's tax assessment system. Based on the impervious area determined, the residential parcels are assigned to one of the four tiers of impervious area. The PWWR shall assign a tier to each single-family residential parcel. A stormwater charge will be assessed monthly based on the assigned ESU ratio and ESU rate. In the event of a newly constructed single-family residential dwelling, the PWWR shall assign a tier and ESU ratio upon issuance of the certificate of occupancy for that dwelling and upon recording of the parcel attributes in New Castle County's Department of Land Use records. 
(2)  Condominium stormwater class. The stormwater charge for a condominium shall be the calculated ESU factor multiplied by the ESU rate. The PWWR shall calculate an ESU factor based on the estimated impervious area and the information in New Castle County's Department of Land Use records. 
(3)  All other stormwater classes. The stormwater charge for all other storm water classes shall be the calculated ESU factor multiplied by the ESU rate. The PWWR shall calculate an ESU factor based on the estimated impervious area. The impervious area will be estimated by applying the runoff factors set forth in Table 2, to a parcel's gross parcel area, based on the information in New Castle County's Department of Land Use records.

    The following land planning policies shall serve as a basis for guiding the subdivision of land through the regulations and procedures that follow for property within the corporate limits of the city: 
(a)  Comprehensive planning. All subdivision and development of land shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the goals and purposes of the comprehensive development plan. 
(b)  Utilities and city services. Subdivision plans shall provide adequately for utilities. Extensions of city utilities shall be made under conditions which will safeguard or enhance the city's enhance the city's investments based upon estimates of annual net revenue returns. Consideration shall be given to minimizing municipal costs for all city services, while, at the same time, ensuring that city services can be adequately and appropriately provided.

(d)  Storm water, floodplains, and wetlands. Subdivision plans shall contain storm water and drainage provisions and conform to the wetlands and floodplain requirements of this chapter and Chapter 32, Zoning, as well as all applicable state and federal regulations. 
(e)  Streets and roadways. All streets and circulation patterns on subdivision plans shall provide for safe, efficient and convenient movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and adequate parking. The internal circulation system should promote and encourage increased bicycle use and pedestrian movement among residential, commercial, and other land uses. Stub streets or street rights-of-way may be required on subdivision plans to permit future access to interior parcels. Consideration shall be given to excluding heavy vehicular and truck traffic from residential areas. 
(f)  Site design. 
(1)  General. The subdivision plan shall conform to the highest principles of land planning and design, and shall be evaluated on the basis of the overall suitability in the context of the neighborhood within which the land to be subdivided is a part so that land planning for the area may be properly conducted and a rational pattern of development attained. 
(2)  Conservation and natural resources. Appropriate consideration shall be given to the preservation of existing vegetation, minimizing cut and fill operations, avoidance of erosion and the resultant siltation of streams, rivers, and drainage ways, and other pertinent conservation measures. Construction and building on properties with slopes exceeding 25 percent shall not be permitted. Construction and building on properties with slopes exceeding 15 percent to 25 percent shall be permitted only with the approval of the public works director, upon consideration of the geological, hydrological, and soil conditions of the site. The minimum horizontal dimension of steep slope that is subject to this regulation is 30 feet. 
(3)  Landscaping. Landscaping, or other screening, shall be sited to reduce the impact of light, glare, dust, noise, and vibration generated by transportation, industrial, or commercial uses on adjacent residential communities, and to enhance the aesthetic value of all new development in the city, as provided in Chapter 32, Zoning, Article XXV. 
(4)  Lot layout. Awkward and irrationally shaped lots and patterns of lots should be avoided. Excessive acute angle intersections of lot lines with rights-of-way should be avoided. All lots must front on a street. Flag lots, defined as lots or parcels not directly fronting on a street right-of-way, but connected to a right-of-way by a narrow strip of land, shall not be permitted; flag lots, however, may be permitted when the minimum lot area for the flag lot has at least two times the lot areas required in the zoning district within which the lot is located, as specified in Chapter 32, Zoning, and where the topography or special conditions are such that it would not reasonably allow the traditional lot pattern of parcels fronting directly on a street right-of-way. For approved flag lots, access must be via fee simple ownership on the street right-of-way. 
(5)  Building location. Residential buildings shall be located and spaced so that adequate privacy is provided. Required yards, as specified in Chapter 32, Zoning, shall be measured perpendicular from the buildings.

APPENDIX III. - DRAINAGE CODE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Cross reference- Drainage swales and ditches, Ch. 26, Art. VI. 

Section I. - In general. 
(a)  Objective. The objective of both Appendices III and IV is to develop a comprehensive set of regulations and controls covering surface and groundwater drainage in the city in order: 
(1)  To protect persons and property from serious harm and significant damage from flooding caused by storms of up to one hundred-year intensity; 
(2)  To assure that each residential, commercial, industrial, or public development, home, and yard is constructed with adequate drainage; 
(3)  To provide that public drainage facilities and watercourses are designed and constructed to require minimal maintenance; 
(4)  To preserve water quality of the streams and natural watercourses in Newark; 
(5)  To minimize sedimentation and erosion; 
(6)  To promote delayed runoff by requiring the use of on-site detention/retention; and 
(7)  To promote the utilization of groundwater recharge techniques where feasible. 
(8)  To enable the City of Newark to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and applicable regulations for stormwater discharges (40 CFR 122.26, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. and Title 7, Del. C., § 6003). 
(9)  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). 
(b)  Liability of city. Nothing in this appendix shall create any liability for loss for damage resulting from the failure of the city to perform any responsibility stated in this appendix or obligate the city to make any appropriation or to expend any money not appropriated for any purpose stated in this appendix. 
(c)  [Conformance.] Whenever a sediment and/or stormwater management plan is required by the public works department, the plans shall conform to the most current Delaware Sediment and Stormwater Regulations pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and city regulations. 
(d)  Additional information and related requirements. For additional information and related applicable state requirements, see the most current "Delaware Sediment and Storm Water Regulations" issued by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), and as may be amended by the DNREC, are hereby adopted by the City of Newark as if fully set forth herein. 
(e)  Land-disturbing activities. Except as exempted in the Delaware Sediment and Stormwater Regulations, no person or entity shall engage in any land-disturbing activity in the city until such person or entity has submitted and obtained approval for a sediment and stormwater permit. All sediment and stormwater plans submitted for permit approval shall conform with the requirements of the most current Delaware Sediment and Stormwater Regulations, and any amendments thereto, and city regulations. 
(f)  Reserved. 
(g)  Standard requirements. The guidelines established in Appendix III and IV are minimum requirements. The public works director may require more stringent requirements in certain situations based on historical drainage, flooding problems, preservation of environmentally sensitive areas, or based on site specific circumstance. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 2, 5-23-05; Ord. No. 17-05, Amend. No. 2, 2-13-17) 
Section II. - Watercourse maintenance. 
(a)  Responsibility. 
(1)  It is the responsibility of the city to keep all major streams in Newark, open and free flowing. Each owner of property containing a minor stream(s) shall keep any stream on their property open and free flowing. 
(2)  Maintenance of "on-street" drainage facilities for public dedicated or owned streets and roads to the point of open discharge is the responsibility of the city once inspected and accepted. Maintenance of private property after the point of open discharge is the responsibility of the property owner. 
(3)  Maintenance of all drainage facilities and watercourses within any subdivision is the responsibility of the developer until the subdivision is accepted by the city, after which they become the responsibility of the city, the community maintenance association, or the adjacent property owners. 
(4)  The city may agree to accept a water body, which is contained within the tract being subdivided, through dedication. If dedication of the water body or portion thereof is unacceptable to the city, the lot line shall be drawn so as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the adjacent lots. The city council may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not become the responsibility of the city. No more than 25% of the minimum lot area or related zoning code requirements may be satisfied by land under water. Where a watercourse or water body separates the buildable area of a lot from access to a street right-of-way, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure approved by the public works director. 
(5)  For each development, a drainage agreement shall be executed before any building permits are issued. A sample drainage agreement is found in Section VII(a) Exhibit 1. 
(6)  The enforcement section of this agreement shall include the following steps to be taken by the city to enforce the agreement: 
a.  A written notice is to be sent from the director of public works to the builder stating that he is not complying with the agreement and that he must do the work agreed upon before a certain date. This date is determined by the director of public works. 
b.  If the builder does not comply with the agreement by the date specified in the notice, the city shall immediately refuse to issue any more building permits for the development. Furthermore, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any houses under construction as of the date specified in the notice. 
c.  If the builder does not take steps to comply with the agreement before 30 calendar days after the date specified in the notice, the city shall then issue "stop work orders" on all active building permits the builder has in the city. 
d.  Simultaneously with step (c), above, the city or its agent shall perform any construction work required to attain compliance with the drainage agreement. 
e.  Upon completion of the work, the builder will be required to reimburse the city for the cost of this work, plus an annual interest of 12%. If the builder fails to reimburse the city on a timely basis, the city will place a lien on any bond or insurance so created for this purpose. If there is no bond or insurance, a lien shall be placed on the property. 
f.  If the city is subsequently reimbursed for the drainage work done, any stop work orders or liens will be rescinded. 
(7)  Maintenance of any drainage facility, stormwater management structure, or watercourse originating and partially or completely on private property is the responsibility of the owner to the point of open discharge at the property line or at a communal watercourse within the property or the point of piped discharge into a closed communal system which has been accepted by the city or communal watercourse. 
(8)  It is the responsibility of any person, corporation, or other entity doing any act on or across a communal stream or watercourse or upon the floodplain or right-of-way thereof to maintain as nearly as possible, in its present state, the stream, watercourse, floodplain, or right-of-way during the pendency of the activity and to return it to its original or equal condition after such activity is completed. 
(9)  Maintenance of streams, watercourses, and drainage facilities shall consist of keeping them open and free flowing. 
(b)  Prohibitions. 
(1)  No person, corporation, or other entity shall block, impede the flow of, alter, construct any structure, or deposit any material or thing, or commit any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any communal stream or watercourse without having obtained prior approval therefore from the department of public works. 
(2)  Whoever shall block, impede, or cause to be blocked or impeded, the normal or flood flow of any stream or drainage ditch in the city shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than $100.00 and not more than $1,000.00 for each violation. Each day during which such blockage or impeding of flow continues shall be deemed a separate offense. 
(3)  Whoever shall alter, or cause to be altered, the course or in any way change or cause to be changed any stream or drainage ditch or normal flood flow without first having obtained approval from the director of public works shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than $100.00 and not more $1,000.00 for each violation. Each day during which such altered course or change in stream or drainage ditch shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense. 
Prior to granting such approval, the director of public works shall consider, but not limit his/her considerations to, such items as the effect of such change or alteration on the stream's groundwater recharge capability, loss or erosion resistance, destruction of natural habitat, organisms and stream supported and oriented life, and increased stream flow velocity. 
(4)  Whoever shall place or cause to be placed rubbish, debris, trash, grass cuttings, weeds, or waste materials in any stream, drainage ditch, or on the floodplain of any stream or drainage ditch shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than $100.00 and not more than $1,000.00 for each violation. Each day during which such rubbish, debris, trash, grass cuttings, weeds, or waste materials shall remain in any stream or drainage ditch shall be deemed a separate offense. 
(c)  Design for maintenance. 
(1)  New or improved watercourses or drainage facilities will be designed and constructed to allow for economical maintenance, and improvements to watercourses in existing developments will be designed and constructed to retain the character of the surrounding area as much as practical. 
(2)  Open watercourses are preferred to closed systems. 
(3)  Adequate right-of-way must be provided for access of persons and equipment during construction and afterwards for maintenance. 
(4)  Easements and rights-of-way. 
a.  All on-site drainage easements necessitated either by approved drainage design for subdivision or alterations to natural watercourses will be sized and laid out according to the requirements of this appendix. 
b.  All easements will be dedicated by the developer or parties making the alterations and recorded by the procedures which are established by the city subdivision regulations. 
c.  Rights-of-way or easements necessary for storm drainage on-site of the proposed developments must be provided by the developer. Easements off-site which pertain to natural watercourses and/or major streams will be provided by the city if necessary. The width shall be such as to permit the movement and normal operation of equipment which is necessary for the repair and maintenance of these facilities under day-to-day living conditions. 
d.  Within subdivisions where pipes are located on private lands, a drainage easement should be provided of no less than 20 feet in width, and suitable allowance for swale construction over the pipe must be made. The owner shall not construct any structure within the drainage easement or place within the easement any blockage. If drainage swales are designed along property lines of private property, those areas shall be maintained by abutting property owners. 
e.  Streams which flow through or along the boundaries of developments shall have dedicated right-of-way of a width not less than the area estimated to be flooded by a 100 year frequency storm after grading. However, in no case shall the width of dedicated right-of-way be less than 50 feet if the drainage area is in excess of 100 acres. (Any grading in the area of the 100-year floodplain shall be accomplished in compliance with provisions of Section III, Floodplains.) 
f.  Off-site easements necessary to ensure proper discharge and unimpeded flow to natural watercourses must be obtained in accordance with the provisions of this section. Copies of these easements shall be provided to the department of public works and/or shown on the final plat. 
g.  Besides the above requirements, the developer will be required to provide a permanent recorded access easement to all on-site easements required by the above paragraphs. These access easements, where possible, should be across individual lots of the subdivision. This access easement will be at least ten feet wide so that equipment and material can be easily moved in and out without damage to private adjacent properties. 
(5)  When it is necessary to make permanent improvements to provide adequate drainage systems for existing subdivisions, the same criteria for establishing new easements will be followed as in paragraph (4) above. 
(6)  Where it is necessary to make capital improvements or maintenance work on a watercourse in the city, which is not part of the subdivision, the same policy for establishing new easements will be followed as in paragraph (4) above. The width of the easement will consist of the course bed and slopes plus a 30-foot strip adjacent to the stream not including the slopes of both sides. If only one strip can be provided, a minimum of 40 feet will be required. Access to the maintenance strips must be provided and will be of the same type as described in paragraph (4) above. 
On small watercourses, when the above requirements place an undue hardship on the landowners, these can be waived by the director of public works or his designee and a suitable size easement will be provided. The alignment of the easement will generally be governed by the hydraulic characteristics of the stream flow and the location and relationship of the adjacent properties. The alignment should follow a natural watercourse when possible. 
(7)  When capital improvements are made along reaches of major streams such as the White Clay, and Christina, or any of their minor streams, the easements will be sized and located on an individual basis with direct consultation with the director of public works. 
(8)  Easements for other drainage facilities which are not specifically mentioned in the previous sections will be sized and located on an individual basis with such aid from the department of public works as is necessary to provide an adequate easement. 
(d)  Riparian buffer protection requirements. Because the preservation of Newark's streams and stream banks in an undisturbed natural condition constitutes important physical, aesthetic, recreational, water quality, health, and economic assets for our community, new construction in subdivisions approved after the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this Section derives shall comply with the following: 
(1)  In addition to conformance with the city zoning code, article XXVI, special provisions for floodplains and land adjoining floodplains, plans shall show all perennial watercourses identified through site inspection and labeled on United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps with a solid blue line (known as "blue line" streams). 
(2)  Within a 50-foot buffer area, measured from the top of the banks of the blue line streams and from 50 feet from beyond the special flood hazard area (SFHA), formerly known as the open floodway district (OFD), as designated in zoning code, chapter 32, the land shall be managed to enhance and maximize the value of the stream channel and water resources by prohibiting the following, except for uses permitted and regulated in city zoning code article XXVI, special provisions for floodplains and land adjoining floodplains. 
(a)  Clearing of existing trees and vegetation, except: for selective pruning that does not compromise vegetation; removal of individual trees that are diseased or may cause disease; removal of trees and vegetation that are in danger of causing damage to structures or municipal facilities, or that otherwise may jeopardize public safety; and removal of poison ivy and similar vegetation. 
(b)  Soil disturbance by grading, stripping or similar practices, including alteration of the course of the stream. 
(c)  Filling or dumping. 
(3)  These requirements do not apply to culverts unless the stream is removed from the culvert as part of the subdivision plan. 
(4)  Stream restoration and stabilization approved by the public works director is permitted. 
(5)  The buffer area restrictions established herein shall not apply to area and related requirements, nor uses permitted in the underlying zoning district adjacent to the buffer area, as specified in the city zoning code. 
(6)  Subject to the approval of the city, the buffer area restrictions established herein shall not apply to the construction or maintenance of public utilities and facilities including, but not limited to, transmission lines, roads, drainage, water, wastewater, and similar facilities. 
(7)  The public works director, in consultation with the parks and recreation director, shall require a buffer area management plan through the construction improvement plan review process. This plan shall consist of descriptions of existing vegetation and a landscape plan for proposed new plantings. The requirement for new plantings may be waived only in instances where the existing stand of trees is sufficiently wide and in such good condition to function as a riparian buffer as specified in this subsection.

Section III. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 15-02, Amend. No. 6, adopted January 12, 2015, repealed the former section III in its entirety, which pertained to floodplains, and derived from Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 2, adopted May 23, 2005. 
Section IV. - Developments; watercourses design requirements. 
(a)  Definition. "Drainage areas" are those areas whose surface runoff is collected into a common natural watercourse. 
    For the purpose of clarification of the use of terms in this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
(1)  Bridge: Any structure without a paved invert or any structure of which the superstructure is not structurally integrated with the substructure. 
(2)  Culvert: Any structure not included in the bridge definition. These normally are structures of which all structural elements are integrated into a closed unit such as pipes, box culverts, and rigid frames with paved inverts. 
(b)  Sizing. 
(1)  Whenever any surface change is approved within a drainage area, the drainage facilities and easements within that development shall be sized and designed consistent with an integrated drainage system serving the entire drainage area when fully developed in accordance with the General Comprehensive Development Plan for Newark. The city shall make available all information it deems necessary to design an integrated drainage system. 
For projects requiring stormwater management approval, developers shall include stormwater management and drainage computations as stipulated in Appendix IV, Section I(a) and (b). 
(2)  The peak rate of runoff normally shall be calculated by the rational formula, TR55, TR20, or HEC1 (use of alternate methods of computing the peak rate of runoff may be specifically approved or required on a case-by-case basis by the public works director): 
a.  All closed storm drainage conveyance systems shall be designed and constructed according to Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) standards unless exceeded by design criteria under this section. Reference is made to the State of Delaware Department of Transportation, Division of Highways, Rules and Regulations for Subdivision Streets, Section 7, Drainage Criteria, and any amendments, thereto. 
(3)  Conveyance system design frequencies. 
a.  Storm sewer installations going to the site, or on the site as required for development to handle stormwater runoff, shall be designed using the 10-year storm frequency. The 25-year storm frequency shall be used for sump areas drained by a storm piping system, to open discharge. 
b.  All natural water courses shall be preserved on the site as close to its natural state unless there are circumstances applicable to the site such that the strict adherence to the provisions of the regulation will result in unnecessary hardship. The conversion of a natural watercourse through the site or along the boundary of the site to an enclosed conveyance system shall be designed using the 50-year storm frequency. This design shall include an enclosed system in combination with a swale or other conveyance system able to carry the 100-year storm frequency without negative impact to adjacent property. 
c.  Wherever open channels (ditches/swales) are proposed for the conveyance system, the capacity design shall be a 25-year storm frequency, except that a higher storm frequency design may be required as directed by the public works director to address potential flooding or conveyance issues. 
(4)  Bridges and culverts. 
a.  Culverts or bridges transversing a natural watercourse running through the site or along the boundary of the site, or open channels replacing a watercourse, shall be designed for the 50-year storm frequency with a 100-year flooding easement. 
b.  All structures installed to convey surface flows which are not under DelDOT's jurisdiction shall be sized in accordance with this section to carry the peak runoff from the contributing watershed without causing flood damage to upstream properties or erosion damage to downstream properties. 
c.  The acceptable design method for sizing both bridges and culverts shall be in accordance with the USDOT Federal Highway Administration publications HDS-5 and HEC-10 entitled "Hydraulic Design of Highway Culverts" and "Capacity Charts for the Hydraulic Design of Highway Culverts," respectively. Structures so designed shall be checked against a storm of 100-year frequency to protect against serious harm and/or significant damage. 
d.  Runoff estimate shall be based on the upstream basin being fully developed in accordance with the latest approved and applicable comprehensive development plan. 
e.  In addition to the general criteria stated above, the following specific criteria shall also be applied: 
1.  Detailed engineering calculations in accordance with above manuals must be submitted with design report. 
2.  Bridges: One foot of clearance between the lowest point of the underside of the superstructure and the 50-year design storm level shall be provided. 
3.  General: Any bridge or culvert involved with a state highway must meet the criteria of the DelDOT. 
4.  All watercourses crossed by streets or alleys shall be provided with permanent culverts of adequate length and size. A suitable apron shall be provided at the discharge end of the culverts as per the most current Delaware Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, and an approved method of protection against erosion shall be provided at the intake where necessary. 
f.  A report showing hydrologic, hydraulic, and design computations shall be prepared for each bridge or major culvert and may be made available to the city department of public works. Each report shall contain the following minimum data: 
1.  Location map (U.S.C. and G.S. or aerial photos) showing the location of the structure and the limits of the drainage area. 
2.  Vicinity map showing specific details near the structure including contours, existing details, and the location and details of the proposed improvement. In some cases, stream cross sections may be acceptable in lieu of a topographical map, subject to the approval of the director of public works. 
3.  Information on structures and channels upstream and downstream from the proposed improvement. This should include type and size of the structure, channel cross sections, high and low water marks, and any other pertinent data obtained in the field investigation. Analysis of the adjacent channels and structures shall be made to determine the effects, if any, on the proposed improvements. 
4.  Hydrologic analysis. 
5.  Hydraulic analysis of the proposed improvement showing the estimated velocities, storm level elevations, and backwater curves where necessary. 
6.  Federal and state agency permits as required or letters, in lieu thereof, from same stating permits are not required. 
(c)  Surface water collection and disposition. 
(1)  Each person, corporation, or other entity which makes any surface changes shall be required to: 
a.  Collect on-site runoff and dispose of it to the point of discharge into the common natural watercourse of the drainage area, or to such other point approved by the director of public works. 
b.  Handle existing off-site runoff through his development but size any pipes he installs and size any easements and make any on-site improvements for a fully developed area upstream. 
c.  Pay the proportionate share of the total cost of off-site improvements to the common natural watercourse based on a fully developed drainage area. 
d.  Provide onsite stormwater controls as approved by the director of public works when downstream improvements are physically or economically impractical. 
(2)  City of Newark shall be required to: 
a.  Assess and collect the cost of off-site improvements to the common natural watercourses from the developer and/or property owner. Assessments shall be on the undeveloped land of the drainage area only and the proportionate share for the existing developed land may be provided by the city. Collection may be delayed until the assessed land is approved for development. 
b.  Acquire easements for such common natural watercourse improvements. 
c.  Supervise such improvements to completion. 
(3)  DelDOT shall be required to make improvements to any existing state maintained or owned street or road crossing of the common natural watercourse as needed for upstream development and as state funds are made available. 
(d)  Stabilization. Where changes in the surface are made that increase water runoff into a watercourse or where a change is made to a natural watercourse, either of which will result in erosion, that watercourse shall be stabilized. Where the flow/soil conditions exceed the stabilizing ability of vegetation, then as a second option a combination vegetative/mechanical means of stabilization (biotechnical methods of stream bank stabilization) will be explored, and as a third and least desirable option, a straight mechanical method will be explored. 
(e)  Storms exceeding criteria. There will always be storms or local flooding conditions that exceed the capacity of the drainage system. Therefore, open systems should be designed with free board, and closed systems should be designed for overland flow or other provisions should be made to prevent damage when the capacity of the system is exceeded. 
(f)  Watercourse improvements by the City of Newark. 
(1)  Qualification criteria. 
a.  Improvements to public and communal watercourses and drainage systems by the city shall only be made to city owned property: 
1.  To protect persons and property from serious harm and significant damage from flooding caused by storms of up to 100-year intensity; 
2.  To reduce cost of city maintenance of such watercourses and systems, providing the annual average maintenance divided by the annual amortization cost of the improvement over a ten year payoff equals at least 110%; 
3.  To protect dwelling unit(s) or attachment structure(s) from structural damage because of the action of flowing water; 
4.  To eliminate a public health hazard certified as such by the state health officer, providing other methods are not available or practical to eliminate said health hazard. 
(2)  Approval procedure. See Article XXVI, Special Provisions for Floodplains, in City Zoning Code. 
(3)  Design considerations. 
a.  Improvements to streams and watercourses shall be engineered and constructed to preserve and enhance the natural environment wherever practical. 
(g)  Inundation of yards or periodic basement flooding or loss of nonstructural property due to stream bank erosion or flooding is not considered significant damage. Ponding or failure of a lot to drain is not the responsibility of the city to correct; however, the city should seek developer or builder correction where the plan of drainage or lines and grades was not followed. Change of grade by an upstream neighbor to the detriment of the downstream neighbor is not the responsibility of the city to correct. Similarly, change of grade by a downstream neighbor to the detriment of an upstream neighbor is not the responsibility of the city to correct. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 2, 5-23-05) 
Section V. - Groundwater. 
(a)  Wet areas. 
(1)  Certain areas have poor drainage characteristics which result in seasonally high water tables near or at the surface of the ground. Structures built in these areas shall be protected by an approved method which will lower the water table below the structure basement or lowest floor, or the structure shall be protected by such other means, as approved by the building department. 
(2)  "Wet areas" are those areas having seasonally high water tables from approximately 36 inches below the surface of the ground. These areas are all lands so designated on sheets 1 through 58 inclusive of the soil survey of New Castle County, Delaware (U.S.D.A. SCS Series) as listed in Exhibit 2, Table A. 
(3)  Waiver from the requirements of this section may be granted where evidence is submitted to indicate that the land is not of the type shown on the soil survey sheets. Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) personnel may be consulted in such case. Structures built in wet areas with basements or habitable spaces below grade shall be provided with foundation drains, and foundation walls shall be water-proofed. 
(4)  Foundation or footing drains shall be provided around foundations enclosing basements or habitable spaces below grade. Drains shall be installed at or below the area to be protected and shall discharge by gravity or by mechanical means to a positive outfall such as a drainage ditch or swale, or into a sump pit from which it shall be pumped to discharge into the storm drainage system. Such discharges, however, shall be designed and installed so as not to cause icing conditions on sidewalks, driveways, curbs, or streets, or continuous saturated conditions along common swales. Under no conditions shall the drain discharge into the sanitary sewer. 
a.  Foundation and footing drains shall be installed per the most current building code or as approved by the building department. 
(5)  Exterior walls enclosing basements or habitable spaces below grade in wet areas shall be water-proofed in an approved manner as required by the building department per the most current building code. 
(6)  Wherever springs or wet areas are encountered in the excavation for a structure, the method of draining must be approved by the departments of public works and building. 
(7)  Alternate methods of protecting the structure requiring foundation drains and/or foundation wall water-proofing may be approved if they are deemed adequate by the Directors of public works and building. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 2, 5-23-05) 
Section VI. - Grading for drainage. 
(a)  Yards and other surfaces. 
(1)  The yards of every structure shall be graded to carry water away from that structure and dispose of it without ponding or excessive erosion, and all land within a development shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface water without ponding or excessive erosion except where approved by the departments of public works and building. For the purposes of this subsection, ponding shall mean a visual accumulation of water above the surface of the ground remaining 48 hours after the end of rainfall. Areas susceptible to erosion shall be sodded or stabilized by other means as stipulated by the public works director. 
(2)  The directors of public works and building will review the plan submission required by the city regulations to determine its feasibility for recordation purposes. 
(3)  An overall lines and grades approval shall be required before construction begins. The first phase of this approval shall be a detailed drainage design with calculations showing that full development of the upstream basin has been considered in sizing all drainage structures associated with the development. Two copies of the drainage calculations and drainage plans are to be submitted to the department of public works for review. Calculations and sizing of structures are to be in accordance with the requirements of this appendix. At the option of the developer, a single plan satisfying drainage and lines and grades may be submitted. The second phase of this approval shall be the submission and approval by the department of public works of a detailed sediment and erosion control plan. No stripping of vegetation or earth moving shall be permitted on the site until the erosion and sediment control plan is approved. The lines and grades submission shall identify the name of the engineer or land surveyor duly registered in the State of Delaware responsible for preparation of the plan. Copies of the plan shall be signed and sealed by the engineer or land surveyor. The scale of the lines and grades plan shall be sufficient to provide the following in a clear and legible manner:

2.  Documentation of the seasonal high water table elevation with respect to the proposed channel depth shall be provided to evaluate the potential of the ditch intersecting the ground water table causing the channel to receive greater flows than design capacity and the possibility for continually wet surfaces within the channel. 
3.  Minimum bottom width shall be 3 feet where the depth exceeds 1 foot. 
4.  Minimum design velocity shall be 2 ft./sec. Where swales are designed specifically as a BMP, lesser velocities will be permitted. 
5.  The maximum design velocity in a grassed channel shall not exceed the permissible values stated in the Standards and Specifications for Vegetated Channels section of the Delaware Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Development, except as provided with structural measures as detailed therein. Also noted therein, sustained wet conditions in a channel are not amenable to the establishment of adequate vegetative cover; therefore, where conditions will exist which indicate a base flow in the channel; the channel shall be provided with a stone center according to the specifications noted above. 
6.  Maximum side slopes: 3 foot horizontal to 1 foot vertical for unpaved (vegetated side slopes). Steeper side slopes may be approved upon submittal and approval of sound engineering design.

3.  Center line gradients of the streets shall be suitable to provide adequate surface drainage and reasonable safety for traffic, and shall generally be no steeper than 10%. 
4.  Minimum gradient for streets shall be 1% unless analysis indicates that a flatter gradient cannot be avoided. 
5.  Driveway sloping toward building shall be graded in such a manner that the drainage will be intercepted prior to inundating the building. 
6.  Maximum gradient in parking areas to be 14%. Minimum gradient in parking areas to be 1%. 
(6)  The following are specific requirements for single-family dwellings: 
a.  Protective slopes around buildings:

When acceptable to the department of public works, lesser gradients than those required for pervious surfaces above may be accepted when the lesser grading is adequate to drain the lot without detrimental effect upon buildings or upon essential lot uses, including any individual sewage disposal system. Conditions which would result in prolonged standing of water (defined as 48 hours after a storm) at any season are not acceptable. 
Where surface water disposal is proposed by infiltration into the ground, technical exhibits such as soil gradient analysis and infiltration tests may be required. 
Wet areas as defined in Section V(2) may require underground drains to carry surface and ground water to point of discharge into storm system or stormwater management facility. 
2.  Maximum gradient: Other areas within the subdivision, 3 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical except that, if vertical height of slope does not exceed 30 inches, maximum gradient may be 2 feet horizontal to one foot vertical. 
If slope is held by satisfactory existing vegetation or rock outcropping and is not going to be disturbed, no limit when present and future stabilization is assured. 
Top and bottom of banks at swales, terraces, etc., shall be rounded for convenient maintenance. 
c.  Open channels (ditches/swales): See Section VI(a)(5)c. 
d.  Storm water disposal:

2.  Maximum gradient in residential driveways to be 14%. Minimum gradient in residential driveways to be 1%. 
(7)  Any or parts of a requirement can be waived by the director of public works for a particular submission if sound engineering practice and judgment warrant such a waiver, subject to all applicable requirements in the most current Delaware Sediment and Stormwater Regulations. 
(8)  All revisions to an approved plan must be approved by the director of public works. A new reproducible and copies shall be submitted which comply with the above requirements. 
(9)  All violations shall be considered a violation of the building permit. 
(10)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, construction and building on properties with slopes exceeding 25% shall not be permitted, except with the approval of the public works director upon consideration of the geological, hydrological, and soil conditions of the site. 
(b)  Overland flow. Concentration of diffused natural surface water flow shall only be permitted in swales or watercourses. 
(c)  Floor elevations. The lowest floor of every structure shall be elevated above the elevation of the 100-year flood, except as modified in Section III(c) above. 
(d)  Slopes. Slopes created by regrading shall be limited in degree of vertical incline and/or interrupted by terraces and/or equipped with foot and terrace drains as required, and/or stabilized by other structural techniques as required, at the discretion of the public works director, to prevent earth slippage. 
(e)  Specific stormwater system design requirements.

(2)  The total number of catch basins at any one location must be sufficient to carry runoff up to the 100-year storm event without water overflowing the curb unless an approved method for overland conveyance is provided. 
(3)  For storm sewer pipes, the maximum and minimum allowable velocities shall be ten feet per second and 21/2 feet per second, respectively. Normally, all storm sewer pipes should be placed with a cover of at least two feet. Variance(s) are subject to the approval of the public works director. 
(4)  In designing storm sewers, it is allowable to design the pipes to flow full as long as the hydraulic gradient is not located higher than one foot below the top of any catch basin or manhole. 
(5)  The outfall pipe to convey stormwater from catch basins to a drainage channel shall extend to a point at least 50 feet beyond the rear house line, unless it shall be a natural watercourse, in which case only a street culvert shall be required. 
(6)  Minimum pipe diameter shall be 15 inches. 
(7)  Storm manholes or junction boxes shall be used for changes in the direction of flow (the maximum deflection shall be 90 degrees).

e.  Description of the methods used to identify the wetlands delineated on the plan. 
f.  Copies of all applicable federal and/or state wetlands permits or a letter from the applicant specifying compliance with all applicable nationwide and/or state permits. 
(2)  Upon written request at the time of minor or major subdivision application, the public works department may waive the requirement for a wetlands report for all or a portion of the subdivision, based on one or more of the following conditions: 
a.  New or additional construction is not proposed. 
b.  New or additional construction is proposed for areas of the subdivision currently paved with impervious surfaces. 
c.  New or additional construction is proposed in developed areas where in the determination of the public works director, no wetlands impact will occur. 
(b)  Interpretation of wetlands boundaries. 
(1)  The wetlands boundary shall be determined by using the methodology in the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (1987), and as may be amended from time to time. 
(2)  When interpretation is needed as to the exact location of wetlands boundaries, the public works director shall make the necessary interpretation. 
(3)  Any applicant contesting a location of the wetlands boundary shall have the burden of establishing that such land does not lie within wetlands as defined in this appendix. 
(c)  Standards for wetlands design. Because the preservation of Newark's wetlands in an undisturbed natural condition constitutes important physical, aesthetic, recreational, water quality, health, and economic assets for our community, subdivision plans with delineated wetlands shall be subject to the following site design and construction requirements and review criteria: 
Site design and construction requirements: 
(1)  There shall be minimal feasible alteration or impairment to the wetlands' characteristics and its existing contours, and to its vegetation and hydrologic condition; any such alteration shall not cause significant degradation of ground and surface water quality and quantity. 
(2)  For undeveloped lands, a 50-foot wide buffer area surrounding the wetlands measured from the edge of the wetlands jurisdictional line shall be required. This buffer area shall consist of natural and minimally disturbed vegetation, with any such disturbance subject to the standards in subsection (1) above. A five-foot wide pathway mowed to a minimum height of four inches through the buffer for pedestrian access to the wetland(s) may be permitted. For wetlands located on previously developed parcels, the buffer area shall consist of the area, no wider than 50 feet, between the site's impervious surface and the wetlands jurisdictional line. 
(3)  Stormwater management facilities are permitted, as per DNREC's Delaware Sediment and Stormwater Regulations, if wetlands are maintained or enhanced, and if the disturbance for stormwater management is the only feasible alternative, subject to all state and federal permits and wetlands mitigation requirements. 
Review criteria: 
(1)  Whether reasonable design alternatives exist to minimize the disturbance of wetlands on the site, including site design to incorporate wetlands within proposed public or private open space. 
(2)  Whether wetlands disturbance depicted on the subdivision plan accurately reflects those activities necessary to develop the site as proposed. 
(3)  The quality of the wetlands that may be impacted and the amount of wetlands to be disturbed. 
(4)  Whether the subdivision plan complies with all other applicable floodplain, water resource protection area, wet areas, and related requirements of this Code. 
(d)  Design alternatives. Notwithstanding the site design and constructions requirements set forth in the preceding subsection (c), the public works and water resources director may approve modifications to the subdivision plan site design that serve to preserve or enhance wetland areas or minimize the disturbance of wetlands. As specified in the Delaware Sediment and Stormwater Regulations, wetland disturbance for stormwater management shall be limited to the construction of pond embankments, provided that the intended or functional aspects of the stormwater facility and wetlands are maintained or enhanced and the construction in the wetlands for this purpose is the only reasonable alternative. All necessary state and federal permits must be obtained and mitigation measures satisfied.

APPENDIX IV. - SEDIMENT AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Section I. - Stormwater Management and Drainage Conveyance. 
(a)  Stormwater management design basis: Both water quantity and quality are an integral component of overall stormwater management. 
(1)  Stormwater quantity management. Control of peak discharge will, to some extent, prevent increases in flooding. 
a.  The post-development peak discharge rates for the 2, 10, and 100-year frequency storm events shall not exceed the pre-development peak discharge rates for the 2, 10, and 100-year frequency storm events. 
b.  Waivers or variances from the stormwater quantity design criteria may be granted on a case-by-case basis. 
(2)  Stormwater quality management. Control of runoff from small, frequent rainfall events on-site will mitigate further degradation of water quality and habitat. 
a.  In general, the preferred option for water quality protection shall be those practices collectively referred to as "green Technology BMP's." Other practices shall be considered only after preferred practices have been eliminated for engineering or hardship reasons as approved by the appropriate plan approval agency. 
b.  Water quality control practices shall be designed to manage the rate and volume of runoff of flow from the 2.0" NRCS Type II rainfall event, or the rainfall event that produces up to a maximum of 1.0" of runoff. 
c.  Alternative stormwater quality practices may be acceptable if the removal efficiency for suspended solids meets or exceeds 80% as approved by DNREC or as demonstrated by scientifically independent evaluation and monitoring performance data. 
d.  Other acceptable stormwater quality practices may be acceptable if the removal efficiency for suspended solids meets or exceeds 80 percent as approved by DNREC or as demonstrated by scientifically independent evaluation and monitoring performance data. 
e.  Waivers or variances from the stormwater quality design criteria may be granted on a case-by-case basis. 
(b)  Projects requiring storm water management approval shall include: 
(1)  Pre- and post-development velocities, peak rates of discharge, and inflow and outflow hydrographs of stormwater runoff at all existing and proposed points of discharge from the site. 
(2)  All stormwater management designs shall use the NRCS Technical Release # 55 or # 20, the Delaware Urban Runoff Management Model (DURMM) or any other methodologies as approved by DNREC's Division of Soil and Water Conservation. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 3, 5-23-05) 
Section II. - Erosion and Sediment Control. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  Erosion is the process by which the land's surface is worn away by the action of wind, water, ice and gravity. Water generated erosion is the most severe type of erosion, and can be broken down into the following types: Raindrop, Sheet, Rill, Gully, and Channel erosion. 
(2)  Any land development activity that disturbs 5,000 square feet or more shall have an approved sediment and stormwater plan in accordance with the most recent version of the Delaware Erosion and Sediment Control (E&SC) Handbook, and Title 7 of the Delaware Code, Chapter 40. 
(3)  E&SC Practices shall be installed prior to any on-site grading or soil disturbance. 
(4)  Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping vegetation, regrading, or other development, it shall be the responsibility of the person, corporation, or other entity causing such sedimentation to remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems, and watercourses, and to repair any damage at his expense and within the time prescribed by the director of public works. 
(5)  The E&SC plan shall be reviewed by the public works director or designee and approved when in conformance with the most current version of the Delaware Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook and Title 7 of the Delaware Code, Chapter 40. 
(6)  Starting construction without the approved E&SC plan and/or stormwater plan is a violation of state law and regulations and could result in a stop work order, as well as possible enforcement action. Approved plans must be kept on site at all times. 
(b)  Erosion and sediment control (E&SC) plan. The E&SC plan shall contain the following components: 
(1)  An overall E&SC schematic plan showing a map of the basic site features, legend, standard symbols and data for all E&SC practices; 
(2)  A detailed E&SC plan(s) showing disturbed areas, limits of disturbance, areas of preservation, land grading techniques, pre-and post-development grading and contours, and all E&SC practices, temporary and permanent stabilization areas, general topography and soil characteristics, legend, details and specifications; 
(3)  Written information such as approvals, owner/developer certifications, location and vicinity map, general/special notes, construction instructions, vegetative notes and the sequence of construction, pollution prevention measures. 
(4)  Provisions for the maintenance of E&SC measures. The cost of installing and maintaining all erosion and sediment controls and practices shall be borne by the developer and/or owner. These measures shall be adequately maintained until it has been determined by the public works director that the site has been permanently stabilized. 
Developer and/or owner proposed modifications to the originally approved E&SC plan shall be processed and approved or disapproved by the public works director, and must be submitted in writing before changes are implemented. 
The public works director reserves the right to require additional E&SC measures as deemed necessary. 
(c)  Erosion and sediment (E&S) control design. The E&S control design may include, but is not limited to, the following components: 
(1)  Sediment trapping practices such as straw bale barriers, silt fencing, sediment traps, temporary sediment basins, storm drain inlet and culvert inlet protection. 
(2)  Dewatering practices such as pumping pits, portable dewatering practices, and dewatering basins and devices. 
(3)  Soil stabilization practices such as top soiling, slope treatment, vegetative stabilization, stream bank stabilization, mulching, stabilization matting, stabilized construction entrances, and dust control. 
(4)  Water control practices such as swales, berms, vegetative channels, lined channels, diversions, check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drain chutes, rip rap outlet protection, and rip rap stilling basins. 
(5)  Pollution prevention practices which are designed to prevent generation of non-point source pollution from construction sites due to improper handling and usage of nutrients and toxic substances, and to prevent the movement of toxic substances from the construction site. 
(6)  Miscellaneous practices which address minor development and tree protection. Practices shall be designed and implemented in order to prevent soil from moving off site. These practices shall be designed in accordance with the most recent version of the Delaware Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, and Title 7 of the Delaware Code, Chapter 40. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 3, 5-23-05) 
Section III. - Post-Construction. 
(a)  As-built plans. All construction applicants are required to submit actual "as-built" plans for any stormwater management practices after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer or professional land surveyor. A final inspection by the City of Newark is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. 
(b)  Maintenance. All stormwater management facilities must undergo, at a minimum, an annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this ordinance, the city's designation as a delegated agency by DNREC, and our NPDES stormwater permit. 
    The owner or person responsible shall perform or cause to perform preventative maintenance of all completed stormwater management practices to ensure proper functioning. 
    The maintenance of stormwater management facilities shall be in accordance with public works department inspection findings and recommendations. All maintenance work shall be approved and inspected by the public works department. 
    Maintenance may be subject to additional permit requirements to be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
(c)  Right of entry. The public works director or his designee, bearing proper credentials and identification, may enter and inspect all properties for regular periodic inspections, investigations, monitoring, observation, measurement, enforcement, sampling and testing, to effectuate the provisions of this Appendix and/or the NPDES storm water permit. The inspections shall be conducted at reasonable times. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 3, 5-23-05) 
Section IV. - Illicit Discharges. 
(a)  Discharge prohibitions. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
Unless identified as a significant source of pollutants to waters of the state, the following non-stormwater discharges need not be prohibited from entering the municipal separate storm sewer system provided such sources are identified and appropriate control measures to minimize the impacts of such sources, are developed under the stormwater management plan. 
  Water line flushing 
  Landscape irrigation 
  Diverted stream flows 
  Rising ground waters 
  Uncontaminated groundwater infiltration to separate storm sewers 
  Uncontaminated pumped groundwater

  Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands 
  De-chlorinated swimming pool discharges 
  Street wash waters 
  Discharges or flows from emergency fire fighting activities 
Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires verbal and/or written notification to the City of Newark prior to the time of testing. 
(b)  Illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm sewer system is prohibited. 
    This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
    Any owner or person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, shall be required to implement, at the owner's or person's expense, the BMP's necessary to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. 
    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any owner or person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting in, or may result in, illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm sewer system, the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. Discharge notification shall be made in accordance with Title 7, Chapter 60, subchapter II, § 6028 of the Delaware Code. 
    Commercial, industrial and residential facilities shall employ good housekeeping practices to prevent debris such as cigarette butts, paper, bottles, cans, plastic, grass, etc. from entering the municipal storm sewer system from areas such as parking lots, loading zones, sidewalks, trash cans and dumpster sites. It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge chemicals, waste products or any pollutant to the parking lot or grounds of a commercial area, industrial facility, or residence, which allows such pollutants to enter the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 3, 5-23-05) 
Section V. - Enforcement and penalties. 
(a)  Administrative enforcement remedies. The following enforcement remedies may be utilized to enforce this appendix. 
(1)  Notification of violation. A certified letter explaining the code violation, with a timeframe set forth to cease the violating action, correct a deficiency found, or to cleanup the result of the violating action. 
(2)  Reimbursement of costs. When the city has paid for the cleanup and/or work performed as a result of no action taken, it will recover the actual cost of the cleanup and/or work performed, plus 50% in city overhead, plus accrued interest at the Delaware legal rate of interest per annum from the date of completion of the work. These charges shall be billed to the owner or responsible person in charge of the property. 
If the full amount due the city is not paid by the owner or responsible party, or his or her agent, within the time required, the city shall cause to be recorded in the municipal lien docket a statement showing the cost and expense incurred for the work, the date and the place or property on which said work was done. The recordation of said statement shall constitute a lien on the property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal and interest until final payment has been made. 
(3)  Penalties. The following penalties shall be applicable to violations of this appendix: Failure to correct any action, which is prohibited by this appendix, shall constitute a violation. Every day in which a violation exists shall constitute a separate violation and a separate offense. Any person violating any of the provisions of this appendix shall be subject to a fine of not less than $100.00, nor more than $1,000.00, for each offense. 
(4)  Referral to DNREC enforcement. If no action is taken to remedy a violating action, then referral to a DNREC environmental protection officer will be made, and the legal fine limits double. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, Amend. No. 3, 5-23-05)

APPENDIX V. - DESIGN STANDARDS FOR SANITARY SEWERS [] 

Footnotes: 
--- () --- 
Charter reference- Sewers, Ch. 25. 

Section I. - Design standards for sanitary sewers. 
(a)  Type of sewers. In general, and except for special reasons, the water and waste water department will approve plans for new systems, extensions, or replacement sewers only when designed upon the separate plan, in which rain water from roofs, streets, and other areas, and ground water from foundation drains are excluded. 
    Overflows from intercepting sewers should not be permitted at points where they will adversely affect the watercourse or the use of water therefrom. Otherwise, provision shall be made for treating the overflow. 
(b)  Design period. In general, sewer systems should be designed for the estimated ultimate tributary population, except in considering parts of the system that can be readily increased in capacity. Similarly, consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parks, etc. 
(c)  Design factors. In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered: 
(1)  Maximum hourly sewerage flow. 
(2)  Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants. 
(3)  Groundwater infiltration. 
(4)  Topography of area. 
(5)  Location of waste treatment plant. 
(6)  Depth of excavation. 
(7)  Pumping requirements. 
(d)  Design basis. 
(1)  Per capita flow. New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily per capita flow of sewage of not less than 100 gallons per day. This figure is assumed to cover normal infiltration, but an additional allowance should be made where conditions are unfavorable. Generally, the sewers should be designed to carry, when running full, not less than the following daily per capita contributions of sewage, exclusive of sewage or other waste flow from industrial plants: 
a.  Laterals and submain sewers: 400 gallons. 
b.  Main, trunk, and outfall sewers: 250 gallons. 
c.  Interceptors: Normally no interceptor shall be designed for less than 350% of the gauged or estimated average dry weather flow. 
(2)  Alternate method. When deviations from the foregoing per capita rates are demonstrated, a description of the procedure used for sewer design shall be included. 
(e)  Details of design and construction. 
(1)  Minimum size. No sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter. 
(2)  Depth. In general, sewers shall be sufficiently deep so as to receive sewage from basements and to prevent freezing. 
(3)  Slope. All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second, based on Kutter's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. Use of other practical "n" values may be permitted by the city if deemed justifiable on the basis of research or field data presented. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable: 
Sewer size Minimum slope in feet
(per 100 feet)  8-inch 0.40 10-inch 0.28 12-inch 0.22 14-inch 0.17 15-inch 0.15 16-inch 0.14 18-inch 0.12 21-inch 0.10 24-inch 0.08 27-inch 0.067  30-inch 0.058  36-inch 0.046   
    Under special conditions, if detailed justifiable reasons are given, slopes slightly less than those required for the two feet per second velocity when flowing full may be permitted. Such decreased slopes will only be considered where the depth of flow will be 0.3 of the diameter or greater for design average flow. Whenever such decreased slopes are selected, the applicant must furnish with his report his computations of the depths of flow in such pipes at minimum, average, and daily or hourly rates of flow. It must be recognized that decreased slopes may cause additional sewer maintenance expense. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 20% slope or greater shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors or approved equal, spaced as follows: 
a.  Not over 36 feet center to center on grades 20% and up to 35%. 
b.  Not over 24 feet center to center on grades 35% and up to 50%. 
c.  Not over 16 feet center to center on grades 50% and over. 
(4)  Alignments. Sewers 24 inches or less shall be laid with straight alignment between manholes. 
(5)  Increasing size. When a smaller sewer joins a larger one, the invert of the larger sewer should be lowered sufficiently to maintain the same energy gradient. An approximate method for securing these results is to place the 0.8 depth point of both sewers at the same elevation. 
(6)  High velocity protection. Where velocities greater than 15 feet per second are attained, special provision shall be made to protect against displacement by erosion and shock. 
(7)  Materials. Any generally accepted material for sewers will be given consideration, but the material selected should be adapted to local conditions, such as character of industrial wastes, possibility of septicity, soil characteristics, exceptionally heavy external loadings, abrasion, and similar problems. 
    All sewers shall be designed to prevent damage from superimposed loads. Proper allowance for loads on the sewer shall be made because of the width and depth of trench. When standard strength sewer pipe is not sufficient, the additional strength needed may be obtained by using extra strength pipe or by special construction. 
(8)  Joints and infiltration. The method of making joints and the materials used should be included in the specifications. Sewer joints shall be designed to minimize infiltration and to prevent the entrance of roots. Leakage tests shall be specified. This may include appropriate water or low pressure air testing. The leakage outward or inward (exfiltration or infiltration) shall not exceed 500 gallons per inch of pipe diameter per mile per day for any section of the system. The use of television camera or other visual methods for inspection prior to placing the sewer in service is recommended. 
(9)  Calculations. Computation should be presented, in a tabular form, to indicate depths and velocities at minimum, average, and maximum daily waste flow for the different sewer sizes proposed. 
(10)  Lateral clean-outs. All laterals shall be designed with a clean-out installed on the property line. 
(f)  Manholes. 
(1)  Location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; at all changes in grade, size, or alignment; at all intersections; and at distances not greater than 400 feet for sewers 15 inches or less, and 500 feet for sewers 18 inches to 30 inches. Lampholes may be used only for special conditions and shall not be substituted for manholes nor installed at the end of laterals greater than 150 feet in length. 
(2)  Drop pipe. A drop pipe should be provided for a sewer entering a manhole at an elevation of 24 inches or more above the manhole invert. Where the difference in elevation between the incoming sewer and the manhole invert is less than 24 inches, the invert should be filleted to prevent solids deposition. 
(3)  Diameter. The minimum diameter of manholes shall be 48 inches. 
(4)  Flushing. Flap gates are desirable in manholes at the upstream end of laterals which are at minimum grades and which are not to be extended at an early date. 
(5)  Flow channel. The flow channel through manholes should be made to conform in shape and slope to that of the sewers. 
(6)  Watertightness. Watertight manhole covers are to be used wherever the manhole tops may be flooded by street runoff or high water. Manholes shall be constructed of reinforced precast concrete sections with watertight joints. 
(g)  Inverted siphons. Inverted siphons should have not less than two barrels, with a minimum pipe size of six inches, and shall be provided with necessary appurtenances for convenient flushing and maintenance; the manholes shall have adequate clearances for rodding; and in general, sufficient head shall be provided and pipe sizes selected to secure velocities of at least three feet per second for average flows. The inlet and outlet details shall be arranged so that the normal flow is diverted to one barrel, and so that either barrel may be cut out of service for cleaning. 
(h)  Sewer extensions. In general, sewer extensions shall be allowed only if: 
(1)  The receiving sewage treatment plant is capable of adequately processing the added hydraulic and organic load; or 
(2)  Provision of adequate treatment facilities on a time schedule acceptable to the approving agency is assured. 
(i)  Protection of water supplies. 
(1)  Water supply interconnections. There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sewer, or appurtenance thereto, which would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply. 
(2)  Relation to water works structures. While no general statement can be made to cover all conditions, it is generally recognized that sewers shall meet the requirements of the city with respect to minimum distances from public water supply wells or other water supply sources and structures. 
(3)  Relation to water mains. 
a.  Horizontal separation. Whenever possible, sewers should be laid at least ten feet, horizontally, from any existing or proposed water main. Should local conditions prevent a lateral separation of ten feet, a sewer may be laid closer than ten feet to a water main if: 
1.  It is laid in a separate trench. 
2.  It is laid in the same trench with the water mains located at one side on a bench of undisturbed earth. 
3.  In either case, the elevation of the crown of the sewer is at least 18 inches below the invert of the water main. 
b.  Vertical separation. Whenever sewers must cross under water mains, the sewer shall be laid at such an elevation that the top of the sewer is at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main. When the elevation of the sewer cannot be buried to meet the above requirement, the water main shall be relocated to provide this separation or reconstructed with slip on or mechanical joint cast-iron pipe for a distance of ten feet on each side of the sewer. One full length of water main should be centered over the sewer so that both joints will be as far from the sewer as possible. 
c.  Special conditions. When it is impossible to obtain proper horizontal and vertical separation as stipulated above, the water main should be constructed of slip on or mechanical joint cast-iron pipe and the sewer constructed of mechanical joint cast-iron pipe, and both services should be pressure tested to assure watertightness. 
(Ord. No. 78-32, 9-11-78) 
APPENDIX VI. - PARKS, PLAYGROUNDS, RECREATION AREA REQUIREMENTS 
(a)  Recreation standards. 
(1)  The Newark City Council shall require that land be dedicated for parks and playgrounds, recreational areas, or open space locations where such would be appropriate. The parks and recreation department shall determine the number of acres to be reserved based upon the following calculations. These requirements are only applicable to single-family residential subdivisions of more than ten units or multifamily single lot subdivisions. 
(2)  Parkland required in residential subdivisions. 
Dwelling units 
per gross acre Percent acreage for 
parkland/open space 1-7  7% 8-14 12% 15 and up 17%  
(b)  Condition of land to be dedicated. Land for recreation or open space purposes shall be of a character and location suitable for use as a playground, playfield, or for other active or passive recreation purposes, and shall be level and dry; and shall be improved by the developer to the standards required by the director of the department of parks and recreation, which improvements shall be included in the performance bond. An active recreation site shall be accessible from at least one street. 50% of the land to be dedicated shall not exceed a minimum grade of 3%. The remainder of the land proposed for dedication shall not exceed 5%. Land to be dedicated shall be adequately drained. Subsurface investigation may be required by the public works director to determine whether or not the drainage capability of the soil is adequate. The public works director and the director of parks and recreation may recommend to city council that the subdivision/developer submit a cash payment in lieu of dedication where it is deemed that the drainage capability or other conditions at a site are not adequate for recreation purposes. All land to be reserved for dedication to the city for park purposes shall have prior approval of the city and shall be shown marked on the approved subdivision plan as lands "to be dedicated for park, recreation or open space purposes." 
(c)  Active recreation facility plan. The department of parks and recreation shall submit a plan as part of the subdivision advisory committee report detailing recommendations as to active recreation facilities to be required, related parking areas, and proposed landscaping. A report shall accompany this active recreation facilities plan outlining the proper procedure to be followed in bearing debris and waste, parking construction vehicles, and otherwise maintaining the condition of the site before dedication to the city. 
(d)  Timing of dedication. The city manager shall be empowered to require the land reserved for dedication to be deeded to the City of Newark under the terms of an approved subdivision plan, based upon the recommendation of the director of parks and recreation as to when sufficient recreation needs exist in the subdivision. The city manager must notify the subdivision/developer in writing that a transfer of land is requested at least 90 days prior to the desired date of transfer. Land reserved for dedication can only be transferred between March fifteenth and September fifteenth. At the time of transfer, the land must be adequately drained, graded, and sown in accordance with applicable city standards and specifications. 
(e)  Alternative procedure; money in lieu of land. Where, with respect to a particular subdivision, the reservation of land required pursuant to this section does not equal the percentage of total land required to be reserved in accordance with this appendix or the land is determined to be not suitable for dedication by the public works director and the director of the department of parks and recreation, the city council may require, prior to final approval of the construction improvements plan of the subdivision, that the applicant deposit with the city a cash payment in lieu of land dedication. Such deposit shall be used by the city for improvement of a neighborhood park, playground, or recreation area, including the acquisition of property. Such deposit must be used for facilities that will be actually available to and benefit the persons in said subdivision and be located in the general neighborhood of the subdivision. The city council shall determine the amount to be deposited, based upon the recommendation of the parks and recreation department. 
(f)  Other recreation dedications. The provisions of this section are minimum standards. None of the paragraphs above shall be construed to prohibit a developer from dedicating other lands for recreation or open space purposes in addition to the requirements of this appendix. 
(g)  Ownership of open space (alternate methods). With the approval of city council, parks, recreation facilities, or open space may be owned in common by the residents of an approved subdivision through condominium agreements, homeowner's associations, or related forms of joint ownership. Such facilities or open space must be preserved and maintained to the standards and requirements of the city. Common ownership agreements shall conform to all applicable laws of the State of Delaware and the City of Newark.

(a)  General regulations. No subdivision will be approved by the water and waste water department unless connection with a public water main is assured for each lot. The installation of water mains shall be governed by the following regulations. 
(b)  Cost of installation. 
(1)  The cost of installing all water mains and appurtenances such as valves, service lines, etc., within the subdivision shall be borne by the developer. 
(2)  If the subdivision is a considerable distance from the nearest city water main, the developer may be required to pay for all or a portion of the cost of extending the main to the subdivision. If the developer is required to pay for all or a part of the off-site extensions, the city shall provide a repayment plan based on the use of the facilities between existing lines and the edge of the subdivision. 
(c)  Plans. The developer shall prepare detailed plans for the water system in strict accordance with provisions of these subdivision regulations, and in accordance with all other related city specifications. The construction improvements plan must be approved by the director of water and waste water before any work shall be started. 
(d)  Installation procedure. The developer has the choice of two methods of constructing lines: 
(1)  Developer performs work under contract or by his own work crew. This work must be done under city specifications and under city supervision. All lines must be pressure tested before any taps are made. 
(2)  Developer may request city to construct lines: 
a.  City will put work out on contract and developer will pay for installation costs plus engineering services. 
b.  Work is performed by city crews on force account basis. Developer will pay for cost of materials, labor, and engineering services. 
c.  In either event, before any work is started or contract awarded, the developer must put in escrow sufficient funds to cover cost of work performed. 
(3)  All water mains and laterals must be installed according to city specifications. Water mains must be pressure tested according to city specifications, standards, and regulations before any lateral connections can be made. 
(e)  Maintenance. The developer will be responsible for water mains and laterals until final acceptance and official release of bonds, including repairs, if necessary, and other reasonable provisions for the convenience and safety of traffic. 
(f)  Location. Water distribution mains will be placed within public rights-of-way or easements with three and one-half feet of cover and spaced at least ten feet horizontally from parallel sanitary sewer mains. Copper water house services will also have three and one-half feet of cover. 
(g)  Water main sizes. 
(1)  The required size of the water main will vary with the character and size of the development. The minimum diameter for water main is eight inches. 
(2)  If any of the water mains in any subdivision become a portion of the primary distribution system, the water and waste water director may specify that a larger main be installed than is required for the particular subdivision. In such case, the additional expense incurred by increasing the size of the main may be assumed by the city. 
(3)  In dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs where water mains cannot be looped, the minimum water main size will be six inches with provisions for a fire hydrant on the end of the main. 
(h)  Lateral connection sizes. The minimum diameter of house connections is three-fourths inch. The diameter of lateral connections to apartment, commercial, or industrial buildings shall be designated by or approved by the water and waste water director. Each individual dwelling unit, with exception of apartment houses and multiple dwellings, shall have an individual lateral installed to the house. 
(i)  Materials. 
(1)  All materials used for water mains, laterals, and appurtenances must be equal to or better than the minimum standards and specifications established by the city for water lines. 
(2)  In general, all water distribution mains will be constructed using ductile iron cement-lined, tar-coated pipe. Pipe fittings will be gray cast-iron cement-lined, tar-coated. 
(3)  Water house services will be installed using type "K" copper. 
(j)  Valves. Sectionalizing valves shall be installed at all main branch connections, and at points designated by the water and wastewater director to sectionalize long continuous runs. Valves shall be placed in front of all fire hydrants. 
(k)  Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be installed at points designated by the water and wastewater director. The maximum spacing of fire hydrants shall be such that no portion of any lot is more than 500 feet from a hydrant. The water and wastewater director may designate additional hydrants be installed if need for additional protection is apparent. Specifications shall be obtained from the director before placing orders for fire hydrants. 
(l)  Water meters. 
(1)  Houses. The city will install a water meter in every house. The developer or builder shall install a meter yoke, which shall be purchased from the city, in each house at a location approved by the water and wastewater director or building inspector. 
(2)  Apartment houses. One meter installation may be used for apartment houses. City will furnish one meter for each individual connection to water main. If additional meters are required, developer or builder will pay for meter, yoke, and installation. All meter installations must be approved by the water and wastewater director or building inspector. 
(3)  Commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings. Water meter installations will be as designated by the water and wastewater director.

APPENDIX IX. - COMMUNITY ASSETS 

Section 1. - Community assets. 
(a)  Existing features on sites intended for development under these regulations, such as large trees, natural wooded groves, waterways, scenic locations, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable community assets, shall be preserved, insofar as possible giving consideration to economic feasibility, through the design of the subdivision; all major subdivision plans for the portions of the site to be developed shall include mapping of all trees of 24 inch DBH or greater (Diameter at Breast Height; that is, measured at 4.5 feet above the ground) and shall include the size of tree canopies and plans for the saving or removal of these trees. 
(b)  Major subdivision plans shall include as part of their environmental analysis (see Section 27-21(b), Major subdivision application) a detailed summary of the steps which will be taken by the applicant to preserve community assets as described above.

APPENDIX XI. - DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION AND/OR SOLAR ACCESS 

Section I. - Design standards for energy conservation and/or solar access. 
    Because all forms of extracted energy sources commonly in use are in short supply, and will apparently remain so for the near future, and have infinite limits of economic recovery and ultimate depletion, the City of Newark strongly encourages energy conservation and efficiency and the city supports land use and development which leaves as many options open as possible for the use of traditional and alternative sources of energy in the future. 
(a)  General design and construction principles. 
(1)  In general, to provide greater opportunity for southern orientation of windows, roofs, walls, and buildings, streets should run, insofar as possible, in an east-west direction, and lots, insofar as possible, should be sited on a north-south axis. 
(2)  In general, energy systems, including supply elements, furnaces, burners, tanks, boilers, distribution components, storage containers, heat exchangers, piping or other transfer mechanisms, controls, and related structural support for transportation and storing and collected energy, should include energy efficiency and conservation as a design and construction criterion. 
(3)  Natural features of the site, such as wooded areas and topography, should be incorporated into site and construction design with energy efficiency and conservation as a design criterion. 
(b)  Subdivision plan guidelines and requirements. 
(1)  All major and minor subdivision plans shall indicate "true," in addition to "magnetic" north. 
(2)  East-west orientation of the long axis of single-family detached dwellings and similar structures, varying 25° to the northwest and southwest, is encouraged. Note that a northwest variation can cause summer overheating if western windows are not shaded. 
(3)  North-south orientation of the long axis of townhouses, multifamily, and similar structures may be used to assure interior dwelling units of south-facing window solar access (see attached illustration). 
(4)  Side lot lines running north and south, modified accordingly as per building orientation in subsection (2) above, are encouraged. 
(5)  East-west street and roadway orientation is encouraged whenever feasible, considering topography, utility service, natural, and other site features. 
(6)  Developments should be designed so that a maximum number of buildings possible shall receive sufficient sunlight for using active solar energy systems for space, water, or industrial process heating or cooling, or passive solar systems for storing energy. Building and/or tree shadow plans shall be required for developments specifically incorporating solar energy systems into building construction.

APPENDIX XII. - CONDOMINIUM CONVERSIONS 

Section I. - Condominium conversions. 
(a)  Purpose and finding. The City of Newark, hereby finding that the conversion of existing multifamily and/or single-family row dwellings to condominium units have a substantial impact upon the city and its residents, and finding that unregulated conversion of multifamily and single-family row dwellings can decrease the availability of affordable rental housing for the elderly, and for low and moderate income families, and further finding that the conversion of multifamily and single-family row dwellings can have a negative impact on the health, safety, and general welfare of the people through sudden and traumatic dislocation of renters, especially for elderly and handicapped city residents, the City of Newark hereby declares that it is necessary to establish minimum regulations of conversion of condominiums within our community in order to best ensure the protection of the rights and obligations of the owners, developers, tenants, and other purchasers, as well as the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Newark. 
(b)  Scope. This appendix shall apply to all multifamily and single-family row dwellings as defined in Section 32-4(a)(40) and Section 32-4(a)(41) to be converted from rental dwelling units to condominium units as defined in the Unit Property Act, 25 Del. C., Chapter 22. No multifamily or single-family row dwelling unit shall be converted to condominiums except in strict accordance with all provisions of the subdivision and development regulations.

APPENDIX XIII. - DESIGN REVIEW FOR DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES 
(a)  Purpose. In conformity with the purposes of Section 2-89, General powers and duties of the Planning Commission, and Chapter 32, Zoning, of this Code, and the land development goals of the Comprehensive Development Plan II, the purpose of this appendix is to promote the most appropriate use of land, to encourage the beautification of buildings, to encourage high quality business growth, and to encourage and foster civic beauty, for commercial construction in downtown Newark. 
(b)  Applicability. This appendix is applicable to subdivision plans calling for construction of properties fronting on Main Street and located between Elkton Road/New London Road and Capitol Trail/Library Avenue. 
(c)  Submittal Requirements. Applicable subdivision plans shall include: 
(1)  Color scale elevations of all proposed buildings, showing the kind, color, and texture of materials to be used, for all sides of the building(s), visible from sidewalks and public areas, including parking lots; 
(2)  Color scale elevations showing all existing buildings, if applicable; 
(3)  Contextual color scale elevations showing front Main Street facades of all proposed buildings, the front Main Street facades of buildings immediately adjacent to the property; if applicable, the side or end facades of buildings on corner lots on Main Street and the front facades of buildings that do not front on Main Street adjacent to such corner properties, and, if applicable, the side or end facades of Main Street buildings visible from public ways with access to Main Street; 
(4)  All proposed signs, lighting, and related exterior features; and 
(5)  Other information may be required by the Planning Director to meet the purposes of this appendix. 
(d)  In reviewing these standards, the Planning Commission and Council shall encourage flexibility and creativity of design and shall recognize that these standards are intended to guide downtown development. That is, this review criteria is not intended to restrict imagination, innovation, or variety, but rather to assist in developing creative building designs that enhance the visual appearance of downtown Newark. The Planning Commission and Council shall consider the following: 
(1)  The appropriateness of the design elements of the building(s) in terms of the adjacent buildings and their relationship to each other. Appropriateness shall be considered in most cases to include evaluations of the following: 
a.  Height and bulk of buildings, that is, the scale and proportion of the building shall conform in general with adjacent buildings; facade modulation can help reduce the apparent bulk of a building. 
b.  Roof treatment of buildings; multifaceted roofs and awnings add visual interest. 
c.  Materials, colors, and texture of buildings. 
d.  Setback, in general, shall be consistent with that of adjacent buildings; parking in front of buildings is discouraged. 
(2)  The general architectural character, especially scale and stylistic features, including evaluations of the following:

e.  Screening from public view of mechanical equipment or utility hardware on roofs or grounds, with materials harmonious with the building; and 
f.  Screening from public view, refuse, waste removal areas, service yards, and related sites, using materials harmonious with the building. 
(3)  The Planning Commission and City Council may consider comments from the Design Committee of the Downtown Newark Partnership in reviewing downtown architectural plans and may also consult the Partnership's Design Guidelines for Main Street (1997). 
(Ord. No. 98-4, Amend. No. 3, 3-23-98; Ord. No. 00-18, Amend. No. 1, 6-26-00) 
APPENDIX XIV. - DESIGN REVIEW FOR MAJOR SUBDVISIONS NOT LOCATED DOWNTOWN 
(a)  Purpose. In conformity with the purposes of Section 2-89, General powers and duties of the planning commission, and Chapter 32, Zoning, of this code, and the land development goals of the Comprehensive Plan, the purpose of this appendix is to promote the most appropriate use of land, to encourage the beautification of buildings, to encourage high-quality growth, and to encourage and foster civic beauty for construction in Newark. 
(b)  Applicability. This appendix is applicable to major subdivision plans calling for construction of properties not covered by Appendix XIII; the review criteria in subsection (d) in this appendix also may be applicable to minor subdivision plans. If applicable, and as an alternative to the submittal and review requirements in this appendix, applicants may submit required building elevations and related information for city review through Chapter 7, Building, Section 7-16, Historic Buildings; or, Chapter 32, Zoning, Article XXVII, Site Plan Approval, of this code. 
(c)  Submittal requirements. Applicable major subdivision plans shall include: 
(1)  Color scale elevations of all proposed buildings, showing the kind, color, and texture of materials to be used for all sides of the building(s) visible from sidewalks and public areas, including parking lots; if several styles of buildings are proposed, typical examples of each type shall be provided. 
(2)  Color scale elevations showing all existing buildings on the site and existing public utilities visible from public ways, if applicable. 
(3)  Contextual color scale elevations showing front facades of all proposed buildings and the front facades of buildings immediately adjacent to the property. 
(4)  All proposed signs, lighting, and related exterior features. 
(5)  Visually prominent topographical features, including vistas, hilltops, ridges, stands of woodlands, and similar aspects of the natural landscape. An existing natural features plan or photographs showing such features may be required (see Appendix IX, Community Assets). 
(6)  Other information may be required by the planning director to meet the purposes of this appendix. 
(d)  In reviewing subdivisions under these standards the planning commission and council shall encourage flexibility and creativity of design and shall recognize that these standards are intended to guide development. That is, these review criteria are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation, or variety, but rather to assist in developing creative building designs that enhance the visual appearance of Newark. In addition, these standards are not listed in priority order; their relative importance should be weighed by the commission and council for each subdivision depending upon the subdivision's characteristics and the nature of the site. The planning commission and council shall consider the following: 
(1)  The appropriateness of the design elements of the building(s) in terms of the adjacent buildings and their relationship to each other. Appropriateness shall be considered in most cases to include evaluations of the following: 
a.  Height and bulk of buildings; that is, the scale and proportion of the building shall conform in general to adjacent buildings. In other words, the building's mass should respond or relate in some clear and obvious way to its immediate and distant neighbors. Facade modulation/articulation can help reduce the apparent bulk of a building. 
b.  Roof treatment of buildings; multifaceted roofs and awnings can add visual interest. 
c.  Materials, colors, and texture of buildings. 
d.  Setbacks, in general, shall be consistent with that of adjacent buildings; except for approved driveways, parking in front of buildings is discouraged. 
(2)  The general architectural character, especially scale and stylistic features, including evaluations of the following: 
a.  Use of natural materials, including stone, brick, and wood is encouraged; synthetic stucco, vinyl, and metal siding should be used less frequently. 
b.  Use of the same or similar building materials for all building walls, wholly or partially visible from street or public ways. 
c.  Signs, including identification signs of a prototype design and corporate logos, shall be designed as integral architectural elements of the building. 
d.  Exterior lighting, fixtures, standards, and all exposed accessories shall be designed as integral architectural elements of the building. 
e.  Screening from public view of mechanical equipment or utility hardware on roofs or grounds, with materials harmonious with the building. 
f.  Screening from public view of refuse, waste removal areas, service yards, including screening when stored of city required refuse containers, and related facilities and sites, using materials harmonious with the buildings. 
g.  For residences, garages shall not be the dominant element of the front building facade. 
h.  Screening of off-street parking and loading areas, utilizing the landscape requirements of Chapter 32, Zoning, of this code. 
i.  Screening from public view, including underground installation, insofar as possible and subject to the approval of the subdivision advisory committee, of public utilities and their related appurtenances, but not to include utility pad-mount transformers and above-ground pedestals. 
(3)  The preservation of natural light, natural resources, floodplains, woodlands, cultural features, and visually prominent topographical features. The features to remain shall be shown on the plan. 
(4)  The utilization of existing circulation patterns and the provision of bike and pedestrian ways. 
(5)  The planning commission and city council may consider comments from local and area architects and other design professionals requested to provide input as part of the design review process. 
(Ord. No. 06-26, Amend. No. 5, 9-25-06) 
APPENDIX XV. - TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS 
(a)  Purpose. In conformity with the purposes of Chapter 32, Zoning, of this code, Section 27-3, Policy, herein, and the land development goals of the Comprehensive Plan, the purpose of this appendix is to ensure, insofar as possible, that adequate traffic and transportation facilities are in place or will be available to meet the requirements of the proposed subdivision. 
(b)  Applicability. A traffic impact study (TIS) shall be submitted for all major subdivisions as required under the applicable Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) specifications and regulations for such studies and shall be subject to this appendix. Other major subdivisions may also require traffic impact analysis (TIS) or traffic impact commentary based on the recommendations of the planning department and/or subdivision advisory committee, in consultation with DelDOT. 
(c)  Traffic impact study requirements. A TIS shall be prepared under the guidance and direction of DelDOT and in conformance with all applicable DelDOT specifications and regulations. The planning department and subdivision advisory committee may make suggestions to DelDOT regarding the scope of the TIS; these suggestions may include requests for specific analysis of traffic issues directly related to the proposed development and its location. 
(d)  Methodology and guidelines for determining adequacy of transportation services. When reviewing DelDOT comments on required traffic impact studies, the planning commission and council shall consider the level of service (LOS) that will result from the subdivision with or without traffic and transportation mitigation measures. LOS typically is described as indicated below. These descriptions are for illustration purposes only to help the planning commission, council, and the community to understand, in a general sense, the traffic conditions typically associated with each level of service letter designation. LOS is, therefore, described as follows: 
    LOS is a traffic engineering scale that measures the amount of traffic that a roadway or intersection can accommodate, based on such factors as speed, travel time, traffic interruptions, maneuverability, comfort, and convenience. Level of service is in the form of letter designations as follows: 
(1)  Level of Service A indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on vehicle movement or speed. 
(2)  Level of Service B describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle movement and speed. All vehicle queues clear an intersection in a single signal cycle. 
(3)  Level of Service C describes a reasonably steady, high volume flow of traffic, with some limitations on movement and speed, and occasional backups at intersections. 
(4)  Level of Service D describes the level where traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections still function, but short vehicle queues develop, and vehicles may have to wait through one signal cycle during short traffic peaks. 
(5)  Level of Service E represents traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent (although momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe, but is not uncommon at peak traffic hours, with frequent stoppages, longstanding vehicle queues and blocked intersections. 
(6)  Level of Service F describes unsatisfactory stop and go traffic characterized by 'traffic jams' and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait through one or more signal changes, and nearby intersections may be blocked by the long vehicle queues. 
(e)  TIS review criteria. In reviewing traffic impact study comments from DelDOT, the planning commission and council shall consider the following: 
(1)  Subdivisions that result in a DelDOT indicated LOS of E or F, with traffic and transportation mitigation measures, do not meet the minimum acceptable standard. Subdivisions that result in a DelDOT indicated LOS of D may, depending upon the circumstances and location of the subdivision, require traffic and transportation mitigation measures. 
(2)  LOS D, E or F, however, may be considered acceptable in downtown Newark - the areas designated as 'Downtown Newark Development Districts' in the comprehensive plan, or at other locations, with the approval of council, based on special circumstances or conditions attributable to the site. 
(f)  Other transportation and transit facilities. If appropriate, subdivision plans may include transit facilities, including bus stops, bus 'pull-offs,' bus shelters, park-and-ride areas, and related facilities. Bikeways and related bike and pedestrian facilities shall also be required as appropriate.

a.  Timing of approval for applications. The city shall comply with all federal timing requirements for the consideration of applications for new towers, as well as collocated antennas that fall under the Spectrum Act and/or the October 2014 Report and Order promulgated by the FCC. Tower applications shall be accompanied by a professional engineer's report containing the following: 
1.  A technical evaluation of the utilization of existing towers for telecommunications or other equipment intended for the installation on the proposed tower, as well as a propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed tower or other communication facilities and equipment, a description of the type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/radio equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band) assigned to the applicant, the power in watts at which the applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests conducted by the applicant in determining the need for the proposed site and installation. 
2.  A technical evaluation of the feasibility of attaching the tower or antenna to an existing, or previously approved, structure or wireless support structure, or sited on land owned and maintained by the City of Newark. A list of approved, municipally-owned buildings and parcels appropriate for wireless facilities placement is kept on file at the city planning and development office. Council may deny an application to construct a new tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount an antenna on an existing structure. The applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers within a one-quarter of a mile radius of the site proposed for the tower, sought permission to install an antenna on those structures, buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the following reasons: 
i.  The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a reasonable cost. 
ii.  The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for that existing building, structure, or tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost. 
iii.  Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended function. 
iv.  A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with the owner of such building, structure, or tower. 
3.  Certification that the proposed tower will fill a significant gap in wireless coverage or capacity that exists in the applicable area and that the type of wireless facility being proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill that gap in wireless coverage. The existence or non-existence of a gap in wireless coverage shall be a factor in the city's decision on an application for approval of a telecommunications tower. 
4.  Written certification of compliance with Federal Communications Commission Safety Standards for exposure to nonionizing electromagnetic radiation. 
5.  Copies of all applicable state and federal permits. 
6.  An engineering analysis of the proposed tower, including a summary of the proposed tower's capacity to provide space for future co-location by others. 
b.  Any principal part of the tower, excluding guy cables, shall be set back from the nearest property line of a church, library, school, nursing home, hospital, or lot zoned residential (RH, RT, RS, RD, RM, RR, and AC) not less than three times the height of the tower or 350 feet, whichever is greater. The setback shall be measured from the nearest point of the base of the tower to the nearest point of the property line of the protected use. If the applicant uses self-collapsing technology in its tower design, the setback from the nearest property line shall be one and a half times the height of the tower or 150 feet, which is greater. 
c.  No artificial light shall be installed upon any such tower unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration. If such light is required, it shall be screened so as not to project its light below the horizontal plane in which it is located. 
d.  Towers shall not exceed 175 feet in height unless a variance is successfully obtained by the applicant. Towers over 200 feet in height shall be guyed and not self-supporting nor consisting of lattice type structures, unless the applicant demonstrates that a guyed tower shall have a greater negative visual impact than a self-supporting tower. 
e.  To the extent permitted by applicable federal law and FCC regulations, towers located on existing buildings or structures shall not extend beyond 22 feet above the highest point of the building or structure. Accessory buildings or facilities for towers located on existing buildings or structures shall be located either in or on top of such buildings or structures. 
f.  The applicant shall submit a soil report to the city complying with the standards of Appendix I: Geotechnical Investigations, ANSI/EIA-222, as amended, to document and verify the design specifications of the foundation of the tower, and anchors for guy wires, if used. 
Landscaping shall be provided around the base of the tower and adjacent to a required security fence that shall be at least ten feet high. The landscaping shall consist of a minimum 25-foot wide planting strip with ground cover and/or grass, including at least one row of six foot high evergreen trees providing a solid screen adjacent or proximate to the fence, and 15 foot high, two inch caliper deciduous trees, interspersed within the buffer area and no more than 20 feet apart. Applicants may substitute alternative landscape plans that meet the purposes of this subsection to limit the visual impact of the lower portion of the tower and adjoining accessory facilities. Camouflaged towers designed to look like trees may be exempt from this subsection, subject to council approval. Towers located on top of buildings three stories or more in height and telecommunication antennas located on existing buildings shall be exempt from this subsection, except that a six-foot high solid evergreen screen shall be required between any telecommunications antenna or tower accessory building and adjoining properties. A ten-foot high security fence and an adjoining six-foot high solid evergreen screen adjacent or proximate to the fence shall be provided around the anchoring facilities for guy wires for guyed towers. 
g.  No outdoor storage shall be permitted at the tower site. 
h.  Unless otherwise required by the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Aviation Administration, towers shall be light gray in color. Camouflaged towers designed to look like trees or employing other alternative methods of stealth technology may be exempt from this subsection, subject to council approval. Telecommunication antennas with colors designed to match buildings or structures to which they are attached shall be exempt from this subsection. Towers shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment and shall maximize the use of a like facade to blend with the existing surroundings and neighboring buildings to the greatest extent possible. 
Council shall consider whether its decision upon the subject application will promote the harmonious and orderly development of the zoning district involved; encourage compatibility with the character and type of development existing in the area; benefit neighboring properties by preventing a negative impact on the aesthetic character of the community; preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site to the greatest possible extent; and encourage sound engineering design and construction principles, practices and techniques. 
i.  A tower shall be located so as not to encroach into any established public or private airport approach as established by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
j.  Towers higher than 100 feet must be a minimum of 2,000 feet from the nearest similar tower, measured from the base of the towers. 
k.  New telecommunications facilities may be attached to an approved tower without applying for an additional special use permit so long as the new facility does not substantially change the dimensions of the wireless support structure, or trigger any other exemption outlined by federal or state regulation. Antennas being sited on structures that do not already act as wireless support structures may be approved administratively, so long as they do not exceed ten feet in height and are constructed with a stealth design approved by council. To the extent permitted by state and federal law, as built drawings must be submitted to staff in advance of receiving such administrative approval, in order to determine whether the applicants proposed facility is eligible for administrative approval. 
l.  No interference with existing television, cable television, radio signals, emergency communications services, or other electronic devices shall be permitted from the tower. If interference occurs, it shall be immediately remedied by the operators of the tower. 
m.  If a tower is abandoned, unused for two years, or no longer operable, it shall be removed within six months of its abandonment. If a tower is not dismantled as specified in this subsection, the city shall arrange to have the facility dismantled and will assess the landowner all costs associated with the removal of the tower. If the full amount due the city is not paid by the owner, or person in control of the property, or his or her agent, within 90 days of receipt of a bill from the city, the city finance director shall cause a special assessment to be recorded in the municipal lien docket. The recordation of such special assessment shall constitute a lien on the property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal and interest until final payment has been made. 
n.  That the owner of such tower shall provide proof to the city that the tower has undergone a triennial inspection for structural integrity. Said inspection is to be performed by a certified engineer, or other qualified professional, at the expense of the owner of the tower. If structural deterioration is found to be present, and such deterioration affects the physical stability or aesthetic integrity of the tower, the owner shall be required to correct such deterioration within a time limit to be established by the building department. 
In addition, the operator of such tower shall provide annual proof to the city that the tower has undergone field measurements to ensure compliance with all applicable Federal Communication Commission safety standards for exposure to nonionizing electromagnetic radiation. Such field measurements, and submission of the results to the city, shall be conducted upon start of the facility and annually thereafter, except that every third year, such proof of compliance shall be submitted on behalf of the operator by an independent nonionizing electromagnetic radiation evaluator. All such field measurements, and submission of the results, are to be performed by a certified engineer, or other qualified professional, at the expense of the operator. If such field measurements demonstrate noncompliance with Federal Communication Commission safety standards specified in this section, transmission at the facility shall be suspended until such time as full Federal Communication Commission safety standards compliance is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city. 
o.  The owner of such tower shall give proof to the city that any damages which may occur to surrounding properties or injury which may occur to persons, which damages or injuries are caused by a failure of the tower and/or its associated structural supports, regardless of whether such failure is a result of human error or an act of God, shall be paid by the owner of the tower and/or insurers of the tower. 
p.  Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be located upon a property, and/or on a building or structure that is listed on the National or Delaware Registers of Historic Places, included in section 7-19 of this Code pertaining to historic structures, or is described in the official historic structures and/or historic districts list maintained by the city. 
q.  Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be operated and maintained so as not to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under state law and the City Code, except in emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where such noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis only, but no more than 24 hours. 
r.  The city may assess appropriate and reasonable permit fees directly related to the city's actual costs in reviewing and processing the application for approval of a tower or antenna, as well as related inspection, monitoring, and related costs. 
s.  City residents and amateur radio operators utilizing satellite dishes, towers and antennas for the purpose of maintaining television, phone, radio and/or internet connections at their respective residences shall be exempt from the regulations enumerated in this section of the zoning ordinance.

The city shall comply with all federal timing requirements for the consideration of applications for new towers, as well as collocated antennas that fall under the Spectrum Act and/or the October 2014 Report and Order promulgated by the FCC. Tower applications shall be accompanied by a professional engineer's report containing the following: 
1.  A technical evaluation of the utilization of existing towers for telecommunications or other equipment intended for the installation on the proposed tower, as well as a propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed tower or other communication facilities and equipment, a description of the type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/radio equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band) assigned to the applicant, the power in watts at which the applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests conducted by the applicant in determining the need for the proposed site and installation. 
2.  A technical evaluation of the feasibility of attaching the tower or antenna to an existing, or previously approved, structure or wireless support structure, or sited on land owned and maintained by the City of Newark. A list of approved, municipally-owned buildings and parcels appropriate for wireless facilities placement is kept on file at the city planning and development office. Council may deny an application to construct a new tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount an antenna on an existing structure. The applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers within a one-quarter of a mile radius of the site proposed for the tower, sought permission to install an antenna on those structures, buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the following reasons: 
i.  The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a reasonable cost. 
ii.  The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for that existing building, structure, or tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost. 
iii.  Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended function. 
iv.  A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with the owner of such building, structure, or tower. 
3.  Certification that the proposed tower will fill a significant gap in wireless coverage or capacity that exists in the applicable area and that the type of wireless facility being proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill that gap in wireless coverage. The existence or non-existence of a gap in wireless coverage shall be a factor in the city's decision on an application for approval of a telecommunications tower. 
4.  Written certification of compliance with Federal Communications Commission Safety Standards for exposure to nonionizing electromagnetic radiation. 
5.  Copies of all applicable state and federal permits. 
6.  An engineering analysis of the proposed tower, including a summary of the proposed tower's capacity to provide space for future co-location by others. 
b.  Any principal part of the tower, excluding guy cables, shall be set back from the nearest property line of a church, library, school, nursing home, hospital, or lot zoned residential (RH, RT, RS, RD, RM, RR, and AC) not less than three times the height of the tower or 350 feet, whichever is greater. The setback shall be measured from the nearest point of the base of the tower to the nearest point of the property line of the protected use. If the applicant uses self-collapsing technology in its tower design, the setback from the nearest property line shall be one and a half times the height of the tower or 150 feet, which is greater. 
c.  No artificial light shall be installed upon any such tower unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration. If such light is required, it shall be screened so as not to project its light below the horizontal plane in which it is located. 
d.  Towers shall not exceed 175 feet in height unless a variance is successfully obtained by the applicant. Towers over 200 feet in height shall be guyed and not self-supporting nor consisting of lattice type structures, unless the applicant demonstrates that a guyed tower shall have a greater negative visual impact than a self-supporting tower. 
e.  To the extent permitted by applicable federal law and FCC regulations, towers located on existing buildings or structures shall not extend beyond 22 feet above the highest point of the building or structure. Accessory buildings or facilities for towers located on existing buildings or structures shall be located either in or on top of such buildings or structures. 
f.  The applicant shall submit a soil report to the city complying with the standards of Appendix I: Geotechnical Investigations, ANSI/EIA-222, as amended, to document and verify the design specifications of the foundation of the tower, and anchors for guy wires, if used. 
Landscaping shall be provided around the base of the tower and adjacent to a required security fence that shall be at least ten feet high. The landscaping shall consist of a minimum 25-foot wide planting strip with ground cover and/or grass, including at least one row of six foot high evergreen trees providing a solid screen adjacent or proximate to the fence, and 15 foot high, two inch caliper deciduous trees, interspersed within the buffer area and no more than 20 feet apart. Applicants may substitute alternative landscape plans that meet the purposes of this subsection to limit the visual impact of the lower portion of the tower and adjoining accessory facilities. Camouflaged towers designed to look like trees may be exempt from this subsection, subject to council approval. Towers located on top of buildings three stories or more in height and telecommunication antennas located on existing buildings shall be exempt from this subsection, except that a six-foot high solid evergreen screen shall be required between any telecommunications antenna or tower accessory building and adjoining properties. A ten-foot high security fence and an adjoining six-foot high solid evergreen screen adjacent or proximate to the fence shall be provided around the anchoring facilities for guy wires for guyed towers. 
g.  No outdoor storage shall be permitted at the tower site. 
h.  Unless otherwise required by the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Aviation Administration, towers shall be light gray in color. Camouflaged towers designed to look like trees or employing other alternative methods of stealth technology may be exempt from this subsection, subject to council approval. Telecommunication antennas with colors designed to match buildings or structures to which they are attached shall be exempt from this subsection. Towers shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment and shall maximize the use of a like facade to blend with the existing surroundings and neighboring buildings to the greatest extent possible. 
Council shall consider whether its decision upon the subject application will promote the harmonious and orderly development of the zoning district involved; encourage compatibility with the character and type of development existing in the area; benefit neighboring properties by preventing a negative impact on the aesthetic character of the community; preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site to the greatest possible extent; and encourage sound engineering design and construction principles, practices and techniques. 
i.  A tower shall be located so as not to encroach into any established public or private airport approach as established by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
j.  Towers higher than 100 feet must be a minimum of 2,000 feet from the nearest similar tower, measured from the base of the towers. 
k.  New telecommunications facilities may be attached to an approved tower without applying for an additional special use permit so long as the new facility does not substantially change the dimensions of the wireless support structure, or trigger any other exemption outlined by federal or state regulation. Antennas being sited on structures that do not already act as wireless support structures may be approved administratively, so long as they do not exceed ten feet in height and are constructed with a stealth design approved by council. To the extent permitted by state and federal law, as built drawings must be submitted to staff in advance of receiving such administrative approval, in order to determine whether the applicants proposed facility is eligible for administrative approval. 
l.  No interference with existing television, cable television, radio signals, emergency communications services, or other electronic devices shall be permitted from the tower. If interference occurs, it shall be immediately remedied by the operators of the tower. 
m.  If a tower is abandoned, unused for two years, or no longer operable, it shall be removed within six months of its abandonment. If a tower is not dismantled as specified in this subsection, the city shall arrange to have the facility dismantled and will assess the landowner all costs associated with the removal of the tower. If the full amount due the city is not paid by the owner, or person in control of the property, or his or her agent, within 90 days of receipt of a bill from the city, the city finance director shall cause a special assessment to be recorded in the municipal lien docket. The recordation of such special assessment shall constitute a lien on the property and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal and interest until final payment has been made. 
n.  That the owner of such tower shall provide proof to the city that the tower has undergone a triennial inspection for structural integrity. Said inspection is to be performed by a certified engineer, or other qualified professional, at the expense of the owner of the tower. If structural deterioration is found to be present, and such deterioration affects the physical stability or aesthetic integrity of the tower, the owner shall be required to correct such deterioration within a time limit to be established by the building department. 
In addition, the operator of such tower shall provide annual proof to the city that the tower has undergone field measurements to ensure compliance with all applicable Federal Communication Commission safety standards for exposure to nonionizing electromagnetic radiation. Such field measurements, and submission of the results to the city, shall be conducted upon start of the facility and annually thereafter, except that every third year, such proof of compliance shall be submitted on behalf of the operator by an independent nonionizing electromagnetic radiation evaluator. All such field measurements, and submission of the results, are to be performed by a certified engineer, or other qualified professional, at the expense of the operator. If such field measurements demonstrate noncompliance with Federal Communication Commission safety standards specified in this section, transmission at the facility shall be suspended until such time as full Federal Communication Commission safety standards compliance is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city. 
o.  The owner of such tower shall give proof to the city that any damages which may occur to surrounding properties or injury which may occur to persons, which damages or injuries are caused by a failure of the tower and/or its associated structural supports, regardless of whether such failure is a result of human error or an act of God, shall be paid by the owner of the tower and/or insurers of the tower. 
p.  Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be located upon a property, and/or on a building or structure that is listed on the National or Delaware Registers of Historic Places, included in section 7-19 of this Code pertaining to historic structures, or is described in the official historic structures and/or historic districts list maintained by the city. 
q.  Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be operated and maintained so as not to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under state law and the City Code, except in emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where such noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis only, but no more than 24 hours. 
r.  The city may assess appropriate and reasonable permit fees directly related to the city's actual costs in reviewing and processing the application for approval of a tower or antenna, as well as related inspection, monitoring, and related costs. 
s.  City residents and amateur radio operators utilizing satellite dishes, towers and antennas for the purpose of maintaining television, phone, radio and/or internet connections at their respective residences shall be exempt from the regulations enumerated in this section of the zoning ordinance.

1.  A technical evaluation of the utilization of existing towers for telecommunications or other equipment intended for the installation on the proposed tower, as well as a propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed tower or other communication facilities and equipment, a description of the type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/radio equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band) assigned to the applicant, the power in watts at which the applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests conducted by the applicant in determining the need for the proposed site and installation. 
2.  A technical evaluation of the feasibility of attaching the tower or antenna to an existing, or previously approved, structure or wireless support structure, or sited on land owned and maintained by the City of Newark. A list of approved, municipally-owned buildings and parcels appropriate for wireless facilities placement is kept on file at the city planning and development office. Council may deny an application to construct a new tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount an antenna on an existing structure. The applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers within a one-quarter of a mile radius of the site proposed for the tower, sought permission to install an antenna on those structures, buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the following reasons: 
i.  The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a reasonable cost. 
ii.  The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for that existing building, structure, or tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost. 
iii.  Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended function. 
iv.  A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached with the owner of such building, structure, or tower. 
3.  Certification that the proposed tower will fill a significant gap in wireless coverage or capacity that exists in the applicable area and that the type of wireless facility being proposed is the least intrusive means by which to fill that gap in wireless coverage. The existence or non-existence of a gap in wireless coverage shall be a factor in the city's decision on an application for approval of a telecommunications tower.

(a)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, or general welfare; for the lessening of congestion in the streets or roads or reducing the waste of excessive amounts of roads; for securing safety from fire and other dangers, providing adequate light and air, preventing on the one hand excessive concentration of population and on the other hand, excessive and wasteful scattering of population or settlement; for promoting such distribution of population and such classification of land uses and distribution of land development and utilization as will tend to facilitate and provide adequate provisions for public requirements, transportation, water, and flowage, water supply, drainage, sanitation, educational opportunities, recreation, soil fertility, and food supply; and for protection of the tax base, securing economy in governmental expenditures, fostering the state's agricultural and other industries, and the protection of both urban and non-urban developments. 
(b)  It is not intended by the chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul, or in any way to impair or interfere with any existing law or any rules or regulations regulating the use or construction of buildings, the provisions of yards, courts, other open spaces, or the provisions of sanitary facilities; provided, however, that where the provisions of this chapter require large yards or courts, lesser heights or bulks of buildings, or more excessive sanitary facilities than do the aforementioned laws, rules, or regulations, the provisions of this chapter shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 70-31, Art. XX, § 1, 7-21-70) 
Sec. 32-74. - Enforcement and penalties.

In the event of such objection, he shall transmit all papers in connection with said application to the board of adjustment, in accordance with Article XIX, Section 32-66 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 70-31, Art. XX, § 3, 7-21-70) 
Sec. 32-76. - Filing of plans and supplementary material. 
    In those cases where a building permit is required under the building code, plans for the construction, alteration, or enlargement, wholly or partly, of any building or structure shall be filed as prescribed by said building code. These shall be accompanied by a preliminary application to the building inspector for a certificate of occupancy, as required in the following section. Such application shall be accompanied by two copies of a map or plan drawn to scale and showing the location of existing building(s) thereon, the lines within which the proposed building(s) is (are) to be erected or altered and the existing and intended use of each building or part thereof, the height thereof, and the number of families intended to be accommodated. The applicant shall also give such other pertinent information respecting the proposed use of property as may be necessary to determine the propriety of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy upon completion of any construction involved. 
(Ord. No. 70-31, Art. XX, § 4, 7-21-70) 
Sec. 32-77. - Certificate of occupancy. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful to use or permit the use of any building, structure, or premises or part thereof, hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, altered, or enlarged, wholly or partly, in use or structure, except for minor alterations involving no change in the floor area or use, until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued therefor by the building inspector. The issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall show that the building, structure, or premises, or part thereof, and the proposed use thereof, are in conformity with the provisions of this chapter or an order of the board of adjustment. 
(b)  Upon written request from the owner, the code enforcement officer within five working days shall issue a certificate of occupancy for any building or premises existing at the time of adoption of this chapter, or any changes or amendments thereto, certifying after inspection and investigation the extent and kind of use made of the building or premises, and whether such use conforms to the provisions of this chapter or is deemed a nonconforming use. If a certificate of occupancy is denied, the code enforcement officer shall issue a letter stating the reasons for refusal. 
(Ord. No. 70-31, Art. XX, § 5, 7-21-70) 
Sec. 32-78. - Special use permit. 
(a)  The following procedures shall apply governing the implementation of special use permits: 
(1)  Special use permits may be issued for any of the conditional uses for which a special use permit is required by the provisions of this chapter; provided that the council shall find, after a duly advertised hearing held in accordance with the provisions of Article XXI, Section 32-80, that the applicant has demonstrated the conditional use will not: 
a.  Affect adversely the health or safety of person(s) residing or working within the City of Newark boundaries or within one mile of the City of Newark boundaries and within the State of Delaware; 
b.  Be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements within the City of Newark boundaries or within one mile of the City of Newark boundaries and within the State of Delaware; and 
c.  Be in conflict with the purposes of the comprehensive development plan of the city. 
    In granting any special use permit the council shall designate such conditions in connections therewith as will, in its opinion, assure that the use will conform to the foregoing requirements and that such use will continue to do so. 
(2)  Construction or operation shall be commenced within one year of date of issuance or a special use permit shall become void. "Construction," as that term is employed in this section, shall mean that a valid building permit has been issued and work called for in the permit has begun. Expiration of a building permit or abandonment of the work sanctioned by the permit, or the failure to commence work during the one year time period immediately subsequent to the issuance of a special use permit, shall mean that the permit becomes void. "Operation," as that term is employed in this section, shall refer to those uses for which building permits are not required. For such uses, operation shall mean that a valid certificate of occupancy has been issued and the use has become open and available for the public. 
(3)  A reapplication for a special use permit for the same lot shall not be considered by the council within a period of 360 days from its last consideration. This provision, however, shall not impair the right of the council to propose a special use permit on its own motion. 
(4)  Written application for a special use permit, plans, and supporting materials shall be filed with the planning department. Every application shall be accompanied by a fee, indicated in subsection 32-3.1(a)(2)a, for residential districts and a fee, indicated in subsection 32-3.1(a)(2)b, for university, business, and industrial districts. All applications for uses proposed to be constructed on properties one acre or more in size shall be referred to the planning commission for consideration and recommendation; all other applications shall be forwarded directly to council for consideration. The time of council hearing shall be within one month of the special use permit application filing date for properties less than one acre in size; the time of the hearing for properties larger than one acre shall be within one month of the planning commission recommendations. A reasonable effort shall be made to give 10 days' notice by mail of planning commission and/or city council public hearings to all property owners of record, according to ownership data available at Newark, whose property is immediately adjacent to or within 300 feet of the property for which the special use permit is requested.

2.  Mounted on two-inch galvanized posts driven in the ground to a depth of two feet and at no more than ten-foot centers or if hard surfaces (asphalt, concrete, etc.) are present, mounted on metal panel foot stands. 
3.  Provide a three-foot wide opening for tree care and maintenance. 
4.  Fencing to remain in place until the final inspection of the project. 
5.  Two warning signs are to be prominently displayed on each protective fence. The signs shall be a minimum of ten by 12 inches and read as follows: 
TREE PROTECTION ZONE 
THIS FENCE SHALL NOT BE REMOVED 
6.  The signs are to be produced from a material that will not weather, fade or become dislodged. 
7.  Any work within the tree protection zone requires approval from the parks and recreation director. 
8.  No storage of materials, topsoil, vehicles, construction debris or other equipment shall be permitted within the tree protection zone. 
9.  Tree protection zones must be clearly and accurately displayed on all landscape plans. 
f.  If during construction a valued tree which is identified to be preserved is removed without the parks and recreation director's authorization, the developer shall make a payment to the city's beautification fund in the amount of $5,000.00 and follow the replacement requirement as listed in subsection (5)(d) above. In addition, if as a result of construction a valued tree which is identified to be preserved is damaged the parks and recreation director may require the developer to have an independent certified arborist evaluate the tree and provide a written report and recommendation on the tree's current condition and its future disposition. If the tree can be repaired, the developer will be responsible to do so adhering to the arborist's analysis and/or accepted International Society of Arboricultural Standards. If it is determined that the tree must be removed, the developer shall remove the tree, make the contribution to the city's beautification fund and following the same replacement requirements. 
g.  Every effort shall be made to avoid placing utilities within the critical root zone of trees identified to be preserved. To preserve the natural environment and protect designated valued trees, tunnel borings shall be required when underground utilities must be placed within the critical root zone of said valued trees. The following tunnel boring depths are to be observed: 
1.  Trunk DBH less than 12 inches: 24 inches. 
2.  Trunk DBH 12 inches or more: 36 inches. 
h.  Landscape and tree preservation plans shall be evaluated by the parks and recreation department on a case by case basis that shall entail examining the existing tree resources on the site and take into account the dynamics of trees and construction impacts, in order to create a plan that results in a balanced mixture of tree species and tree age. The goal of each review is to insure that through a combination of preservation and landscaping, the final landscape and tree preservation plan produces a diversified and sustainable urban landscape. 
(6)  If requested by the parks and recreation director, minor subdivisions shall include an existing tree protection plan as described in subsection (5)e. above.

Sec. 32-95. - General provisions. 
(a)  The official zoning map, adopted as part of this chapter, includes within the special flood hazard area, formerly known as the open floodway district (OFD), those areas of the city which are subject to the 100-year flood, as shown on the flood insurance rate map that accompanies the flood insurance study prepared for the city by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated February 4, 2015, or the most recent revision thereof. 
(b)  Interpretation of district boundaries. The boundaries of the special flood hazard area (SFHA), formerly known as the open floodway district (OFD), shall be determined by using the flood frequency profiles provided in the flood insurance study. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, the planning director and director of public works shall make the necessary interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the district boundary shall have the burden of establishing that such land does not lie within the special flood hazard area as defined in this article. 
(c)  Changes in the special flood hazard area. The delineation of the special flood hazard area, formerly known as the open floodway district (OFD), as shown on the official zoning map, can be revised and modified by the city council where there are changes through natural or other causes in the general floodplain or where changes can be validated by further detailed engineering studies employing on-site survey techniques with the prior approval of the Federal Insurance Administration. 
(d)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the special flood hazard area, formerly known as the open floodway district (OFD), boundaries or land uses permitted or existing within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
