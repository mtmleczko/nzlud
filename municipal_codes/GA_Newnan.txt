PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City Newnan, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through January 25, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Ronald McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. C. Bradford Sears, Jr., City Attorney, and Mr. Richard A. Bolin, City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Section 1.6. - Extension of water, sewerage, and electrical distribution systems beyond corporate limits. 
(a)  The City of Newnan, by and through its water, sewerage and light commission, is authorized and empowered to extend its water, sewerage, and electrical distributions systems and all necessary appurtenances by which said utilities are distributed, without and beyond the corporate limits of the City of Newnan; and to provide utility services to persons, firms, and corporations outside said corporate limits under such provisions as the water, sewerage, and light commissioners of the city may prescribe; and to extend its water and sewerage service without and beyond Coweta County under such provisions as the water, sewerage, and light commissioners may prescribe; to classify rates to be charged in such area beyond the said corporate limits; and to make such contracts, agreements, and arrangements as it deems necessary or desirable for the said purpose.

The mayor and council of the city shall have power to pass such ordinances as they deem suitable to protect said property and appurtenances and to enforce compliance therewith by suitable penalties. Any person or persons in any way interfering with or injuring said systems or any part thereof shall be amenable to the laws and ordinances of the city.

f.  Require that submission of any requested cost proposals or elements of cost be in a concealed format and separate from technical/qualifications proposals as these shall not be considered in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase; and 
g.  Provide a schedule of key dates for the procurement process and establish a submittal deadline for responses to the RFP which provides sufficient time for interested consultants to receive notice, prepare, and submit a proposal, which except in unusual circumstances shall be not less than 14 days from the date of issuance of the RFP. 
(3)  Evaluation factors. 
a.  Criteria used for evaluation, ranking, and selection of consultants to perform engineering and design related services must assess the demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services solicited. These qualifications-based factors may include, but are not limited to, technical approach (e.g., project understanding, innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance. 
b.  Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. All price or cost related items which include, but are not limited to, cost proposals, direct salaries/wage rates, indirect cost rates, and other direct costs are prohibited from being used as evaluation criteria. 
c.  In-state or local preference shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. State licensing laws are not preempted by this provision and professional licensure within a jurisdiction may be established as a requirement which attests to the minimum qualifications and competence of a consultant to perform the solicited services. 
d.  The following non-qualifications based evaluation criteria are permitted under the specified conditions and provided the combined total of these criteria do not exceed a nominal value of ten percent of the total evaluation criteria to maintain the integrity of a qualifications-based selection: 
1.  A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criterion shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a consultant to provide a local presence, a local presence will add value to the quality and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified consultants, given the nature and size of the project. If a consultant outside of the locality area indicates as part of a proposal that it will satisfy the criteria in some manner, such as establishing a local project office, that commitment shall be considered to have satisfied the local presence criteria. 
2.  The participation of qualified and certified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) sub-consultants may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate in accordance with 49 CFR Part 26 and the City of Newnan's FHWA-approved DBE program. 
(4)  Evaluation, ranking, and selection. 
a.  Consultant proposals shall be evaluated by the City of Newnan based on the criteria established and published within the public solicitation. 
b.  While the contract will be with the prime consultant, proposal evaluations shall consider the qualifications of the prime consultant and any sub-consultants identified within the proposal with respect to the scope of work and established criteria. 
c.  Following submission and evaluation of proposals, the City of Newnan shall conduct interviews or other types of discussions determined three of the most highly qualified consultants to clarify the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities provided in response to the RFP. Discussion requirements shall be specified within the RFP and should be based on the size and complexity of the project as defined in City of Newnan written policies and procedures (as specified in 23 CFR Part 172.5(c)). Discussions may be written, by telephone, video conference, or by oral presentation/interview. Discussions following proposal submission are not required provided proposals contain sufficient information for evaluation of technical approach and qualifications to perform the specific project, task, or service with respect to established criteria. 
d.  From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions which have been conducted, the City of Newnan shall rank, in order of preference, at least three consultants determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria. 
e.  Notification must be provided to responding consultants of the final ranking of the three most highly qualified consultants. 
f.  The City of Newnan shall retain acceptable documentation of the solicitation, proposal, evaluation, and selection of the consultant accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR Part 18.42. 
(5)  Negotiation. 
a.  Independent estimate. Prior to receipt or review of the most highly qualified consultant's cost proposal, the City of Newnan shall prepare a detailed independent estimate with an appropriate breakdown of the work or labor hours, types or classifications of labor required, other direct costs, and consultant's fixed fee for the defined scope of work. The independent estimate shall serve as the basis for negotiation and ensuring the consultant services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost. 
b.  Elements of contract costs (e.g., indirect cost rates, direct salary or wage rates, fixed fee, and other direct costs) shall be established separately in accordance with 23 CFR Part 172.11. 
c.  If concealed cost proposals were submitted in conjunction with technical/qualifications proposals, only the cost proposal of the consultant with which negotiations are initiated may be considered. Concealed cost proposals of consultants with which negotiations are not initiated should be returned to the respective consultant due to the confidential nature of this data (as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(E)). 
d.  The City of Newnan shall retain documentation of negotiation activities and resources used in the analysis of costs to establish elements of the contract in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR Part 18.42. This documentation shall include the consultant cost certification and documentation supporting the acceptance of the indirect cost rate to be applied to the contract (as specified in 23 CFR Part 172.11(c)). 
(b)  Small purchases. The small purchase method involves procurement of engineering and design related services where an adequate number of qualified sources are reviewed and the total contract costs do not exceed an established simplified acquisition threshold. The City of Newnan may use the state's small purchase procedures which reflect applicable State laws and regulations for the procurement of engineering and design related services provided the total contract costs do not exceed the federal simplified acquisition threshold (as specified in 48 CFR Part 2.101). When a lower threshold for use of small purchase procedures is established in State law, regulation, or policy, the lower threshold shall apply to the use of FAHP funds. The following additional requirements shall apply to the small purchase procurement method: 
(1)  The scope of work, project phases, and contract requirements shall not be broken down into smaller components merely to permit the use of small purchase procedures. 
(2)  A minimum of three consultants are required to satisfy the adequate number of qualified sources reviewed. 
(3)  Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with state small purchase procedures; however, the allow ability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the federal cost principles. 
(4)  The full amount of any contract modification or amendment that would cause the total contract amount to exceed the established simplified acquisition threshold would be ineligible for Federal-aid funding. The FHWA may withdraw all federal-aid from a contract if it is modified or amended above the applicable established simplified acquisition threshold. 
(c)  Noncompetitive. The noncompetitive method involves procurement of engineering and design related services when it is not feasible to award the contract using competitive negotiation or small purchase procurement methods. The following requirements shall apply to the noncompetitive procurement method: 
(1)  The City of Newnan may use their own noncompetitive procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations and conform to applicable federal requirements. 
(2)  The City of Newnan shall establish a process to determine when noncompetitive procedures will be used and shall submit justification to, and receive approval from, the FHWA before using this form of contracting. 
(3)  Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by noncompetitive procedures are limited to the following: 
a.  The service is available only from a single source; 
b.  There is an emergency which will not permit the time necessary to conduct competitive negotiations; or 
c.  After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined to be inadequate. 
(4)  Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with the City of Newnan noncompetitive procedures; however, the allow ability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the federal cost principles. 
[(d)]  Additional procurement requirements. 
(1)  Common grant rule. 
a.  The City of Newnan must comply with procurement requirements established in state and local laws, regulations, policies, and procedures which are not addressed by or in conflict with applicable federal laws and regulations (as specified in 49 CFR Part 18.36). 
b.  When state and local procurement laws, regulations, policies, or procedures are in conflict with applicable federal laws and regulations, the City of Newnan must comply with Federal requirements to be eligible for federal-aid reimbursement of the associated costs of the services incurred following FHWA authorization (as specified in 49 CFR Part 18.4). 
(2)  Disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) program. 
a.  The City of Newnan shall give consideration to DBE consultants in the procurement of engineering and design related service contracts subject to 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2) in accordance with 49 CFR Part 26. When DBE program participation goals cannot be met through race-neutral measures, additional DBE participation on engineering and design related services contracts may be achieved in accordance with the City of Newnan's FHWA approved DBE program through either: 
1.  Use of an evaluation criterion in the qualifications-based selection of consultants (as specified in 23 CFR Part 172.7(a)(1)(iii)(D)); or 
2.  Establishment of a contract participation goal. 
b.  The use of quotas or exclusive set-asides for DBE consultants is prohibited (as specified in 49 CFR Part 26.43). 
(3)  Suspension and debarment. The City of Newnan must verify suspension and debarment actions and eligibility status of consultants and sub-consultants prior to entering into an agreement or contract in accordance with 49 CFR Part 18.35 and 2 CFR Part 180.

Sec. 10-54. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 10-54(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMP. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site and preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters and waters beyond the levels specified in this section. 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair, or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; of which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as long an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream, crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 10-54(b) and (c) of this article. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
( Ord. No. 16-15, 11-22-16 ) 
Sec. 10-55. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirement. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Newnan without first obtaining a permit from the Building Official of the City of Newnan to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be made in the name of the owner of property, holding record title. Any agent making application for an owner shall provide written designation of his authority. The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building official and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan, with supporting date, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the date specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 10-54 of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by ten copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan prepare or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
(3)  A fee shall be charged for each application, and no application shall be deemed complete unless the requisite fee is paid at time of filing The amount of required fee shall be set forth in a fee schedule, maintained in the office of the building official, as from time to time revised by resolution of the city council. 
(4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 10-54 has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 10-55(b)(7), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of a surety bond issued by a company licensed in the State of Georgia and returnable to the City of Newnan, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 10-54 of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 10-54 are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 10-55(b)(7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  A permit issued under this article shall not be valid for work commencing more than six months after its issuance date. Where work is not timely commenced, or work on the project is suspended for more than three months after commencement, the local issuing authority shall automatically suspend the permit, until the applicant provides a statement from a registered or certified professional in engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, land surveying, or erosion and sedimentation control, certifying that, based upon diligent investigation, no material changes have occurred since the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan was originally approved. 
(7)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
( Ord. No. 16-15, 11-22-16 ) 
Sec. 10-56. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The city engineer or his designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served immediately upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The city engineer or his designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority.

( Ord. No. 16-15, 11-22-16 ) 
Sec. 10-57. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining a required permit, the person shall be subject to the revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that all land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning. 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 03-15, § 1, adopted June 26, 2003 , repealed the former Art. IV, §§ 10-81-10-86, and enacted a new Art. IV as set out herein. The former Art. IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 00-01, § 1, adopted January 11, 2000; Ord. No. 00-36, adopted Nov. 14, 2000. 

Sec. 10-81. - Purpose. 
    This tree preservation and landscaping ordinance has been developed to benefit the environmental and aesthetic quality of the City of Newnan. The intent is to create an opportunity and promote preservation of the city's natural resources and grow in a way that will provide a healthy environment for Newnan's future. The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development process; to prevent massive grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without provision for replacement of trees; and to protect trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within the City of Newnan. The regulations of this tree preservation and landscaping ordinance shall be the definitive, unless otherwise directed by the Zoning Ordinance or City Code. The benefits derived from this article include: 
(1)  Provide visual buffering and enhance beautification of the city; 
(2)  Moderation of storm water runoff, and improved water quality; 
(3)  Protect and attempt to enhance property values, thus safeguarding private and public investment; 
(4)  Protect the unique identity of Newnan by promoting native plants and the use of the city's signature plant palette; 
(5)  Control soil erosion; 
(6)  Reduction of some air pollutants and interception of airborne particulate matter; 
(7)  Preserve stands of trees and "specimen" trees; and 
(8)  Protect natural vegetation except where its removal is necessary for responsible property development or control of disease and infestation. This article shall serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing of land and its disturbance, so as to preserve, insofar as possible, the natural and existing growth of vegetation, and to replace whenever possible the removed foliage with new vegetation.

    The city landscape architect, as part of the review team, will conduct a preliminary review of all rezoning cases and special use permit applications. Conditions to rezoning will be applied where determined necessary by the preliminary review. These conditions may be either general, or specific in nature, and will reflect the standards or provisions of this article and the zoning ordinance. Compliance to these conditions will be verified by review of a revised site plan prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit. 
    Developers and design professionals may meet at any time with the city landscape architect to discuss the tree preservation planning process. The city landscape architect is available for field inspections of site conditions prior to submittal to assist in the design process as it relates to preserving trees. Information can also be disseminated about how to prepare a tree protection and/or landscape plan for submittal in order to minimize plan review time. 
(1)  Permitting process. 
a.  Prior to the submission of any permit drawings, the applicant is encouraged to meet with the city landscape architect to discuss the tree protection/landscape ordinance as it relates to the applicant's property. The purpose of the pre submittal conference is to clarify the provisions and procedures of the ordinance and review applicable standards and guidelines for the submittal of documents, and required tree protection, replacement, and maintenance measures. 
b.  Tree protection plan and a landscape plan, three copies, either as separate or combined drawings, along with other permit drawings, are to be submitted as part of the plan approval and/or land disturbance permit process to the City of Newnan Planning Department. These plans will be reviewed by the city landscape architect for compliance with the City of Newnan Zoning Ordinance and this article in particular and either approved, denied, or returned for revisions. Any comments will be made available to the designer for response or revision to the drawings. The plans shall then be resubmitted (along with previous red line comments), with the necessary changes, following the same procedure as if it were an original application. Issuance of a land disturbance permit is contingent upon approval of the tree protection plan/landscape plan. 
(2)  Procedures. 
a.  All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to any land disturbance, and the city landscape architect shall be contacted for a pre-construction conference prior to any land disturbance. To adequately protect the site, tree save areas shall be delineated in the field with tree protection fencing. Land disturbance may proceed only after a permit is obtained and tree protection measures have been installed and approved by the city landscape architect. The city landscape architect will conduct unscheduled inspections during construction to ensure compliance with the approved tree protection plan. The city landscape architect shall have the authority to stop work on a development if site activities do not comply with the approved tree protection plan and/or this article. 
b.  A tree removal permit is required to remove any tree larger than eight inches in diameter from any property. There will be a fee for obtaining a tree removal permit based on the number of trees to be removed. Some tree removal permits may be granted without a tree removal fee in accordance with section 10-84(9) of this article. If any significant trees are removed from any property without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the tree removal fee calculated. Minimum required site tree densities must be maintained at all times. Failure to maintain the required tree densities may result in re-plantings. 
c.  Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city landscape architect will be replaced by trees equaling a two times an inch for inch replacement of the tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be three-inch minimum caliper. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city landscape architect. 
d.  In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 60 months following completion of development, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) having an inch for inch replacement of the specimen tree removed on the site as approved by the city landscape architect. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this article. 
e.  An approved tree protection/landscape plan must be implemented prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. When the developer/owner has installed the required landscaping improvements, he shall request an inspection by the city landscape architect. If the city landscape architect approves the installation, the developer will then post a two-year landscape establishment bond. After the landscape establishment bond has been received, the project will then be released for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If the city landscape architect does not approve the plan, he shall submit a report stating his reasons for disapproval so that the developer can make the necessary corrections. After the corrections have been made, a re-inspection shall be requested. 
f.  At the end of the two-year landscape establishment period, the city landscape architect shall inspect the site and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such finding, the bond shall be released. In absence of such finding, the bond shall not be released and the owner of the property shall be notified to replace the unhealthy trees and landscaping or take other appropriate action as approved by the city landscape architect. Upon failure of the owner to comply with the city landscape architect's decision regarding such trees, the city shall use the bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance. Final inspection shall be scheduled within ten working days' notice. 
g.  Trees, which are used to meet the tree density requirements, shall be fully maintained for an additional five years after the date of final landscape establishment inspection. It is the responsibility of the property owner to water, fertilize and treat trees in order to maintain tree health and vigor. The property owner shall, at all times, maintain the required tree density. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this article. Trees which have been used to meet the tree density requirements shall not be removed at any time without approval of the city landscape architect. Removal of such trees will result in replacement of like kind and size. 
h.  It shall be the duty of the city landscape architect to enforce the provisions and requirements of this article. The city landscape architect shall have the authority to revoke, suspend, or void any land disturbance permit and shall have the authority to suspend all work on a site or a portion thereof. 
i.  Land clearing for clearly agricultural purposes, including legitimate timber harvesting; plant or tree nurseries; orchards, is exempt. However, this exemption shall not be interpreted to include tree harvesting incidental to the development of land, or tree harvesting on land that is anticipated to be developed for non horticultural uses. All legitimate timber harvesting shall be required to provide a 50-foot undisturbed buffer provided and maintained along the entire perimeter of the property, including road frontages, during the land disturbance activity, except for authorized access crossings. Once tree harvesting takes place in conformity with the above regulations, no development of the property shall be permitted that would require the cutting of trees preserved for a period of five years following the timber harvesting. No timber harvesting shall be undertaken on any non residential parcel of land unless the transitional buffer zones required by the zoning regulations of the district in which located, are preserved in a natural and undisturbed state. 
( Ord. No. 03-15, § 1, 6-26-03 ) 
Sec. 10-84. - Tree preservation and protection. 
    The trees in Newnan are a city resource worth protecting and maintaining. Existing trees shall not be disturbed, except as outlined in this article. No person shall cut carve or otherwise damage any tree. No person shall attach rope, wire, nails, or advertising posters to any tree. No person shall set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree. Any large, rare, or historically significant trees on a project site shall be highlighted by the designer (see specimen trees, section 10-84(6)). It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. (Reasonable effort shall include, but not limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities). Careful thought and consideration is expected to be given to saving trees in the development process. 
    In the plan review process of a proposed project, the first indicator of how well trees have been incorporated in the design process is how will the proposed development impact specimen trees. These trees are considered on an individual basis and a proposal to remove any of them is carefully scrutinized. Another indicator is how will the proposed development impact smaller, significant trees. These trees are typically considered in mass as they relate to the overall preservation of the natural character of the site. Removals which are not adequately justified may require site plan alterations. 
    The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward meeting the site density factor on a property. 
(1)  Planning considerations. Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the site development process. The root system can easily extend beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. The root system within the dripline region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this zone can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these critical root zones the following planning considerations should be applied: 
a.  The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall organization as related to tree protection. 
b.  The protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the furthest canopy dripline of the tree(s). 
c.  Tree preservation and grading requirements are two design constraints, which are most often in conflict. A grade change of a few inches can be detrimental to a tree, yet most sites require extensive cut and fill in order to manage drainage. The use of berms or retaining walls, instead of cutting, to provide detention can be used to preserve significant trees. Detention ponds can be designed around significant trees by adding depth to minimize width where possible. Retaining walls can also be used to mitigate cuts and fills. Tree wells and/or aeration systems can also be provided for trees in areas of fill. 
d.  Underground water and wastewater lines, storm sewers, irrigation lines and both underground and overhead electric and telephone lines can have a considerable impact on trees. The layout of the project site utility plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities should be placed along corridors between tree protective zones. Developers shall coordinate the location of utility lines, including irrigation and electric lighting, with the utility companies in order to prevent root damage within the critical root zones of protected trees and to minimize damage to trees located in protected zones. 
e.  Construction activities such as parking, material storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc. shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protective zones. No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval of the city landscape architect. 
f.  Sidewalks often appear innocuous on plans, but can be very detrimental to trees due to grading requirements. Considerations should be given to move sidewalks as far from tree trunks as possible and provide a finished grade above the existing grade for sidewalks required in close proximity to a tree trunk. Drainage can be routed under sidewalks where an elevated grade is required. 
(2)  Protection of existing trees. 
a.  Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including, but not limited to: 
1.  Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials; 
2.  Root disturbance due to cuts, fills, or trenching; 
3.  Wounds to exposed roots, trunks, or limbs by mechanical equipment; 
4.  Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc. 
b.  Trees identified to be preserved and counted as credit towards meeting required site tree density shall have a four foot tree protection fencing installed at the critical root zones. For methods of tree protection, see section 10-84(3)a.-g. All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to the start of any land disturbance and maintained until final landscaping is installed. No construction activities are to occur within tree protection areas. Areas designated for parking, materials and equipment storage or staging areas are to be located outside of the drip line of existing trees. 
c.  The city landscape architect will conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and during clearing, construction, and post construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this article. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. Failure to comply with and/or maintain approved tree protection measures may result in a stop work order issued by the city landscape architect. 
(3)  Methods of tree protection. The root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. The following section describes ways to help control unnecessary encroachment on existing trees. These methods and guidelines will be followed for tree protection throughout all phases of construction. These guidelines are designed to reduce damage to critical root zones and wounds to exposed roots, trunks, and limbs by chemical, mechanical, and other means. Tree protection areas will be delineated on tree protection plan and methods of protection will be clearly noted and detailed. 
a.  Active protective barriers. Barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely around the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, prior to any land disturbance. Deviations from this must be approved on an individual basis by the city landscape architect. Barriers will be a minimum four feet high, constructed in a post and rail configuration. A two-inch by four-inch post and a one-inch by four-inch rail, with the post no further than six feet apart, is recommended. Chain link fence with the same post spacing, is also acceptable. All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced in area. All tree fencing shall be maintained throughout the land disturbance and building construction, and should not be removed until all construction and landscaping is complete. 
b.  Passive protective barriers. Tree save areas and their critical root zones not within 60 feet of any grading, storage, construction or traffic areas may be protected by four foot orange laminated plastic safety fencing. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity. 
c.  Boring. No open trenching will be allowed within the protected zone as defined by the protective barricades. All underground utilities to be installed within this protection zone shall be installed by boring underneath the root zone. Any exceptions must be approved by the city landscape architect. Utilities may be tunneled in the root zone at a 24-inch minimum depth providing that plans are approved showing the location and method. 
d.  Filling/clearing within root zone. Fill dirt no deeper than two inches may be allowed within the drip line of the tree. No grubbing is permitted in the root zone. In the protected root zone, any stumps, dead trees and shrub growth to be removed shall be cut flush or ground out. Stump grinding will be accomplished with equipment and methods acceptable in normal arboriculture operations. All holes will be backfilled completely the same day of the operation. 
e.  Soil compaction. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials storage, the tree protection zone must first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of shredded hardwood mulch, or a six-inch layer of pine straw. 
f.  Clearing activities. Roots often fuse and tangle amongst trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two foot trenches (e.g. with a ditch witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, the roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees. The cutting down and then grinding the stump of the adjacent removed trees, as opposed to bulldozing them and ripping their roots, can also aid the protected trees. 
g.  Tree removal. To minimize potential root loss from soil disturbance in an overlapping root situation. All roots attached to a tree inside a tree save area that extend outside the tree save areas shall be cut by hand if the soil is to be disturbed. The removal of any tree adjacent to a tree within a tree save area shall not be removed by heavy equipment. Cutting the roots by hand or with a ditch witch is acceptable. 
(4)  Tree protection plan. Any proposal for development or improvement of any tract of land shall include a tree protection/landscape plan, including trees to be planted in order to meet the minimum requirements of this section. Such plan shall be submitted, along with other permit drawings, to the City of Newnan Building Department prior to any clearing, grubbing, grading or other removal of the existing vegetation that may affect the health of existing tree coverage. No tree removal shall occur prior to approval of the tree protection plan. The tree protection plan may be submitted as part of the landscape plan, provided that all required information is legible, or as a separate drawing which includes, as a minimum, the following: 
a.  Name, address, and phone number of owner of record and applicant. 
b.  Boundary lines of the tract by lengths and bearings, streets adjoining the property, total area of the tract, land lot, land district, north point, graphic scale, and date. 
c.  Approximate location of all specimen trees and tneir critical root zones. Indicate those specimen trees proposed for removal or for preservation. Removal of specimen trees is subject to city landscape architect's approval. 
d.  Approximate location of all trees or stands of trees proposed to be protected. Only trees that are designated on the tree protection plan will be counted towards density requirements. 
e.  Exact location of specimen trees when their preservation is questionable, or might result in a change of the site design. 
f.  Location of proposed buildings, structures and paved areas. 
g.  Locations of all existing and proposed utility lines. (Utility lines must be placed along corridors between critical root zones of trees which will remain on the site.) 
h.  Limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading, and trenching. 
i.  Limits of tree protection areas, showing trees to be maintained and planted, specifying species and size. 
j.  Grade changes or other work adjacent to a tree, which would effect it adversely, with drawings or descriptions as to how the grade, drainage, and aeration will be maintained around the tree. 
k.  Methods of tree protection shall be indicated for all tree protection zones, including tree fencing, erosion control, retaining walls, tunneling for utilities, aeration systems, transplanting, staking, signage, etc. 
l.  Procedures and schedules for the implementation, installation, and maintenance of all tree protection measures. 
m.  Plan should indicate staging areas for parking, materials storage, concrete washout, and debris burn where these areas might affect tree protection. 
n.  The required site tree density factor must be satisfied. Compliance shall be clearly demonstrated on the tree protection plan. Existing trees or stands of trees used in the density calculation must be clearly indicated on the drawing. A summary table of the number of existing trees to remain and new trees to be planted, by diameter shall be shown along with the calculations showing tree density achieved for the site. 
o.  Additional information as required on a case by case basis. This could include, but is not limited to, a certified arborist's appraisal of the tree's viability and projected life span. 
p.  The following notes shall be indicated on both the tree protection plan and the grading plan in large bold letters. 
1.  CONTACT THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AT (770) 254-2354 TO ARRANGE A PRE-CONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE WITH THE CITY LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT PRIOR TO ANY LAND DISTURBANCE. 
2.  ALL TREE PROTECTION MEASURES SHALL BE INSTALLED AND INSPECTED PRIOR TO THE START OF ANY LAND DISTURBANCE AND MAINTAINED UNTIL FINAL LANDSCAPING IS INSTALLED. CALL THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AT (770) 254-2354 FOR AN INSPECTION BY THE CITY LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT. 
3.  NO PARKING, STORAGE, OR ANY OTHER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE TO OCCUR WITHIN TREE PROTECTION AREAS. 
4.  A MAINTENANCE INSPECTION OF TREES WILL BE PERFORMED AFTER TWO FULL GROWING SEASONS FROM THE DATE OF THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION. PROJECT OWNERS AT THE TIME OF THE MAINTENANCE INSPECTION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ORDINANCE COMPLIANCE. 
(5)  Determination of site density factor. 
a.  All projects within the City of Newnan, with the exception of the construction of individual single family and detached dwellings, shall maintain or exceed a minimum site density factor of 16 units per acre. The term "unit" is not synonymous with "tree". The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article, or some combination of the two. All trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried. The site density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. Minimum tree site density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in this section. The trees, both retained and new, where feasible shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve results following professional landscape standards. 
b.  Individual single family lots, within platted residential subdivisions, with less than two units per acre are required to plant four shade/canopy trees that are at least eight feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. Fifty percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard. All residential lots shall require that improvements be located so as to provide minimum disturbance to the natural topography of the site and protection to the maximum number of trees. 
c.  Where the proposed development area is so dense that the minimum site density factor can not reasonably be achieved, the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the minimum number of spaces required by zoning, placing additional planting islands within the development area, or reducing the area to be occupied by buildings. 
d.  In order to qualify for tree replacement density credit, all canopy/shade replacement trees shall be at least eight feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. All understory/flowering replacement trees shall be at least six feet tall planted and have a main trunk of not less than one and one-half caliper inches. Multi stemmed canopy trees shall count only the largest trunk for caliper. All multi-stemmed understory/flowering replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each with a minimum one-inch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet. All evergreen replacement trees shall be at least a seven-gallon size, six feet tall planted, and have a main trunk of not less than one and one-half caliper inches. All tree formed, multi-stemmed, evergreen replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each with a minimum one-inch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet and be pruned as tree form at time of planting. No more than 40 percent of any one genus may be included in any replanting plan. 
The minimum required quantity of trees on a site after development must produce a total site density factor (SDF) of 16 units per acre. The site density factor (SDF) is determined as follows: 
 SDF = (total site area, in acres) × 16 
Credit for existing trees proposed to be retained on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table 2-Credit for Existing Trees. Credit shall be given all trees retained on a property having a diameter of ten inches or more, except trees located in a required zoning buffer. Only 50 percent of tree credits may be calculated from areas located in the floodplain or delineated as wetlands. Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table 3-Credit for Replacement Trees. Credit shall be given all new trees replaced on the property except for new trees of less than one and one-half inches in diameter and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer. The number of new trees planted is determined as follows: 
Using Table 2-Credit for Existing Trees calculate the existing density factor (EDF) of trees three-inch diameter (DBH) or greater which will remain on the site and be protected during construction. 
Table 2-Credit for Existing Trees (EDF) Conversion from Tree Diameter in Inches to Tree Density Units for Tree Remaining on Site Diameter Units Diameter Units Diameter Units Diameter Units 3" 0.1 15" 1.2 27" 4.0 39" 8.3 4" 0.1 16" 1.4 28" 4.3 40" 8.7 5" 0.1 17" 1.6 29" 4.6 41" 9.2 6" 0.2 18" 1.8 30" 4.9 42" 9.6 7" 0.3 19" 2.0 31" 5.2 43" 10.1 8" 0.4 20" 2.2 32" 5.6 44" 10.6 9" 0.5 21" 2.4 33" 5.9 45" 11.0 10" 0.6 22" 2.6 34" 6.3 46" 11.5 11" 0.7 23" 2.9 35" 6.7 47" 12.0 12" 0.8 24" 3.1 36" 7.1 48" 12.6 13" 0.9 25" 3.4 37" 7.5 49" 13.1 14" 1.1 26" 3.7 38" 7.9 50" 13.6  
Note: Where there are not enough ten-inch DBH or greater existing trees, three-inch DBH or greater trees may be counted as table indicates (in lieu of planting new trees), provided they have grown in uncrowded conditions and have developed normal spread or they are part of a specimen tree stand. 
DBH = diameter at breast height (four and one-half feet above ground) 
To calculate the replacement density factor (RDF), subtract the existing density factor (EDF) from the site density factor (SDF). 
 RDF = SDF - EDF 
Example procedure for calculating the required replacement density factor (RDF): 
STEP 1 = Calculate the site density factor (SDF) by multiplying the number of site acres by 16. 
 Example = 1.85 acres × 16 = 29.60 units. 
STEP 2 = Calculate the existing density factor (EDF) of trees that will remain on site to be protected during construction. EDF is determined by converting the tree diameter (DBH) of individual existing trees to density factor units, using Table 2-Credit for Existing Trees. These units are then totaled to determine the EDF for the site. 
 Example = A total of 12 trees will remain on the 1.85 acre site in Step 1. The trees include: 
  3 - 12" pines 
  4 - 18" oak 
  3 - 20" pine 
  2 - 24" oak 
When converted to density factor units using Table 2, we arrive at the following values: 
DBH No. of Trees × Units Total 12" 3 × 0.8 2.4 18" 4 × 1.8 7.2 20" 3 × 2.2 6.6 24" 2 × 3.1 6.2  
Adding together the units of all remaining trees, the sum total of units = 22.40 Units. 
Since the existing density factor (EDF) is less than the required site density factor (SDF), then replacement trees are required. The minimum site density factor (SDF) for a 1.85 acre site, established in Step 1 has not yet been met. 
STEP 3 = Calculate the replacement density factor (RDF) by subtracting the existing density factor (EDF) (Step 2) from the site density factor (SDF) (Step 1). 
 RDF = EDF - SDF 
 Example: RDF = 29.60 (EDF) - 22.40 (SDF) 
29.60 - 22.40 = 7.20 (RDF) 
STEP 4 = The replacement density factor (RDF) can be converted back to caliper inches using Table 3-Credit for Replacement Trees. Any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the replacement density factor (RDF). 
  Example = On the 1.85 acre site the following number and size of trees will be planted as replacement trees: 
Number Size Species × Density Factor = Total Units 07 1.5" Dogwood x 0.4 = 2.80 06 2.0" Red Maple x 0.5 = 3.00 02 4.0" Red Oak x 0.7 = 1.40  
Adding together the units of proposed replacement trees, the sum total of units = 7.20 units. Proposed replacement units of 7.20 is equal to the replacement density factor (RDF) of 7.20 units, thus minimum replacement requirements have been met. 
Use Table 3-Credit for Replacement Trees to determine the number and size of trees that must be planted. Any combination of transplantable size trees can be used, so long as their total density factor units equal or exceed the RDF. Replacement trees must meet the minimum landscaping requirements set forth in section 10-85(2).

Important Note: For the purpose of this article, tree calipers are measured at one and one-half feet above the ground or at any point below that for new trees or multi trunked species, but in no case less than six inches from the ground. 
Existing trees proposed to be retained and new trees proposed to be planted in order to meet the buffer requirements of the Zoning Ordinance or conditions of zoning, special use or variance approval shall not be considered in fulfilling the requirements of this section concerning site tree density factors. Buffer requirements are considered to be in addition to the minimum site tree density requirements. See appropriate zoning district classification for any additional landscaping or buffering requirements. 
(6)  Specimen trees. Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. Trees unique due to age, size, species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them. It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. These trees are to be identified and highlighted on the tree protection plan. Design of buildings, hardscapes and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees. 
Tree density unit credits are given for existing trees that are saved during the site development process, with greater credits given to specimen trees. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved for such purpose would be two times the assigned unit value in Table 2-Credit for Existing Trees. 
The following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify: 
a.  Size criteria: 
1.  Large hardwoods (oaks, poplars, sweetgums, etc.): 24-inch diameter or larger. 
2.  Large softwoods (pines, deodar cedar, etc.): 30-inch diameter or larger. 
3.  Small trees (dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.): eight-inch diameter or larger. 
b.  Condition criteria: 
1.  Life expectancy of more than 15 years. 
2.  Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay. 
3.  No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). 
4.  No major insect or pathological problem. 
A lesser sized tree can be considered a specimen tree, if in the judgement of the city landscape architect: 
1.  It is a rare or unusual species or of historical significance. 
2.  It is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape. 
3.  It is a tree with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
(7)  Replacement of specimen trees. In the event any specimen tree should be removed during the land development process, the applicant shall be required to replace any specimen tree being removed with suitable replacement trees elsewhere on the site. Removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality. Tree replacement, in addition to the minimum required tree density, shall be required in recompense for the removal of specimen trees. Specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees, minimum three-inch caliper, with a inch for inch replacement of the specimen tree removed. To determine if the replacement is reasonable the city landscape architect shall consider intended use of: 
a.  Existing tree coverage, size, and type. 
b.  Number of trees to be removed on the entire property. 
c.  Number of trees to be saved on the entire property. 
d.  Area to be covered with structures, parking, and driveways. 
e.  Grading and drainage requirements. 
f.  Character of the site and its environs. 
Any tree, designated on the tree protection plan to be saved, which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the city landscape architect, shall be replaced with a tree or trees equal to the unit value of the tree damaged. However, any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equaling an inch for inch replacement of the tree damaged. 
In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 60 months following completion of development, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) having an inch for inch replacement of the specimen tree removed on the site as approved by the city landscape architect. 
Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city landscape architect must be replaced by trees equaling a two times an inch for inch replacement of the tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be three-inch minimum caliper. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city landscape architect. 
(8)  Relocation of trees. 
a.  Trees to be relocated shall be removed with a root ball sized in proportion to their calipers. Root balls shall be 12 inches in diameter for each one-inch of tree caliper. Trees four inches in caliper and smaller are to be measured six inches from the ground. Trees four inches to eight inches caliper are measured 12 inches from the ground, trees eight inches caliper or larger are measured from breast height. 
b.  Trees which are to be relocated in areas which do not require grading are to be placed directly into their new location. Trees to be relocated into the limit of work line shall have tree barriers placed around it in accordance with the plan. 
c.  Trees to be transplanted off site in full leaf shall be covered entirely with a protective cloth covering prior to transporting. Trees transplanted on site require no covering. 
d.  Trees which are to be relocated in areas to be graded are to be stockpiled. Stockpiled trees shall be well heeled in and protected from excessive wind and sun. The Contractor shall provide water to maintain a healthy condition. 
e.  Where a tree is to be removed under the provisions of this article, the city may, with consent of the property owner, relocate the tree at the city's expense to city-owned property for replanting, either for permanent utilization at the new location, or for future use at another city property. 
f.  Credit may be given to the property for each relocated tree as though the tree was proposed to remain on the property, if the tree is relocated to a site designated by the city at the owner/developer's expense. 
(9)  Removal of trees. There will be a fee for obtaining a tree removal permit based on the number of trees to be removed. However, the removal of trees other than specimen trees from an owner owned, single family lot are exempt from provisions of this article, provided that the removal does not reduce the required tree density of the lot below the minimum requirements. Homeowners who remove trees on their own residential property, without cost of a person or company engaged in removing the trees for a fee, shall not pay any fee until they remove more than five trees at a time within a single calendar year. If a contractor is employed to remove trees, a tree removal permit shall be required for removing trees, eight inches or larger in diameter. Tree removal conducted on property, regardless of zoning classification, by any person or company for a fee shall require a tree removal permit. If significant trees are removed from any property without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the tree removal fee calculated. All contractors for tree removal must be licensed, bonded, and insured. 
a.  Safety standards. The contractor shall be solely responsible for pedestrian and vehicular safety and control within the work site and shall provide the necessary warning devices, barricades, and ground personnel needed to give safety, protection, and warning within the area where tree removal or pruning is to occur. Blocking of public streets shall not be permitted unless prior arrangements have been made with the city and is coordinated with appropriate departments. Traffic control is the responsibility of the contractor and shall be accomplished in conformance with state, county and local highway construction codes. 
b.  Tree pruning. Pruning is to be performed by tree workers who, through related training and on the job experience, are familiar with the techniques and hazards of this work including trimming, maintenance, repairing or removal, and equipment used in such operations. The use of climbing spurs or irons is not approved in pruning operations on live trees. This type of work is a potentially hazardous occupation and is to be undertaken only by trained personnel or under the supervision of trained personnel, all of whom are covered with workers compensation, property damage, public liability, and completed operations insurance. 
c.  Tree removal. Trees shall be removed in accordance with accepted industry standards and procedures and in accordance with the following minimum requirements: Extreme care shall be taken so as to prevent limbs, branches and trunks from falling and creating damage to adjacent homes, driveways, sidewalks, trees, shrubs, streets and other property, both public and private. This type of work is a potentially hazardous occupation and is to be undertaken only by trained personnel or under the supervision of trained personnel, all of whom are covered with workers compensation, property damage, public liability, and completed operations insurance. 
d.  Cleanup. Debris and logs shall not be left on the public right-of-way overnight. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to remove and dispose of, in a proper and acceptable manner, all logs, brush and debris resulting from the tree removal operation unless otherwise directed by the city. No person shall be issued a tree removal permit unless said person agrees to remove all cut logs, brush, and debris from the premises. Removal of such debris shall be performed daily so as to not disrupt the work of other contractors on the site. Absolutely no burying on site is allowed. No burning on site is allowed without a permit issued by the City of Newnan Fire Department. 
e.  Trees on private property. It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property bordering on any street upon which property there may be trees, to prune such trees in such a manner that they will not obstruct or shade street lights, obstruct passage of pedestrians on sidewalks, obstruct vision of traffic signs, or obstruct views of any street intersection. Any trees that are diseased or insect infested shall be removed, sprayed, or treated in such a manner that they will not infect or damage nearby public vegetation or cause harm to the community or citizens therein. The city landscape architect may order trees on private land that causes obstructions, present insect or disease problems, or otherwise present a danger to public health or safety be pruned, removed, or treated. 
f.  Fees. Permits shall be obtained by any person or company engaged in the removal of trees for a fee. The city landscape architect will review the tree removal plans and inspect the project site when necessary prior to tree removal of any trees. If significant trees are removed from any property without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the tree removal fee calculated. Minimum site tree densities must be maintained at all times. Permit fees shall be as set forth in the fee schedule for the City of Newnan. 
g.  Penalties. Any person, firm, corporation, company, or partnership violating any provision of this article shall be punished as provided in section 1-14 of the Code of Ordinances. Where an offense continues from day to day, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate offense. The owner of a premises, where anything in violation of this article shall exist, or any person, firm, corporation, company, or partnership who may have assisted in the commission of such violation shall be guilty of a separate offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as herein provided. 
( Ord. No. 03-15, § 1, 6-26-03 ) 
Sec. 10-85. - Landscape plan. 
    A landscape plan prepared by a landscape architect, registered in the State of Georgia, will be required for any development, with the exception of the construction of individual single family and detached dwellings, in the City of Newnan. A landscape plan shall be prepared for any project wherein buffer areas or other landscaping areas or treatments are required by this article, the zoning ordinance, conditions of zoning, special use or variance approval, or other regulations of the City of Newnan, and shall be approved prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit. A landscape plan is required for single-family residential subdivision development plats. The plan shall address common areas including, but not limited to, such areas as parks, active and passive recreation areas, and entrances. These residential common areas shall maintain or exceed the minimum site density factor of 16 units per acre. 
    The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article, or some combination of the two. The site density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. Individual single family lots, within platted residential subdivisions, with less than two units per acre are required to plant four shade/canopy trees that are at least eight feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. Fifty percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard. Minimum tree site density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in this section. The trees, both retained and new, where feasible shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve results following professional landscape standards. 
    All areas not devoted to structures, site development features, and natural vegetation shall be landscaped. Landscaping shall include trees, shrubs, ground cover, perennials, annuals, plant sculpture, art and the use of building and paving materials in a manner that respects the natural topographic features and natural resources of the site. 
(1)  Landscape plan requirements: The landscape plan may be submitted as part of the tree protection plan, provided that all required information is legible, or as a separate drawing which includes, as a minimum, the following: 
a.  Name, address, and phone number of owner of record and applicant.

(2)  Landscaping requirements: The City of Newnan has devised a plant palette for the City of Newnan. This is a detailed plant list of trees, shrubs, and groundcovers which outline historically relevant and suitable plant material for the City of Newnan. By using this list, focusing primarily on those plants identified as signature plants, we hope to promote the continued development of a regional character, ensure the preservation of Newnan's horticultural heritage, and provide guidance in the decision making for our landscape design efforts. The plant palette is listed at the end of this article. 
a.  General requirements. 
1.  Unless otherwise approved by the city landscape architect, all plant material selected to meet the replanting and/or landscaping requirements shall be selected from the plant palette for the City of Newnan. Plant materials shall be placed appropriately for future growth. 
2.  All projects within the City of Newnan, with the exception of the construction of individual single family and detached dwellings, are required to maintain a minimum site density factor of 16 units per acre and to provide the minimum landscaping requirements. The minimum site density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article, or some combination of the two. 
3.  Individual single family lots, within platted residential subdivisions, with less than two units per acre are required to plant four shade/canopy trees that are at least eight feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. Fifty percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard. 
4.  The following minimum landscaping requirements, which can be used as replacement units to meet the required site density factor, with the minimum number and size of trees and shrubs, per acre are: 
2 large shade/canopy trees 4-inch caliper 6 large shade/canopy trees 3-inch caliper 10 large shade/canopy trees 2-inch caliper 15 small understory/flowering trees 1.5-inch caliper 40 evergreen shrubs 3-gallon size (18 inches) 15 deciduous shrubs 3-gallon size (18 inches)  
5.  Projects that are zoned industrial are required to provide the following maximum landscaping requirements, with no less than 60 percent of the required landscaping to be placed in the required front yard. The remaining 40 percent shall be evenly distributed throughout the site. For corner lots or lots with more than one street frontage, no less than 70 percent of required landscaping shall be placed in the yards adjacent to the rights of way of said streets. Buffers, screening requirements, and specimen tree replacements are considered to be in addition to these maximum landscape requirements. 
5 large shade/canopy trees 2-inch caliper 8 small understory/flowering trees 1.5-inch caliper 20 evergreen shrubs 2-gallon size (12 inches) 8 deciduous shrubs 2-gallon size (12 inches)

Multi stemmed canopy trees shall count only the largest trunk for caliper. All multi-stemmed understory/flowering replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each with a minimum one-inch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet. All evergreen replacement trees shall be at least a seven-gallon size, six feet tall planted, and have a main trunk of not less than one and one-half caliper inches. All tree formed, multi-stemmed, evergreen replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each with a minimum one-inch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet and be pruned as tree form at time of planting. 
7.  No more than 40 percent of any one tree species shall be permitted on a landscape and/or tree protection plan. Trees and shrubs shall be evenly distributed on site. 
8.  Landscaping shall not obstruct the view between 24 inches high and 60 inches high on access drives, streets or parking aisles. Indicate clear sight lines at intersections. 
9.  Where landscaping requirements are included as part of the regulations for any zoning district classification, the most restrictive requirement shall govern. See appropriate zoning district classification for any additional landscaping requirements. 
10.  The landscape plan must address all the landscaping requirements of this article, which includes, but is not limited to, site density factor, tree replacement, interior parking lot plantings, peripheral parking lot plantings, landscape strip plantings, landscape screening plantings, and landscape buffer plantings. 
b.  Interior parking lot planting requirements. If any parking lot contains 20 or more parking spaces, interior parking lot landscaping shall be required as follows: 
1.  There shall be a minimum curb radii of three feet required on the corners of all landscape islands and medians to allow for free movement of motor vehicles around planting materials. All islands and medians shall have raised curbs around them to protect parked vehicles, provide visibility, confine moving traffic to aisles and driveways, and provide space for landscaping. Striping of parking islands is not permitted. 
2.  All rows of parking spaces shall be provided a terminal island to protect parked vehicles, confine moving traffic to aisles and driveways, and provide space for landscaping. A terminal island for a single row of parking spaces shall be planted with a least one canopy/shade tree. A terminal island for a double row of parking spaces shall contain not less than two shade/canopy trees. 
3.  All landscape islands within parking lots shall be 100 percent landscaped with deciduous trees, evergreen shrubs (not to exceed three feet high at maturity), ground cover (which does not require mowing) and/or flowers in mulched beds. 
4.  Interior landscape islands shall be provided within parking areas of 20 or more spaces. Parking areas designated to accommodate more than 20 motor vehicles must install interior landscape islands so that no more than 16 adjacent parking spaces exist without a landscaped separation of at least eight feet in width. If significant tree save areas or natural areas exist within a parking area, the city landscape architect may make an exception to this requirement, as appropriate. 
5.  Each island or strip shall contain a minimum of 125 square feet. All landscape islands shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the parking lot, and shall have a minimum width of eight feet measured from back of curb. There shall be a minimum eight-foot wide (back of curb to back of curb) curbed landscape island at the end of every row of parking, equal in length to the adjoining parking space. A parking island must be located no further apart than every 16 parking spaces. 
6.  Landscaped areas between parking areas and buildings shall not be considered as interior landscaping. 
7.  Areas used principally for storage of vehicles or display areas do not require interior islands if such areas are screened from adjacent properties and public streets. 
c.  Peripheral parking lot planting requirements. If any parking lot contains ten or more parking spaces, peripheral parking lot landscaping shall be required as follows: 
1.  The perimeter of all parking areas shall be landscaped. 
2.  Except where otherwise stated in the City of Newnan's Zoning Ordinance, a landscaping strip ten feet in width measured from the back of curb, shall be located between the parking lot and the abutting property lines, except where driveways or other openings may necessitate other treatment. 
3.  Peripheral plantings shall include one shrub per 20 linear feet of abutting land and one of, or a combination of the following, which need not necessarily be installed on center: 
a)  One understory/flowering tree per 20 linear feet; One shade/canopy tree per 35 linear feet. 
4.  Trees shall be planted at a minimum of three feet from any curb, so as to prevent injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. Where landscaped areas are located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the striping between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. 
d.  Landscape planting strip requirements. Landscape strips shall be used to separate uses, provide vegetation in developed areas, and enhance the appearance of individual properties. The following minimum requirements shall apply to landscape planting strips: 
1.  The width of a landscape strip must be as a minimum, conform with the requirements of the conditions of zoning. Otherwise, the minimum width of landscape strips must conform with the requirements of the zoning ordinance or this article, whichever is greater. 
2.  Landscape plantings shall be provided in a landscape strip of at least ten feet in which adjacent to any street right of way abutting the property and running the length of the entire property frontage; and in areas adjacent or internal to off street parking lots that contain more than five parking spaces; and as required by a condition of zoning, special use or variance approval. 
3.  No permanent structures are permitted within landscape strips, with the exception of identification signage and lightposts. This includes pavement, retaining walls, curbing, dumpsters, drainage structures, detention facilities, rip-rap, utility boxes, vacuum/air/water, etc. The deposition of storm water runoff into or drainage swales through a landscape strip is not permitted. Graded slopes within a landscape strip may not be steeper than 4:1. 
4.  Curb stops must be used to prevent vehicle overhang into required landscape strips and parking islands. 
5.  Landscape strips shall contain one tree for each 35 linear feet of strip length. Each tree shall be at least eight feet planted. Clumping is permitted provided that adequate spacing is allowed for future growth there is no gap greater than 50 feet. 
6.  Landscape strips shall contain ten shrubs for each 35 linear feet of strip length. Clumping is permitted provided that adequate spacing is allowed for future growth and there is no gap greater than 50 feet. 
7.  The remaining ground area shall be sodded, seeded, or hydroseeded with grass, and/or planted with groundcover species. 
8.  Where landscaping areas adjoin grassed rights-of way, such areas shall be considered part of the landscaped area for purposes of maintenance. As of completion of site improvements, the property owner shall have an implied easement on rights-of-way extending from the site to the road pavement in order to complete the required maintenance. 
e.  Landscape screening planting requirements. Screening shall be used as a buffer between incompatible uses, and to reduce the effects of headlight glare, noise, and other objectionable activities. The following minimum requirements shall apply to screening: 
1.  Screening shall be installed on all lot lines where commercial, industrial, and institutional uses abut residential zoning districts except for entrances and exits. 
2.  Screening may consist of a fence, a wall, a berm, or vegetation and/or a mix of any or all of the foregoing. The outer or public side of fences and walls shall be landscaped enough to soften the structure with a tree or shrub group at least every 50 feet, subject to approval of the city landscape architect. Berms must be a minimum two feet high, two-foot minimum crown width, and side slopes of no greater than three to one. 
3.  Parking areas shall be adequately screened so as to not be visible from contiguous residential areas and shall have limited visibility from adjoining streets. 
4.  Dumpster and trash storage/collection areas shall be adequately screened so as not to be visible from streets and/or adjacent properties regardless of adjacent land use or zoning classification. 
5.  Loading areas shall be adequately screened so as not to be visible form any residential areas or streets. 
6.  Heating and cooling units for developments other than single family shall be adequately screened so as not to be visible from streets and/or adjoining streets. 
7.  All plantings used for screening shall consist of evergreen trees, shrubs, or combination thereof. All trees planted shall be a minimum five feet planted and shall be a species which will achieve a height of at least 20 feet at maturity. All shrubs planted shall be a large growing species, shall be a minimum of two feet planted, and shall be a species which will achieve a height of at least ten feet at maturity. 
8.  Plants shall be spaced so as to provide for effective visual screening within three growing seasons. Planting beds required for screening shall be a minimum of six feet in width. 
f.  Landscape buffer planting requirements. Buffers shall be required between uncomplimentary uses in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance or as a condition of zoning, special use or variance approval. Buffers are a landscaping requirement that is in addition to the minimum landscaping requirements of any site development in the City of Newnan. 
1.  Landscape buffers are intended to separate different land uses and zoning districts from each other and are intended to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas. There shall be five different buffers types based on acreage of the project and zoning districts. Each different buffer identifies the width of the buffer, minimum tree spacing standards, minimum shrub spacing standards, and minimum/maximum wall and/or fence standards. The buffers types are listed in the following matrix based on the zoning of the proposed project and the adjacent zoning also. Buffer widths for each buffer type will be based on project acreage. 
  Area 1 consists of those zoning districts where lots sizes are permitted to be smaller than 20,000 square feet; 
  Area 2 consists of those zoning districts where lots sizes are permitted to be 20,000 square feet or greater. 
Type A Buffer: Type B Buffer: Area 1 = 5 feet densely planted Area 1 = 10 feet densely planted Area 2 = 15 feet densely planted Area 2 = 25 feet densely planted Type C Buffer: Type D Buffer: Area 1 = 20 feet densely planted Area 1 = 25 feet densely planted Area 2 = 35 feet densely planted Area 2 = 50 feet densely planted Type E Buffer: Area 1 = 50 feet densely planted Area 2 = 100 feet densely planted

2.  Required undisturbed buffers must remain undisturbed and actively protected in perpetuity. Buffers must be replanted where sparsely vegetated or where disturbed for approved access and utility crossings. Existing vegetation shall be used to meet all or part of the requirements of this section whenever possible, if it provides the same level of obscurity as the planted buffer required below. Required buffer plantings allow for a mix of large canopy trees, small flowering/evergreen trees, and large shrubs. The mix is designed to create a buffer which will give a satisfactory screen within three to five years of planting, under normal maintenance, while allowing room for the various plants to grow. 
3.  Large canopy trees with a minimum height of eight feet planted and a minimum caliper of two inches shall be planted at the following rate: 
Required Buffer Width One Tree Per... Less than 20' 200 sq. ft. of buffer 21' to 30' 300 sq. ft. of buffer 31' to 50' 350 sq. ft. of buffer Greater than 50' 400 sq. ft. of buffer  
Small trees are required to fulfill from no less than 20 percent to no more than 30 percent of the required number of trees. Additionally, evergreen trees are required to fulfill at least 50 percent of the required trees planted in buffers greater than 30 feet. Evergreen and small flowering trees, the same required size as the large canopy trees, are to be planted at the same rate as the large trees. Two evergreen or small flowering trees for each required tree, with a minimum height of four feet planted, may be substituted. Trees shall be distributed along the entire length of the buffer. 
4.  Additionally evergreen shrubs, a minimum of 24 inches in height, of a variety that can be expected to reach four or five feet in height within three to five years of planting, shall be provided. Shrubs shall not normally be planted closer than six feet on center. Additionally, shrubs shall not normally be planted closer than six feet to planted trees, nor within the drip line of existing trees. Shrubs shall also be distributed along the entire length of the buffer. Evergreen shrubs shall be provided at the following rate: 
Required Buffer Width One Tree Per... Less than 20' 50 sq. ft. of buffer 21' to 30' 75 sq. ft. of buffer 31' to 50' 125 sq. ft. of buffer Greater than 50' 200 sq. ft. of buffer  
Variations in quantities and spacing of buffer shrubs may be approved by the city landscape architect when larger shrubs are provided. 
5.  The number of planting rows for supplemental plantings or replanting of shrubs is determined by the buffer width: 
Buffer Width Minimum Planting Rows Less than 10' 1 row 10' to 20' 2 rows 21' to 30' 3 rows 31' to 50' 4 rows Greater than 50' 4 rows plus 1 row for each additional 15 feet  
6.  Buffer planting requirements shall be guaranteed for the lifetime of the development. Necessary trimming and maintenance shall be performed to maintain the health of the plant materials, to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and to ensure that the buffer serves the purpose for which it is intended. 
(3)  Maintenance requirements. Two full growing seasons after the date of the initial inspection of new tree and landscape installations, the city landscape architect will again inspect all trees and landscaping on the project site. Any trees planted to meet the required tree site density factor which are dead or near death must be replaced. 
At the end of the two-year landscape establishment period, the city landscape architect shall re-inspect the site and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such finding, the bond shall be released. In absence of such finding, the bond shall not be released and the owner of the property shall be notified to replace the unhealthy trees and landscaping or take other appropriate action as approved by the city landscape architect. Upon failure of the owner to comply with the city landscape architect's decision regarding such trees, the city shall use the bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance. Final inspection shall be scheduled within ten working days' notice. 
Trees, which are used to meet the tree density requirements, shall be fully maintained for an additional five years after the date of final landscape establishment inspection. It is the responsibility of the property owner to water, fertilize, and treat trees in order to maintain tree health and vigor. The property owner shall, at all times, maintain the required tree density. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this article. Trees which have been used to meet the tree density requirements shall not be removed at any time without approval of the city landscape architect. Removal of such trees will result in replacement of like kind and size. 
It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property subject to this article to maintain said property in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. Property shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Planting beds shall be mulched to prevent weed growth and maintain soil moisture. Plant materials shall be pruned as required to maintain good health and character. Turf areas shall be mowed periodically. All roadways, curbs, and sidewalks shall be edged when necessary in order to prevent encroachment from adjacent grassed areas. 
(4)  Irrigation requirements. Irrigation is to be provided for landscaped areas fronting multi-family, commercial and industrial developments. Irrigation is also to be provided along all road frontage for these types of developments. Irrigation systems can be beneficial in efficiently adding water to the landscape. Landscaped areas shall be irrigated by the use of an automatic irrigation system with controllers. The water demand of lawn areas is significantly greater than the water demand of most trees, shrubbery, or ground cover areas. Wherever feasible, sprinkler head irrigating lawns or other head water demand landscape areas shall be circuited so that they are on a separate zone or zones for those irrigating trees, shrubbery or other reduced water requirement areas. Automatically controlled irrigation systems shall be operated by an irrigation controller that is capable of watering high water requirement areas on a different schedule from low water requirement areas. No significant overthrow shall be allowed onto non-pervious areas. Irrigation circuits shall apply water onto lawn areas on a different schedule than those irrigating the planting beds. Low trajectory heads or low volume water distributing devices shall be used. Irrigation controllers shall be capable of irrigating grass and tree-shrub zones on different schedules. 
5.  Penalties. Any person, firm, corporation, company, or partnership violating any provision of this article shall be punished as provided in section 1-14 of the Code of Ordinances. Where an offense continues from day to day, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate offense. Each tree cut, damaged, or poisoned shall constitute a separate offense. The owner of a premises, where anything in violation of this article shall exist, or any person, firm, corporation, company, or partnership who may have assisted in the commission of such violation shall be guilty of a separate offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as herein provided.

(Ord. No. 05-06, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-113. - Applicability. 
    This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 10-89 of this article. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. 
(1)  Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities: 
a.  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of this article. 
b.  Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements. 
c.  Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of this article. 
(2)  Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this article. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. 
a.  Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: 
1.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
2.  Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures; 
3.  Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property; 
4.  Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks; 
5.  Unpaved foot trails and paths; 
6.  Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used. 
b.  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically exempted above. 
c.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article. 
d.  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
e.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the (review and permitting authority) on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within 10 days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the (review and permitting authority) to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
f.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silviculture or agricultural uses and are riot incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
    After the effective date of this article, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 10-114(b) below. 
(Ord. No. 05-06, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-114. - Land development requirements. 
(a)  Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
(2)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
(3)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
(b)  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the engineering department finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the zoning board of appeals of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
(2)  Except as provided above, the zoning board of appeals of the city shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the zoning board of appeals. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
(3)  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this article would create an extreme hardship. 
(4)  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
(5)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(6)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
(Ord. No. 05-06, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-115. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
    This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
(Ord. No. 05-06, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-116. - Additional information requirements for development on buffer zone properties. 
    Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setbacks hereunder must include the following: 
(1)  A site plan showing: 
a.  The location of all streams on the property; 
b.  Limits of required stream buffers and setbacks on the property; 
c.  Buffer zone topography with contour lines at no greater than five (5)-foot contour intervals; 
d.  Delineation of forested and open areas in the buffer zone; and, 
e.  Detailed plans of all proposed land development in the buffer and of all proposed impervious cover within the setback; 
(2)  A description of all proposed land development within the buffer and setback; and 
(3)  Any other documentation that the engineering department may reasonably deem necessary for review of the application and to insure that the buffer zone ordinance is addressed in the approval process. 
    All buffer and setback areas must be recorded on the final plat of the property following plan approval. 
(Ord. No. 05-06, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-117. - Responsibility. 
    Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this article shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the city, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. 
(Ord. No. 05-06, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-118. - Inspection. 
    The engineering department may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the engineering department in making such inspections. The city shall have the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area. 
    No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out official duties. 
(Ord. No. 05-06, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-119. - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
    Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article or the requirements of an approved site plan or permit may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section. Any such action or inaction which is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. 
(1)  Notice of violation. If the engineering department determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an approved site plan or the provisions of this article, it shall issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by this article without having first secured the appropriate permit therefore, the notice of violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of the activity being conducted on the site.

ARTICLE VI. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

Sec. 10-141. - Introduction. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
(2)  These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
(3)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
(4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
(5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into municipal separate storm sewer systems; 
(6)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
    Therefore, the city adopts this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
(Ord. No. 05-05, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-142. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system by any person; 
(2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
(3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and, 
(4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the corporate area of the city. 
(c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(d)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
(e)  Responsibility for administration. The community development director, or his/her designee, shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 05-05, § I, 3-8-05) 
Sec. 10-143. - Definitions.

Sec. 10-149-10-160. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 10-161. - Introduction. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
(2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
(3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
(4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The state greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
(5)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
    Therefore, the city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
(Ord. No. 05-10, § I, 3-22-05) 
Sec. 10-162. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (c) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
(2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
(3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the city to be a hotspot land use; or, 
(4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (1) and (2;) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(c)  Exemptions. The following activities are exempt from this article: 
(1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
(2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
(3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
(4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the city engineer. 
(d)  Designation of article administrator. The city engineer or his/her designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
(e)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(f)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
(g)  Stormwater design manual. The city will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the state stormwater management manual and any relevant local addenda for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. The manual may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience.

The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the postdevelopment stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, as well as to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and potential ideas for stormwater management designs before the formal site design engineering is commenced. To accomplish this goal the following information should be included in the concept plan which should be submitted in advance of the meeting: 
(1)  Existing conditions and proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum: existing and proposed topography; perennial and intermittent streams; mapping of predominant soils from soil surveys (when available); boundaries of existing predominant vegetation and proposed limits of clearing and grading; and location of existing and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas and other impervious surfaces. 
(2)  A written or graphic inventory of the natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project. This description should include a discussion of soil conditions, forest cover, topography, wetlands, and other native vegetative areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of other natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water well setbacks, septic setbacks, etc.). Particular attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or constraints for development. 
(3)  A written or graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management system including: preliminary selection and location of proposed structural stormwater controls; location of existing and proposed conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm drains; flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits; relationship of site to upstream and downstream properties and drainages; and preliminary location of proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings.

(Ord. No. 05-10, § I, 3-22-05; Ord. No. 12-12, § I, 7-24-12; Ord. No. 12-21, § I, 10-9-12) 
Sec. 10-165. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
    The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
(1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the state stormwater management manual; 
b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to tie specific criteria in the state stormwater management manual; and, 
c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
(2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
b.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a man-made channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity. 
c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
(3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) above is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the state stormwater management manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the state stormwater management manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the state stormwater management manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
(6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (a) above. The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the state stormwater management manual. 
(7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and, 
c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
(8)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the state Safe Dams Act and rules for dam safety as applicable.

Sec. 10-166. - Construction inspections of post-development stormwater management system. 
(a)  Inspections to ensure plan compliance during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the staff of the city or conducted and certified by a professional engineer who has been approved by the city. Construction inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management plan for establishing compliance. All inspections shall be documented with written reports that contain the following information: 
(1)  The date and location of the inspection; 
(2)  Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan; 
(3)  Variations from the approved construction specifications; and 
(4)  Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan. 
If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. 
(b)  Final inspection and as-built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the city is required before the release of any performance securities can occur.

Sec. 10-167. - Ongoing inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities and practices. 
(a)  Long-term maintenance inspection of storm water facilities and practices. Stormwater management facilities and practices included in a stormwater management plan which are subject to an inspection and maintenance agreement must undergo ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of the agreement, the plan and this article. 
A stormwater management facility or practice shall be inspected on a periodic basis by the responsible person in accordance with the approved inspection and maintenance agreement. In the event that the stormwater management facility has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city shall notify the person responsible for carrying out the maintenance plan by registered or certified mail to the person specified in the inspection arid maintenance agreement. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the agreement and the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the city may correct the violation as provided in subsection (d) below. 
Inspection programs by the city may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management facilities; and evaluating the condition of stormwater management facilities and practices. 
(b)  Right-of-entry for inspection. The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall provide for the city to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
(c)  Records of maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall provide records of all maintenance and repairs to the city. 
(d)  Failure to maintain. If a responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the city, after 30 days written notice (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours notice shall be sufficient), may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance requirements by performing the necessary work to place the facility or practice in proper working condition. The city may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work which shall be a lien on the property, and may be placed on the ad valorem tax bill for such property and collected in the ordinary manner for such taxes. 
(Ord. No. 05-10, § I, 3-22-05) 
Sec. 10-168. - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
    Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article or the requirements of an approved stormwater management plan or permit, may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section.

(Ord. No. 05-10, § I, 3-22-05) 
Sec. 10-169. - Designated drainage basin policy. 
(a)  Stillwood Creek Watershed Drainage Policy. 
(1)  Introduction. The City of Newnan (city) has completed a drainage study of the area surrounding an unnamed stream flowing from areas west of Interstate 85 generally easterly under Stillwood Drive, Fairway Drive and Horizon Hill. This stream for the purposes of this policy is hereafter referred to Stillwood Creek. The study was conducted by the city due to drainage complaints upstream of Stillwood Drive and in anticipation of upstream future developments. Based on the analysis of the watershed, a number of properties within the area have been shown to be at potential risk of flooding from large storm events. 
In order to ensure that future developments do not further exacerbate the potential for flooding of downstream properties, the city hereby adopts the following requirements for this basin. These requirements shall only apply to those lands that drain to the roadway culverts under Horizon Hill approximately 440 feet southwest of the intersection of Horizon Hill and Eagle Court, hereinafter the Stillwood Creek Watershed Drainage basin. These requirements shall not apply to those properties within the watershed that would not normally be required to develop stormwater management measures as outlined in the City's Post Construction Stormwater Management Ordinance. 
The purpose of this policy is to supplement the City's Post Construction Stormwater Management Ordinance (Chapter 10, Article VII of the Newnan Code of Ordinances). Where a conflict arises between the requirements in this policy and the requirements of the aforementioned ordinance, the stricter requirements shall apply. 
(2)  Pre-design recommendations. The following outlines the process for developing a stormwater management plan as required for issuance and maintenance of a site development permit in Newnan, Georgia within the Stillwood Creek Watershed drainage area. 
Pre-Design Phase 
Step 1. Prepare concept site plan. 
Step 2. Prepare a downstream analysis between the proposed development and the discharge of Stillwood Creek at Horizon Hill. 
Step 3. Submit a site plan, downstream analysis and supporting calculations to the city. 
Step 4. Meet with the city for a pre-design consultation if necessary. 
Design Phase 
Step 5. Prepare stormwater management plan. 
Step 6. Submit stormwater management plan to city for approval. 
Construction Phase 
Step 7. After receiving all approvals from the city begin construction. 
Step 8. Coordinate construction with city inspection staff during construction. 
Post-Construction Phase 
Step 9. After construction prepare as-built survey and as-built design certification. 
Step 10. Adjust stormwater structures if necessary. 
Step 11. Execute stormwater inspection and maintenance agreement for all private on-site stormwater management facilities. 
Step 12. Secure certificate of occupancy/final plat. 
(3)  Downstream analysis. Stormwater runoff discharges for the 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year 24-hour storm events must be analyzed at a minimum at the following analysis points. 
  All points where stormwater runoff will cross the property line of the development. 
  Downstream confluences of ditches, streams, and other conveyances. 
  Downstream public and private road crossings. 
This analysis must extend from the proposed development project site to a point immediately downstream of Horizon Hill. Please note that in some cases, this requirement will exceed the ten percent rule as outlined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. The downstream analysis shall consist of both existing conditions (at the time of application for a land disturbance permit) and proposed conditions (existing conditions updated to reflect the proposed development) and compare the discharges to illustrate the impacts from the proposed development. 
(4)  Water quality protection. All requirements as outlined in the Post Development Stormwater Management ordinance apply to development projects within the Stillwood Creek watershed. 
(5)  Downstream channel protection. All requirements as outlined in the Post Development Stormwater Management ordinance apply to development projects within the Stillwood Creek watershed. 
(6)  Flood protection. Given that the city has identified potential flooding issues along Stillwood Creek, the City shall require that all developments provide flood protection from increases in the 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year 24-hour storm events. Discharges must be analyzed at a minimum at the following analysis points. 
  All points where stormwater runoff will cross the property line of the development. 
  Downstream confluences of ditches, streams, and other conveyances. 
  Downstream public and private road crossings. 
No increases in discharges at these points from any storm event outlined above will be permitted under this policy. The only exception to this standard will consist of the acquisition of a flood easement from all downstream properties (up to and immediately downstream of Horizon Hill) affected by any proposed increases in stormwater runoff. The city shall have the authority to approve or disapprove such a measure regardless of the acquisition of such easements.

(a)  (1)  The purpose of this policy is to supplement and define the rights and responsibilities of the city and property owners in the operation, maintenance, and repair of physical stormwater assets/infrastructure. This policy will additionally define the rights and responsibilities for the private property owner(s) for maintaining the water quantity and quality functions of stormwater best management practices (BMP's), as well as provide for city guidance to ensure their proper functioning. 
(2)  Reference is made to section 10-161 through section 10-169 of Article VII, of Chapter 10, Environment; Post Development Stormwater Management, of the Code of Ordnances for the City of Newnan as set out in this Article VII; and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD) and the Georgia Environmental Protection Division's (EPD) Phase II National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit. 
(b)  A stormwater management system is the entire set of structural and non-structural stormwater management facilities (manmade structures or natural watercourses) and practices that are used to collect, convey, store, treat, and dispose of storm, flood or surface drainage waters in a manner intended to prevent increased flood damage, streambank channel erosion, habitat degradation, water quality degradation, and to enhance and promote public health, safety, and general welfare. These structural and non-structural stormwater facilities may include detention areas, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, gulches, streams, gullies, flumes, culverts, gutters, inlets, pipes, ditches, catch basins, junction boxes, headwalls, weirs, water quality devices, and outlet control devices. 
(c)  Private stormwater management facilities are privately owned and it shall be the responsibility of the owner(s) to ensure proper maintenance and function of the stormwater management facilities located on their private property. This shall be accomplished through periodic inspections and routine maintenance by the responsible party. There shall be a perpetual, non-exclusive easement that allows access for inspection and emergency maintenance activities. 
(d)  It shall be the responsibility of the city for inspecting and maintaining stormwater management facilities located on municipal property and within the public right-of-way (ROW). This includes stormwater structural controls on properties owned by the city and in the public ROW, and some pipes draining public streets. Pipes draining public streets are maintained in the upstream direction to the nearest stormwater structural control, typically a junction box or headwall, from the public ROW. In the upstream direction, drainage infrastructure beyond the nearest stormwater structural control to the public ROW shall be privately maintained. In the downstream direction, pipes draining public streets are maintained to the downstream headwall or outfall. For drainage infrastructure on private property, beyond the ROW, draining a public street, a recorded easement, accepted by the city, shall convey a right to discharge stormwater and a responsibility for maintenance and repair to the city. Where a public drainage responsibility exists to a downstream headwall or outfall, the city may maintain the area just downstream of the headwall or outfall for an additional ten feet to ensure the unobstructed, free flow of stormwater, and to prevent erosion around the headwall or outfall. 
(e)  Where a permanent maintenance agreement exists between the city and a private property owner, the stated responsibilities in the permanent maintenance agreement shall take precedent to the extent of service policy. This does not apply for maintenance agreements between parties that do not include the city. 
(f)  For subdivisions with an established homeowners association (HOA), the HOA shall be the responsible party for any structural stormwater controls on private property, including detention ponds, retention ponds, underground stormwater storage facilities, and water quality units. 
(g)  For subdivisions without an established HOA, the owner(s) of the property on which any structural stormwater controls are located shall be responsible for said structural stormwater controls, including detention ponds, retention ponds, underground stormwater storage facilities, and water quality units. 
(h)  For commercial and industrial developments, the owner(s) of the property on which any structural stormwater controls are located shall be responsible for said structural stormwater controls, including detention ponds, retention ponds, underground stormwater storage facilities, and water quality units. 
(i)  The maintenance and repair of driveway aprons and pipes associated with driveway aprons shall be the responsibility of the property owner(s). 
(j)  The maintenance of normal unobstructed flow in open channels, including ditches, swales, streams and creeks, shall be the responsibility of the property owner(s). 
(k)  A responsible party shall keep documentation of all inspections and maintenance activities for structural stormwater controls and provide said documentation to the city upon request. The city, in accordance with the city's NPDES permit and stormwater management plan, will conduct routine inspections, random inspections, requested inspections, complaint-based inspections, and interjurisdictional inspections for evaluation of the existing conditions of structural stormwater controls and may include sampling of discharges. 
(l)  The city may conduct emergency maintenance or repairs if a responsible party fails or refuses to maintain or repair structural stormwater controls located on private property, in proper working order, following the issuance of a notice of violation, in accordance with city ordinance. The city may assess the property owner(s) for the cost of the maintenance activity or repair work. Non-payment of such costs shall constitute a lien against the property owner(s) and may be levied and collected in the same manner as ad valorem taxes. 
(m)  A permit shall be required for extending a storm pipe by a private property owner, on private property, upstream or downstream from and connecting to a public storm pipe draining the public ROW. The extension shall be designed and stamped by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. A permanent easement shall be accepted by the city, and recorded, permitting the discharge of storm water in the extended storm pipe and to allow for maintenance and repair of the extended storm pipe.

ARTICLE VIII. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT AND FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

Sec. 10-181. - Introduction. 
(a)  The mayor and city council have determined that the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extra ordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  The mayor and city council have determined that flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
(c)  The mayor and city council has determined that effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize damage to private property; 
(3)  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
(4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(d)  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and city council do ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

The market value of the building means: 
(1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or 
(2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully complaint with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(2)  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under (1) above shall also meet the following conditions: 
a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of section 10-185(d); 
e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the city building official or his designee using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
(d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposals to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 10-186(d) apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city building official or his designee prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the city building official or his designee. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
(4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
(e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below. 
(2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
(3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city building official or his designee until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the city building official or his designee. 
(f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The city building official or his designee may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the city building department.

Sec. 10-187. - Variance procedures. 
    The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the city building official or his designee, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
(1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the city building official or his designee. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city building official or his designee. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city building official or his designee shall have the right to appeal such decision to the board of zoning appeals as established by the city in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the board of zoning appeals. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning appeals may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1 et seq. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the city building official or his designee and city board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
d.  The building official or his designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city building official or his designee and city board of zoning appeals shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city building official or his designee and the city board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article. 
(11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

# of seats: The total seating capacity of the restaurant gallons of water/meal: estimated # of gallons of water used per meal served. 
5 if full service restaurant 
2 if take out restaurant only 
Hours/2: # of hours restaurant is open for business divided by 2. 
Loading factor: 
1.25: Interstate highway 
1.0: Freeways and recreational areas 
0.8: Main highway 
0.5: Other roads/streets 
c.  Inspection, pumping and maintenance. Newnan Utilities shall be responsible for pumping, cleaning, and inspection of all grease interceptors. The food service facility will be responsible for installation and repairs of grease interceptors. Pumping services shall include the initial complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom sludges and solids from the interceptor. 
Waste haulers must have written permission from Newnan Utilities, in order to return any gray water back into the grease interceptor. This permission will be granted on a case by case basis and will depend upon the methods by which the solids and grease are separated in order to assure that clear water is the only material returned to the grease interceptor. 
d.  Interceptor pumping frequency. Each facilities' grease interceptor will be pumped at least once every 12 weeks. Newnan Utilities also has the right to pump a facilities' grease interceptor more frequently pumping if Newnan Utilities determines it to be necessary or prudent. 
e.  Variance procedure. If a food service facility determines that pumping once every 12 weeks is excessive then the facility may make written application for a variance from the above described pumping schedule. 
1.  The food service facility will submit an application on a form provided by Newnan Utilities. 
2.  The food service facility will also be required to pay a variance fee of $300.00 plus any sampling done by Newnan Utilities. 
3.  At the time which the grease interceptor is due to be pumped a representative of Newnan Utilities will collect a sample from the discharge point of the grease interceptor. After the sample is collected it will be analyzed for fats, oils, and grease content by a laboratory chosen by Newnan Utilities. 
4.  For the variance to be considered, the sample must show a fats, oils, and grease content of less than 100 mg/l. If the sample does show a level below this then a sample will be taken once a week until the sample exceeds the 100 mg/l mark established. Thus the time elapsed between the last pumping and the time at which the sample exceeds the above mentioned mark will then be the frequency at which that particular trap is pumped. 
5.  If at any time the food service facility changes ownership or does any type of renovation the schedule will revert to the original schedule established by Newnan Utilities. 
6.  If the initial sample taken from a grease interceptor is not below the 100 mg/l mark then the variance will not be considered. 
f.  Inspection. Grease interceptors shall be inspected by a GMP official as necessary. 
g.  Repairs. Each food service facility shall be responsible for the cost and scheduling of all repairs to its grease interceptor(s). Repairs required by a GMP official shall be corrected within 30 calendar days after the date a written notice requiring the repairs is received by the facility or unless notice from Newnan Utilities establishes a different compliance date. 
h.  Disposal. Wastes removed from each grease interceptor shall be disposed of at a facility permitted by the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Chapter of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources to receive such wastes or at a location designated by Newnan Utilities for such purposes. Neither grease or solid materials removed from interceptors shall be returned to any grease interceptor, private sewer line or to any portion of Newnan Utilities wastewater collection system or water reclamation facilities without prior written permission GMP official. 
i.  Interceptor additives. Any chemicals, enzymes, emulsifiers, live bacteria or other grease cutters or additives are not permitted by Newnan Utilities unless authorized by a GMP official. MSDS sheets and any other applicable information concerning the composition, frequency of use and mode of action of the proposed additive shall be sent to the city together with a written statement outlining the proposed use of the additive(s). Based upon the information received and any other information solicited from the potential user or supplier, the city shall permit or deny the use of the additive in writing. Permission to use any specific additive may be withdrawn by the city at any time. 
j.  Alternative grease removal devices or technologies. Alternative devices and technologies such as automatic grease removal systems shall be subject to written approval by a GMP official prior to installation. Approval of the device shall be based on demonstrated (proven) removal efficiencies and reliability of operation. The city may approve these types of devices depending on manufacturer's specifications on a case by case basis.

(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) below, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this division. 
(2)  If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his predecessor in title or interest) for system improvements to public facilities as defined herein, prior to the effective date of this division, for which impact fees would otherwise be imposed, is greater than the impact fee which would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding.

(2)  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer of his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the City of Newnan, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the City of Newnan, would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
(3)  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his predecessor in title or interest accepted by the City of Newnan, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, for which present value may be calculated. 
(4)  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned to the State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.

All buildings and structures erected hereafter, all uses of land, water or buildings
established hereafter, any occupation of a building, structure or land hereafter, all
structural alterations or relocations of existing buildings occurring hereafter, and
all enlargements of, additions to, changes in, and relocations of existing uses
occurring hereafter shall be subject to the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance.
Existing buildings, structures, and uses which comply with the regulations of this
Ordinance shall likewise be subject to all regulations of this Ordinance.
Existing buildings, structures, and uses which do not comply with the regulations
of this Ordinance shall be permitted to continue subject to the provisions of Sec.
1-7, Nonconformities.
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
1-8
(b) General Prohibition.
Any building or structure, any use of any building, structure, or land; and any lot of
record which does not now or hereafter exist on the effective date of this
Ordinance shall be prohibited from being created, established, altered, moved,
diminished, divided, eliminated, or maintained in any manner except in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
No use or sale of land or buildings shall be allowed except in conformance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
(a) Purpose and Scope.
The purpose of this Section is to regulate and limit the development and
continued existence of uses, structures, signs, and lots established prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance which do not conform to the requirements of this
Ordinance. Many nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this Section
are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring
about their eventual improvement to a conforming status or elimination in order
to preserve the integrity of this Ordinance and the character of the City.
This Section shall not apply, however, to any feature which is the subject of a
variance or modification from particular regulations that has been granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA), Planning Commission, or City Council. Where a
variance or modification has been granted for a feature which does not otherwise
conform to the requirements of this Ordinance, that feature shall be deemed
conforming.
(b) Nonconforming Development; In General.
Lawfully nonconforming uses, structures, buildings, lots, and signs are declared by
this Zoning Ordinance to be incompatible with land uses, structures, buildings,
lots, and signs that conform to the zoning districts in which the nonconformity
exists. However, such nonconforming development may continue under the
circumstances presented in this Section for each type of nonconformity.
For the purpose of this Section, value shall be computed from the amount a
building or structure, as applicable, is appraised for tax purposes by Coweta
County.
(c) Nonconforming Uses.
Nonconforming Uses; Defined.
A nonconforming use is a use or activity that was lawfully established prior to the
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but which, by reason of such
adoption or amendment, is no longer a use or activity allowed by right or no
longer meets or conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
1-9
Continuation of Nonconforming Uses.
a. To avoid undue hardship, the lawful but nonconforming use of any structure
or land at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance may
be continued even though the use does not conform to the provisions of this
Ordinance, except that the nonconforming use shall not be:
1. Expanded or extended beyond the floor area or lot area that it occupied
on the effective date of this Ordinance except in those cases approved
pursuant to Subsection (g) of this Sec. 1.7.
2. Changed to another nonconforming use.
3. Reestablished after discontinuance for 6 consecutive months or more,
regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon or to resume
such use. This restriction shall not apply, however, to nonconforming
single-family dwellings located in any established historic preservation
district. If a nonconforming use of property is discontinued, but
re-established within 6 months, then the nonconforming use may
continue, provided that the nature and degree of the nonconformity
will not be changed or increased from that which existed before the
nonconforming use was discontinued.
b. A building occupied by a nonconforming use or a structure containing a
nonconforming use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Ordinance, or because of changes in the use of adjoining properties, may be
retained under the following circumstances:
1. It shall not be enlarged or altered except in conformance with this
Zoning Ordinance. It may be repaired to the extent necessary to
maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural
soundness or interior appearance or to remedy unsafe conditions which
cause a threat to public health or safety.
2. If it is destroyed by any means to an extent greater than 50% of its value
at the time of destruction, then such structure shall not be rebuilt or
such use shall not be reestablished in any way which does not conform
to the requirements of this Ordinance.
c. If any existing use was lawfully established in a zoning district that is
subsequently amended to require special exception approval for such use,
the existing use shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section.
d. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue
after such principal use shall cease or terminate.
(d) Nonconforming Structures.
Nonconforming Structure; Defined.
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
1-10
A nonconforming structure is a structure or building whose size, dimensions,
location on a property or other features which were lawful prior to the adoption
or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but which, by reason of such adoption or
amendment, no longer meets or conforms to one or more such requirements of
this Ordinance.
Continuation of Nonconforming Structures.
a. A nonconforming structure may continue to be occupied and used, except
that it shall not be:
1. Enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, except as
provided in Subsection (g) of this Sec. 1.7 but it may be repaired to the
extent necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or
deterioration to the structural soundness or interior appearance; or to
remedy conditions which cause a threat to public health or safety or
that are required to bring the structure up to standards of the American
with Disabilities Act (ADA).
2. Moved in whole or in part to any other location unless every portion of
such structure and the use thereof is made to conform with all
requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable City ordinances.
b. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means and to an extent
greater than 50% of its value at the time of destruction, then such structure
shall not be restored, nor any use of the structure be re-established, in any
way which does not conform to the requirements of this Ordinance.
c. Any structure which existed on the date of adoption of this Ordinance which
is nonconforming solely due to a setback or yard requirements imposed by
this Ordinance and not existing as a part of previous ordinances, or as a part
of any other lawfully adopted ordinance, may be enlarged, increased,
extended, repaired or replaced so long as any such improvements do not
result in an increase in the degree of nonconformity.
d. See also the Restrictions on Particular Uses Article for additional
requirements pertaining to Telecommunications Facilities.
(e) Nonconforming Lots.
Nonconforming Lots; Defined.
A nonconforming lot is a lot of record whose area, frontage, width or other
dimensions, or location were lawful prior to the adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Ordinance, and which, by reason or such adoption or amendment, no
longer meets or exceeds one or more such requirements of the applicable zoning
district.
Treatment of Nonconforming Lots.
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
1-11
Any lot of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Ordinance may be used subject to the following exceptions and modifications:
a. Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance or the
owners successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable the
owner or successor to conform to the dimensional requirements of this
Ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family
residence in the RS-20, RS-15, or RU-7 districts or for an allowed use in all
other districts except PDR, PDC, PDO, PDI, MXD, OSD-1, or OSD-2. This shall
be subject to the building conforming to the dimensional requirements which
can be reasonably applied to the lot and that a variance from those which it
cannot reasonably conform to be granted by the BZA, and that construction
is in compliance with other City ordinances.
b. If two or more adjacent and vacant nonconforming lots are in single
ownership, and such lots individually have less frontage or area than the
minimum requirements of the district in which such lots are located, then
such lots shall be considered and treated as a single lot or several lots which
meet the minimum requirements of this Ordinance for the district in which
such lots are located.
c. If two or more adjoining and vacant lots with continuous frontage are in
single ownership, and such lots individually are less than the lot width
requirements for the district in which they are located, such groups of lots
shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted size
and the lot or lots in one ownership shall be subject to the dimensional
requirements of this Ordinance.
d. Wherever the line of demarcation between two zoning districts of different
usage divides a lot so that either one or both sections are made too small to
meet the requirements of this Ordinance, the property owner has the
privilege of using said lot for any allowed use of either of the two adjacent
districts provided the specific use and site plan is approved by the BZA. If,
however, one of the two uses is equal to or greater than 75% of the area of
the lot, that use shall be required.
e. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (3) below, boundary line
adjustments may be allowed between nonconforming lots provided the
Zoning Administrator finds that the degree of nonconformity is not increased
due to such adjustment.
f. Any lot, which by reason of realignment of a Federal or State highway or by
reason of condemnation proceedings, has been reduced in size to an area
less than that required by law, shall be considered a nonconforming lot of
record subject to the provisions set forth in this section; and any lawful use
or structure existing at the time of such highway realignment or
condemnation proceedings which would thereafter no longer be allowed
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
1-12
under the terms of this Ordinance shall be considered a nonconforming use
or structure as that term is used in this Ordinance.
Establishment of Nonconforming Lot Prohibited.
A lot may only be established after the effective date of this Ordinance if such lot
conforms to all applicable requirements of this Ordinance.
(f) Nonconforming Signs.
Nonconforming Signs; Defined.
A nonconforming sign is a sign that was lawfully erected and maintained prior to
the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, and which by reason of
such adoption or amendment fails to conform to all applicable regulations and
restrictions of this Ordinance.
Continuation of Nonconforming Signs.
Signs which, on the date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance,
were approved and legally erected under previous sign restrictions, and which
became or have become nonconforming with respect to the requirements of this
newly adopted or amended Zoning Ordinance, may continue in existence subject
to the following restrictions:
Burdon of Proof:
1. Signs for which documentation exists showing that the sign was erected
in conformance with the citys requirements and regulations are
considered legal nonconforming signs.
2. The burden of proof that an existing sign qualifies as a legal
nonconforming sign lies with the owner of the sign. Lacking such proof,
the sign may be determined to be an illegal nonconforming sign and its
removal required.
b. In all use districts, legal nonconforming signs may continue in existence
provided that the size of the sign face, body or structure is not increased.
c. A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced, enlarged or structurally altered
except to conform to the provisions of the Sign Regulations Article.
d. An existing sign that was legally erected and that becomes
nonconforming as to the setback requirements of the city due to road
widening may be moved to meet the setback requirements of this
Ordinance. Such sign shall not be increased in size or changed in any
manner except as to become conforming.
e. All nonconforming banners, pennants, and portable signs in existence as of
the date of adoption or subsequent amendment of this Zoning Ordinance
shall be removed within 12 months of such adoption or amendment.
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
1-13
f. When a nonconforming sign is demolished or damaged to the extent that
more than 50% of its surface area requires replacement, the sign shall be
removed or made to conform to the applicable requirements of this
Ordinance.
g. When the repair, maintenance, or replacement cost of a nonconforming sign
exceeds 50% of the value of such sign, the sign shall be removed or made to
conform to the applicable requirements of this Ordinance.
A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign,
except that:
a. The substitution or interchanging of poster panels, painted boards or
demountable material on nonconforming signs shall be allowed; and
b. A nonconforming sign may be altered to reduce its degree of nonconformity
to another type of nonconforming sign where the owner of an existing
nonconforming sign seeks to upgrade the sign to utilize newer technology
and/or new materials in the sign structure as subject to the following
standards:
1. Any nonconformity concerning height is decreased by at least 50% by
the proposed improvement.
2. Any nonconformity concerning size of sign face is decreased by 50% of
the proposed improvement.
3. Any change-out of materials or technology conforms to the applicable
requirements of the Sign Regulations Article.
4. To the extent that the owner of the nonconforming sign owns more
than one nonconforming sign on the parcel or lot, improvement of one
nonconforming sign will be contingent upon the removal of any
additional nonconforming signs on the parcel or lot.
c. Where changed conditions beyond the control of the owner render the sign
nonconforming or warrant the signs repair.
(g) Expansion, Alteration, or Major Repair of Nonconformities.
Intent.
a. The intent of this subsection is to allow the continuation of any
nonconformity and the normal maintenance and repair thereof, but to
require any expansion, alteration, or major repair of a nonconformity to
obtain a special exception to determine whether it will substantially injure
the value, use, and enjoyment of neighboring properties.
b. For the purpose of this Subsection, normal maintenance and repair shall
mean:
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
1-14
1. Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or
deterioration to the structural soundness of interior appearance of a
building or structure without expanding or altering the building or
structure;
2. Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and
promote the safety of surrounding land uses;
3. Repairs which are required to remedy unsafe conditions which cause a
threat to public safety; and
4. Repairs which are required to bring a structure up to the standards of
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
Special Exception Procedure.
a. Unless this Section expressly provides otherwise, the expansion, alteration,
or major repair of any nonconformity shall require a special exception and
shall occur only as approved by the BZA in accordance with the procedures
and standards set forth in the Procedures and Permits Article.
b. In considering a special exception application, the BZA shall include in its
analysis the following factors in addition to the standards outlined in the
Procedures and Permits Article:
1. The possible detriment or benefit to the owner of the nonconformity
resulting from denying the approval, from approving the request but
requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into
compliance, or from approving the request;
2. The possible detriment or benefit to the owners of nearby properties
resulting from denying the approval, from approving the request but
requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into
compliance, or from approving the request; and
3. The possible detriment or benefit to the general public resulting from
denying the approval, from approving the request but requiring that the
nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or from
approving the request.
c. The BZA may impose any conditions on approval in accordance with the
Procedures and Permits Article.
d. If the BZA permits a nonconforming use to expand, then the area of such
expansion shall not exceed 25% percent of the area of the existing
nonconforming use.
e. In acting upon a special exception application, the BZA shall not order the
discontinuation or termination of a nonconformity. If an application is
denied, then the continuation, maintenance, and minor repair of the
Sec. 1-7. - Nonconformities.
1-15
nonconformity shall still be allowed in accordance with the terms of this
Article.

2-6
Sec. 2-8. - Interpretation of Zoning District Boundaries.
In interpreting the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
(a) The district boundaries are the center lines of either streets, roads, highways, or alleys
unless otherwise shown, and where the district designated on the Official Zoning Map is
bounded approximately by a street, road, highway, or alley, the center line of such street,
road, highway, or alley shall be construed to the boundary of the district.
(b) Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated, and where the property has
been or may hereafter be divided into platted blocks and lots, the district boundaries
shall be construed to be the platted lot lines, and where the district designated on the
Official Zoning Map is bounded approximately by platted lot lines, the platted lot lines
shall be the boundary of the district.
(c) Boundaries indicated as following the city limit line shall be construed as to follow such
limit line.
(d) Boundaries indicated as following the shorelines of bodies of water shall be construed to
follow such shorelines. Boundaries indicated as following the center lines of creeks,
streams, rivers, or other predominantly linear bodies of water shall be construed to
follow such center lines.
(e) In unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the Official Zoning Map shall be
determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.
(f) Boundaries indicated as parallel to or concentric with, or are extensions to features
indicated in the paragraphs above shall be so construed. Distances and dimensions not
specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined from the Official
Zoning Map by the Zoning Administrator and so noted on the map.
Sec. 2-9. - Zoning District Boundary Uncertainty.
(a) Where areas appear to be unclassified on the Official Zoning Map and classification
cannot be determined by the provisions of this Ordinance, such areas shall be considered
to be classified as RS-20 until action is taken to amend the Official Zoning Map.
(b) Where an area is in dispute, such areas shall be considered to be classified as RS-20 until
action is taken to make a valid determination.
(c) Where territory is added to the jurisdictional area through natural processes or any other
procedure (except annexation which shall be governed by the provisions of the
Procedures and Permits Article), such area shall be considered to be zoned RS-20 until
action is taken to amend the Official Zoning Map.
(d) Where natural or man-made features actually existing on the ground are not consistent
with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, the Planning and Zoning Director shall
interpret the district boundaries as so noted on the map.
Sec. 2-10. - Zoning and Development within Rights-of-Way.
2-7
(e) Where uncertainties continue to exist and/or further interpretation is required beyond
that presented in the paragraphs above, the question shall be presented to the Planning
and Zoning Director for interpretation.
Sec. 2-10. - Zoning and Development within Rights-of-Way.
(a) Zoning of Public Rights-of-Way.
(1) Normally, all publicly owned rights-of-way for roads, streets, alleys, easements, or
other public purposes are classified in the least intense of adjacent zones. In order
to define clearly the location of rights-of-way, the Official Zoning Map will not depict
the zoning within existing rights-of-way.
(2) When the Future Land Use Map recommends a land use category in conflict with
that specified in Subsection (1) above, the City Council may reclassify such right-ofway
to a zoning consistent with the land use category specified on the Future Land
Use Map.
(b) Rezoning of Proposed Rights-of-Way Where Zoning was Previously Withheld.
Where, by action of the City Council in prior rezonings, private property was withheld
from rezoning in order to provide for future construction, widening, realignment, and/or
relocation of existing or proposed public roads, streets, alleys, easements, or other public
facilities, the zoning of such private properties shall assume the zoning classification of
the land of which they are a part; or, the least intense adjacent zones if the land is not
part of an adjacent parcel.
(c) Air Rights and Subsurface Development within Public Rights-of-Way.
Air rights development and subsurface rights development are permitted in publicly
owned rights-of-way of existing or proposed public roads, streets, alleys, easements, or
other public facilities if the development will not conflict with the recommendations and
guidelines of the Comprehensive Plan nor any provisions of this or any other City code
or ordinance governing air rights or subsurface development.
Sec. 2-11. - Special Conditions of Previous Zoning Approvals Retained.
All special conditions and special stipulations imposed as conditions of zoning approval
of property prior to adoption of the Official Zoning Map are hereby retained and reaffirmed,
and shall continue in full force and effect until such time as the property is rezoned or the
prior zoning action of the City Council is amended through the zoning approval process
established by this Zoning Ordinance.

(e) CBD, Central Business District.
(1) General Purpose and Description.
The CBD, Central Business District, is intended to accommodate the commercial,
office, service, residential, public activities and uses commonly found in a central
business district. There shall be only one contiguous CBD, Central Business District.
(2) Location of CBD District.

provisions of Article 3 of this Ordinance.
b. Street Presence and Storefront Development. All new development in the
CBD district shall utilize the storefront development pattern or provide a
building façade and sidewalk along the street right-of-way. Such a façade shall
also meet the Ground Floor Window Standards requirements in the
Standards for Non-Residential Uses Section in Article 3.
c. No new front yard off-street parking is allowed in the CBD district.
(f) CGN, General Commercial District.
(1) General Purpose and Description.
The CGN, General Commercial District, is intended for the conduct of communitywide
personal and business services, specialty shops, and general highway
commercial development. The need for community-wide accessibility dictates that
this district is located ideally at the intersection of two or more streets or along
selected major streets designated for strip commercial development. Minimum lot
width, depth, area, and yard requirements, buffer strips, and landscaping have been
established to reduce the negative impact with typical commercial development.
Allowed uses are required to utilize public water and sewer infrastructure.
(2) Location of CGN Districts.
New CGN districts are most appropriately located adjacent to existing CGN districts
between other commercial districts and uses and other lower impact districts. CGN
districts should be located centered at intersections of streets, along major arterial
roads, and well served by major through transportation routes.
(3) Uses Allowed in the CGN Zoning District.
a. Principal uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval are
listed on Table 2-B.
b. Accessory uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval are

(g) CHV, Heavy Commercial Districts.
(1) General Purpose and Description.
Sec. 2-14. - Industrial Districts.
2-22
The CHV, Heavy Commercial District, is designed for intensive commercial uses such
as heavy automobile repair, contractors storage, and truck rental and sales and
those selected manufacturing uses that are compatible with such commercial
development. The permitted manufacturing uses are either free of objectionable
influences in their operations and appearance or can eliminate or control
objectionable characteristics by landscaping, screening, and other abatement
devices. Allowed uses are required to utilize public water and sewer infrastructure.
(2) Location of CHV District.
Because most of the uses in the CHV, Heavy Commercial District, often require
direct access to major streets and rail facilities, this district should be located near
major transportation routes. CHV zones should be used as a buffer or transition
between industrial development and commercial or multifamily residential
development.
(3) Uses Allowed in the CHV Zoning District.
a. Principal uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval are
listed on Table 2-B.
b. Accessory uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval are
listed on Table 2-C.
(4) Special Provisions Applicable in the CHV Zoning District.
Restrictions that apply to particular uses allowed by right or special exception
approval are referenced on Table 2-B and Table 2-C and are contained in Article 3
or other referenced articles of this Zoning Ordinance.
Sec. 2-14. - Industrial Districts.
(a) ILT, Light Industrial District Regulations.
(1) General Purpose and Description.
The ILT, Light Industrial District, is intended primarily for the conduct of light
manufacturing, assembling, and fabrication, and for warehousing, wholesaling, and
service operations that do not depend primarily on frequent personal visits of
customers or clients, but that may require good accessibility to major rail or
highways. This district is designed to upgrade industrial development standards,
prevent industrial blight, and protect light industrial development from
incompatible residential, commercial or heavy industrial uses. This district should
function as a buffer or transition between heavy industrial development and
commercial development. Allowed uses are required to utilize public water and
sewer infrastructure.
(2) Location of ILT Districts.
Sec. 2-14. - Industrial Districts.
2-23
New ILT districts are most appropriately located adjacent to existing ILT districts
between commercial districts/uses and lower impact districts. ILT districts should
be located along minor or major arterial roads.
(3) Uses Allowed in the ILT Zoning District.
a. Principal uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval are
listed on Table 2-B.
b. Accessory uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval are
listed on Table 2-C.
(4) Special Provisions Applicable in the ILT Zoning District.
Restrictions that apply to particular uses allowed by right or special exception
approval are referenced on Table 2-B and Table 2-C and are contained in Article 3
or other referenced articles of this Zoning Ordinance.
(b) IHV, Heavy Industrial District.
(1) General Purpose and Description.
a. The IHV, Heavy Industrial District, is intended to provide for heavy industrial
uses and other uses not otherwise provided for in the other districts. The
intensity of uses permitted in this district makes it necessary to separate it
from all residential districts and most commercial districts wherever possible.
b. Allowed uses are required to utilize public water and sewer infrastructure.
(2) Location of IHV Districts.
New IHV districts are most appropriately located adjacent to existing IHV districts
between light industrial districts/uses and lower impact districts. IHV districts
should be located along minor or major arterial roads.
(3) Uses Allowed in the IHV Zoning District.
a. Principal uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval are
listed on Table 2-B.
b. Accessory uses that are allowed by right or by special exception approval are
listed on Table 2-C.
(4) Special Provisions Applicable in the IHV Zoning District.
Restrictions that apply to particular uses allowed by right or special exception
approval are referenced on Table 2-B and Table 2-C and are contained in Article 3
or other referenced articles of this Zoning Ordinance.
(c) PIP, Planned Industrial Park District.
(1) General Purpose and Description.
The PIP, Planned Industrial Park District, is intended to provide for planned, orderly,
and efficient improvement of industrial properties in a campus-style development
Sec. 2-15. - Mixed Use Districts.
2-24
that supports clean industry, such as business/technology parks, research and
development centers, laboratories, data centers, business incubator centers,
biotech facilities, and warehouse flex space. The master planning process allows
for flexibility to meet the changing condition of economic development, while
maintaining the health and safety of the city by applying environmental and design
standards. Allowed uses are required to utilize public water and sewer
infrastructure.
(2) Location of PIP District.
New PIP districts are most appropriately located in areas with convenient access to
arterial streets and preferably with access to rail lines. Furthermore, Planned
Industrial Parks shall be planned appropriately and located in areas of compatible
land uses so as not to create noise, sight, or air pollution.
(3) Uses Allowed in the PIP Zoning District.
Allowed uses are established through approval of the master-planned
development. See the Master Planned Developments Article of this Zoning
Ordinance for details.
Sec. 2-15. - Mixed Use Districts.
(a) MXD, Mixed Use Development District.
(1) General Purpose and Description.
The overall purpose of the MXD, Mixed Use District, is to allow and encourage
flexibility and creativity in the design and development of comprehensively
planned, mixed-use centers. It is intended that this zone provide a more adaptable
approach to the comprehensive design and development of mixed-use centers than
the procedures and regulations applicable under other various conventional zoning
categories and planned development zones. In so doing, it is intended that this
zoning category be utilized to implement existing public plans and pertinent City
policies in a manner and to a degree more closely compatible with said City plans
and policies than may be possible under other zoning categories. The specific
purposes of this zone are:
a. To encourage residential uses in conjunction with commercial and other
compatible activities in order to create an active street life, enhance the
vitality of businesses, and reduce vehicular traffic.
b. Residential, commercial, and other non-residential uses shall be provided in
such a manner as to be codependant, functionally integrated, and
complementary of each other rather than random, non-integrated, and having
non-associative elements.
c. To encourage orderly, staged development of large-scale, comprehensively
planned mixed-use developments by providing procedures for the submission
Sec. 2-15. - Mixed Use Districts.
2-25
of a concept plan for an entire site and subsequent development plans for
each stage of development, as identified on the concept plan.
d. To provide, where appropriate, higher density residential uses integrated into
the overall mixed-use development.
e. To ensure compatibility of the proposed land uses with surrounding uses by
incorporating higher standards of project and site planning than could be
accomplished under conventional zoning categories.
f. To strengthen the Citys economic base and to provide proximate linkages
between employment opportunities and housing.
g. To encourage and provide for open space not only for use as setbacks and
yards surrounding structures and related walkways, but also conveniently
located with respect to points of residential and commercial and/or industrial
concentration so as to function for the general benefit of the community and
public at large as places for relaxation, recreation, and social activity. It is also
intended that open space and amenities be located so as to achieve the
physical and aesthetic integration of the uses and activities within each
development. In addition, structured parking within mixed-use planned
developments is encouraged to help achieve the open space and amenities
objectives of the zone. Where surface parking is necessary, the purposes of
this zone may be achieved by the provision of additional landscaping.
h. To encourage and provide for the development of comprehensive
nonvehicular circulation networks, separated from vehicular roadways, which
constitute a system of linkages among residential areas, open spaces,
recreational areas, commercial and industrial areas, and public facilities.
i. To promote development that is compatible and complementary in design to
the traditional style of building in the City of Newnan, and that establishes a
pedestrian-oriented development.
j. To encourage and provide for efficient use of energy resources.
k. To promote the adaptive reuse of older structures for the purpose of
stabilizing and improving property values, to encourage neighborhood
conservation, to foster civic pride in the beauty and accomplishments of the
past; to protect and enhance the City's attractions to tourists and visitors, to
strengthen and help diversify the economy of the City, and to promote the use
of historical-cultural landmarks for education, pleasure and welfare of the
community.
(2) Location of MXD District.
MXD districts are most appropriately located in developed urban areas or in areas
of transition between less and more intense land uses where they can serve as a
buffer between such land uses.
Sec. 2-16. - Overlay Districts.
2-26
(3) Uses Allowed in the MXD Zoning Districts.

(a) Purposes, Findings, Goals.
(1) The purpose of this Section is to establish general guidelines for the siting of
telecommunications towers, monopoles and antennas, and the facilities whereon
such towers, monopoles or antennas are located.
(2) The City Council recognizes that the City is to provide for the siting of
telecommunications towers, monopoles and antennas pursuant to the mandates
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Mobile Broadband Infrastructure
Leads to Development (BILD) Act of 2014, City Council also recognizes that
telecommunications towers, monopoles and antennas can negatively impact the
visual appearance of the city, and may reduce the value of property situated near
such installations, particularly residential properties.
(3) The goals of this Section are to:
a. Permit construction of new towers as an option of last resort, promoting
location of antennas on existing towers, buildings, and other suitable
structures;
b. Prohibit the location of towers, monopoles and antennas in residential areas
and minimize the total number of towers in the community;
c. Promote co-location of antennas on new and existing tower sites;
d. Encourage location of towers, monopoles and antennas in areas where
adverse impacts on the community are minimized;
e. Require tower and antenna installers to utilize construction technologies
which minimize adverse visual impacts of towers, monopoles or antennas;
f. Minimize the potential for damage to adjacent properties caused by tower or
monopole failure by requiring professional, engineering design and careful
siting of tower and monopole structures;
g. Establish an inventory of existing tower and antenna sites assembling specific
information about load capacity, land area available at individual sites, and any
terms or conditions which affect the possibility of co-location on the site; and
h. Provide for removal of towers which are abandoned by all users, setting forth
the time period within which this requirement shall apply.
(b) Approval of Telecommunications Facility.
Sec. 3 -62. - Telecommunication Facilities.
It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, repair, relocate, construct, or maintain within
the City any telecommunications facility as defined in this Zoning Ordinance, without
first obtaining either administrative or special exception approval in the manner set
forth in this Ordinance and in compliance with the terms herein.
(1) Issuance Standards.
a. Approval of telecommunications facilities are guided by the following
policies:
1. Preference is assigned to sites on which topography, vegetation and/or
buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening
or sites which lend themselves to mitigation of visual impacts.
2. Facilities should be located to minimize any adverse effect on
residential property values, scenic rural character, and resident sense of
privacy.
3. Less obtrusive facilities such as monopoles are preferred over lattice or
guyed towers. Preference is also assigned to proposed facilities which
are architecturally and visually compatible concerning color, bulk and size
with surrounding environment, including buildings, structures, vegetation
and uses likely to develop in the underlying zoning district.
4. Applications must demonstrate the relationship of the proposed facility
to the overall low power mobile radio service system network within
Coweta County.
5. Preference is assigned to facilities proposed for lots that permit
telecommunications facilities, particularly those lots surrounded by
property developed in uses compatible, that is, concerning building and
structure characteristics, with the proposed facilities. Rezoning of
residential property to permit installation of such facilities is discouraged.
b. The following factors shall be considered in evaluating an application for a
special exception use to install a telecommunications tower or monopole:
1. Height of the proposed tower or monopole;
2. Proximity of the tower or monopole to residential structures and
residential district boundaries, as measured from the base of the tower
or monopole to the boundary of a residentially-zoned lot;
3. Nature of uses on adjacent and surrounding properties;
4. Surrounding topography;
5. Provision an opaque fence or opaque vegetative buffer to fully screen
the tower or monopole, or telecommunications facility to a height of 6
feet from adjacent properties and right-of-ways;
Sec. 3 -62. - Telecommunication Facilities.
6. Design of the tower or monopole, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
7. Proposed ingress and egress;
8. Conformance to the standards and conditions required by this Section
to obtain approval of either a conditional or special exception use; and
9. Availability of suitable existing towers, monopoles and other structures
for the placement of an antenna or antennas. No new tower shall be
permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable
satisfaction of the City that no existing telecommunications facility can
accommodate the applicants proposed antenna(s). Evidence submitted
to demonstrate such findings shall include, but not be limited to, the
following: No existing towers, monopoles or structures meeting the
height, structural strength needs of the applicant are located within the
appropriate geographic area.
c. Procedure for approval of an antenna or antennas.
1. The Planning and Zoning Department shall determine whether an
application for location of an antenna on an existing building, structure,
tower or monopole should be issued or denied under the standards of
this Section within 30 days of receipt of a complete application. If the
Planning and Zoning Department fails to respond to the applicant within
said 30 days, then the application shall be deemed to be approved.
2. Any decision by the Planning and Zoning Department to deny an
application for an antenna shall be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record. The Planning and
Zoning Departments decision to deny an application may be appealed
to the Planning Commission by filing a written notice of appeal within
10 days of the denial. Failure to file a notice of appeal within 10 days of
the denial shall constitute a waiver of the applicants appeal rights.
3. The Planning Commission shall hold a hearing within 45 days of receipt
of the notice of appeal. In the event the Planning Commission affirms the
Planning and Zoning Departments decision to deny the application, the
decision of the Board shall be in writing and supported by substantial
evidence contained in a written record. The decision of the Planning
Commission shall be final.
d. Procedure for approval of a tower or monopole as a special exception use.
1. No special exception use for construction of a tower or monopole shall
be approved until an application has been filed with the Planning and
Zoning Department and considered by the Planning Commission. The
Commission shall transmit its report either recommending approval or

the tower and base facility from adjacent properties throughout the year. The
landscaped buffer must include an opaque fence or vegetative buffer sufficient to
screen the tower and base facility completely to a height of 6 feet from adjacent
properties and right-of-ways. Where topography and existing conditions permit,
the required 50 foot horizontal buffer should be an undisturbed buffer; provided,
however, the buffer may be crossed by an access drive of not greater than 20 feet
in width.
(2) Erection of any tower abutting property zoned other than residential shall require
a landscaped, buffer a minimum width of 15 foot that effectively screens the view
of the tower and base facility from adjacent properties. Such buffer must include
an opaque fence or vegetative buffer sufficient to screen the tower and base facility
completely to a height of 6 feet from adjacent properties and right-of- ways.
(3) Existing, mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved
to the maximum extent possible. Where towers or telecommunications facilities
are sited on wooded lots in excess of 5 acres, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
(4) In locations where the visual impact of the tower or telecommunications facility
would be minimal, such as developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping
requirement may be reduced or waived.
(j) Principal, Accessory and Joint Uses Associated with Towers or Monopoles.
(1) Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower or monopole shall be
permitted, but shall not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor
storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower
facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the
tower or monopole are being made.
(2) Towers or monopoles may be located on sites containing another principal use
within the same buildable area. Provided all siting, set back, separation, and
general requirements of this Ordinance are met, towers or monopoles may
Sec. 3 -62. - Telecommunication Facilities.
occupy a leased parcel on a site meeting the minimum lot size requirements for
the zoning district in which it is located. When joint use of a lot is permitted, the
City shall require the execution of a unity of title if two or more lots are utilized for
setback purposes or to prohibit the unlawful division of a lot containing a tower and
another principal use.
(3) Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes
the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous
materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas or other dangerous chemicals or
compounds.

facility fails to comply with the Citys building and technical codes or with the
requirements of this Section, and upon written notice provided to the owner of
such facility, the owner shall have 45 days to bring the facility into compliance
with this Section. Should the owner fail to bring the telecommunications facility
into compliance within said 45 days, the City may proceed with removal of such
facility pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Citys Building Code and place a
lien upon the property for the costs of such removal.
(5) If upon inspection or upon receipt of an engineers report submitted pursuant to
this Section, the Building Official determines that a telecommunications tower,
antenna or monopole has not been utilized for a continuous period of 12 months,
such tower, antenna or monopole shall be considered abandoned, and the owner
shall remove the same within 90 days of receipt of written notice from the City
notifying the owner of such abandonment. If the tower, antenna or monopole is
not removed within said 90 days, the City may proceed with removal of such
facility pursuant to the provisions of the Citys Building Code and place a lien upon
the property for the costs of such removal.
(n) Preexisting Antennas, Towers, or Telecommunications Facilities.
(1) Any pre-existing antennas, towers, or telecommunications facilities which do not
meet the requirements of this Section shall be considered nonconforming and
subject to the nonconforming use provisions of the Newnan Zoning Ordinance;
however, installation of an antenna or antennas on a preexisting tower or monopole
shall not constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use provided the new
antenna(s) adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the pre-existing tower or
monopole. Nor shall the addition of buildings or structures accessory to such
antenna(s) constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use, provided all applicable
building permits are obtained.
Sec. 3 -62. - Telecommunication Facilities.
(2) Maintenance, repairs or alterations to legal nonconforming telecommunications
towers necessary to maintain the tower in good condition and repair may be
performed. The weight bearing capacity and wind loading capacity of a tower may
only be increased to the extent required to maintain the tower in conformance with
state and national standards associated with the weight bearing capacity and wind
loading capacity for the number of antennas otherwise allowed on the tower as set
forth in this Section.
(3) Existing antennas may be replaced with another antenna(s) intended to provide
the same service.
(4) A legal nonconforming telecommunications tower that is damaged by fire, flood,
wind, earthquake, ice or other natural causes, to the extent of not more than 50%
of its appraised market value at that time, may be restored and the same use or
occupancy resumed, provided that such restoration is initiated within a period of
one year from the date of such damage and is diligently pursued to completion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, television and radio stations and land mobile
operators shall be entitled to repair, reconstruct or rebuild their towers, but only
to the minimal extent necessary to resume broadcasting and to fulfill the

DIVISION IV  ALTERNATIVE RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATIONS
Sec. 3-68. - Purpose and Intent.
The purpose of this Division is, on a limited basis that preserves and protects the
character of existing single-family neighborhoods and other neighborhoods as applicable, to
recognize that as the demographic makeup of Newnan changes, alternative housing options
(otherwise known as secondary or subordinate residential units) must be available to meet
the needs of specific groups of households. These households include but are not limited to
retirees, "empty nesters," the elderly, physically or mentally challenged persons, single person
households, developmentally disabled persons, and family members of the primary residential
unit occupant. It is the intent of this Division to provide residential options for these persons
and to regulate these options so as not to detract from the residential character of the
neighborhoods in which they exist. Finally, the intent of this Division is to
Sec. 3-71. - General Provisions.
achieve specific community-oriented goals including permitting older homeowners to
remain in their homes in the face of fixed incomes, rising expenses such as taxes and
maintenance, physical infirmities, or the death of a spouse; the stimulation of new,
moderate cost rental housing; preserving the vitality of older neighborhoods; and regulating
the quantity, quality, and location of alternative residential unit types whereas the lack of such
regulation can lead to the establishment of illegal units lacking adequate space, safety, and
located in a haphazard and uncontrolled manner.

areas of the site, such as parking areas, bicycle parking, recreational areas, common
outdoor areas, and any pedestrian amenities.
Sec. 4-11. - Homeowners and Other Associations.
For specific development options contained within this Ordinance, a homeowners,
condominium, merchants, business, or other association may be required as a part of the
approval process. The minimum provisions for such covenants are provided as appropriate and
shall be included in such covenants. However, the City of Newnan does not have any
responsibility nor right to enforce specific provisions contained within the covenants of a
homeowners or any other similar association.
DIVISION II  MEASUREMENTS AND CALCULATIONS USED IN THIS ORDINANCE
There are several types of formulas and calculations which are used in conjunction with
the regulations in this Ordinance. This Division provides an explanation of the calculations used
and provides an example of practical use.
Sec. 4-13. - Fractional Requirements.
When any requirement of this Ordinance results in a fraction of a dwelling unit or other
measurement or calculation, that fraction shall be disregarded and the nearest lower whole
number shall apply. Whenever a density calculation for a lot of record existing prior to the
adoption of this Ordinance results in less than one dwelling unit being permitted, the fractional
requirement shall be disregarded and one dwelling unit will be permitted.
Sec. 4-14. - Standard Density Calculation.
Permitted gross density shall be determined by the following method:
Sec. 4-14.  Standard Density Calculation.
4-7
GLA = Gross Land Area
DUA = Dwelling Units per Acre
PGRU = Permitted Gross Residential Units
GLA * DUA = PGRU
Example: 100-acre parcel (GLA)
RS-15 zoning district allows 3 DUA
100 * 3 = 300 maximum dwelling units allowed (PGRU)
(Note: All lots must meet minimum lot size for the district)
Sec. 4-15. - Floor Area Ratio (FAR).
Floor area ratio shall be determined by the following method:
GFA = Gross Floor Area
TPS = Total Parcel Size
GFA / TPS = FAR
Example: GFA = 100,000 square feet
TPS = 1.15 acres or 50,000 square feet
100,000 / 50,000 = FAR of 2.00
Sec. 4-16. - Length/Width Ratio (LWR).
Length/width ratio shall be determined by the following method:
L = Length
W = Width
LWR = Length / Width
Example: Length of Parcel A = 339 feet
Width of Parcel A = 113 feet
339 / 113 = 3:1 Length / Width Ratio
Sec. 4-17. - Slope.
Slope shall be determined by the following method:
(Vertical Distance [Rise] / Horizontal Distance [Run]) x 100 = Slope Percent
Example: Vertical Distance = 25 feet
Horizontal Distance = 1000 feet
(25 / 1000) x 100 = 2.5% slope
Sec. 4-18. - Open Space.
4-8
Sec. 4-18. - Open Space.
Unless specified otherwise in this Ordinance, open space shall be determined by the
following method:
GLA = Gross Land Area
DUA = Dwelling Units per Acre
PGRU = Permitted Gross Residential Units
OSU = Open Space per Unit
OS = Open Space (See Interpretation and Definitions Article for definition)
GLA * DUA = PGRU
PGRU * OSU = OS
Example: 100-acre parcel (GLA)
3 dwelling units per acre (DUA)
1,000 sq. ft. of open space per unit (OSU)
100 * 3 = 300 maximum dwelling units allowed (PGRU)
300 * 1,000 = 300,000 sq. ft. or 6.89 acres of open space
Sec. 4-19. - Impervious Surface.
Impervious surface shall be calculated by the following method:
GLA = Gross Land Area
BC = Building Coverage
PA = Paved Area
IOS = Impervious Open Space (open space consisting of impervious materials)
IS = Impervious Surface
BC + PA + IOS = IS
Example: 10-acre parcel (GLA)
2.25 acres in building coverage
2.50 acres of paved area including driveways, parking area, curb and
gutter, and sidewalks
0.25 acres of impervious open space
2.25 + 2.5 + 0.25 = 5.00 acres of impervious surface
Sec. 4-20. - Lot Area.
4-9

a. Are largely undeveloped but in the path of rapid substantial commercial or
industrial development which it is anticipated will radically change the character
of the lands within the district boundaries.
b. Are major commercial corridors with high visibility which will have a strong
influence on the perception of the City of Newnan.
c. Are commercial corridors or districts which have been developed haphazardly
or have deteriorated and are in need of visual improvements.
d. Are areas in need of commercial or industrial investment which is currently not
being attracted due to poor area perception or high investment risk.
(2) This district is designed to encourage high quality development by establishing
restrictions and standards to protect the natural environment, provide a sense of
place and orientation, promote optimum development, and so that investment
values will be maximized and will not be endangered by unsightly, undesirable, or
incompatible developments descending upon adjacent properties in the foreseeable
future.
(3) The QDC district shall overlay other zoning districts so that all lands lying within the
QDC district shall also be included within other zoning districts. Each parcel of land
with the QDC district shall be subject to the provisions, regulations, standards, and
restrictions of both the QDC district and of the other zoning districts within which it
lies.
(b) Designation of the QDC Overlay District.

DIVISION I  PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS
Sec. 6-3. - General Purpose and Description.
The Planned Development (PD) district is a residual district which shall no longer allow
new designation through rezoning, with the exception that Planned Development Residential
Districts (PDR) may be allowed through rezoning. The primary purpose of this Article is to
administer to the completion of already approved PD projects and any new PDR projects. It is
the specific purpose and intent of the Planned Development district:
(a) To provide for the planned, orderly, and efficient improvement of large, unique or
strategically situated landholdings while protecting the natural open space, ecological,
topographical, geological, and/or historic features which may exist, from damage which
might occur from development permitted by conventional zoning and subdivision
regulations. Such features may include but not necessarily be limited to steep slopes, soils,
streams and other water bodies, woodlands and pasturelands, wetlands, watershed lands,
flood plains, historic structures or sites, cultural features, and scenic views.
(b) To encourage protected open space to be accumulated into larger contiguous open space
tracts.
(c) To allow for a more efficient and imaginative development of a specific property.
(d) To permit property to be used in a manner not sanctioned by the existing district
regulations in harmony with and without detriment to neighboring properties.
(e) To provide a review process by the Planning Commission which will allow them an
opportunity to evaluate whether the proposed development will be in harmony with the
character of the neighborhood in which the development is located.
(f) To encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan
of development rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. This may permit buildings to be
clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a
pedestrian scale, and other public benefits.
Sec. 6-4. - Types of Planned Unit Developments.
6-4
(g) To encourage better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities, and
flexibility in design.
(h) To encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in project and site planning and to assure the
provision of park and recreation land and facilities for the use of the occupants of the
development in order to obtain a more desirable environment.
(i) To provide for a mixture of housing types such as detached single-family homes, twofamily
homes, townhouses, apartments, zero lot line homes, etc. in order to be responsive
to changing market demands and conditions and to the introduction of innovative designs
while assuring adequate privacy, light and air, interior space, freedom from noise and
traffic, and access to open space and recreation.
(j) Encourage the mixing of uses as appropriate including housing, neighborhood commercial,
office, cultural, institutional, and other compatible uses.
(k) For mixed-use developments with a residential component, to provide for a variety of
housing types such as detached single-family houses, two-family homes, townhouses,
apartments, zero lot line development, etc.
(l) Discourage clearly incompatible land uses and prevent conflicts where such uses cannot
be physically separated by the use of buffer strips and open space, gradations in the
intensity of use, control of traffic patterns (through the arrangement of streets), the
arrangement of uses in relation to topography, and other means.
(m) To facilitate more affordable and efficient housing by providing possibilities for cost
savings in infrastructure, installation costs, and energy costs through clustering of
dwellings and other structures and other means.
(n) To provide a linkage to any public or private transit system within and adjacent to the
development by effective organization of uses and the orientation of pedestrian and
vehicular facilities.
(o) To encourage pedestrian circulation within and adjacent to the PD development.
(p) Provide long range stability in the planning of public facilities and services for the area
through the use of a master plan specifying the arrangement and scheduling of the various
land use components and project phases.
(q) Zoning district and use requirements are set forth in the Use of Land and Structures

Sec. 6-7. - Planned Developments Approved Prior to the Date of Adoption of This Article.
Requirements for planned developments have been significantly modified from earlier
versions and therefore some transitional rules and privileges will be necessary. Any PD district
without an approved project plan will be required to adhere to all of the requirements of this
Article. For PD developments with an approved project plan or approved project plan and
phase plan, the following shall govern:
(a) Approved Project Plan.
Planned developments having received approval for a project plan or concept plan
applicable to the entire planned development project area, the layout and related
elements permitted as a part of receiving approval shall be grandfathered. If land use was
approved, the land uses proposed shall be permitted to be developed. If circulation
routes were approved, these circulation routes shall remain and be developed as
approved except that a revised project plan may require a modification to circulation
patterns. The GDOT may also require modifications to circulation patterns and other
transportation elements of the plan. If specific density of land use elements was
approved, these densities may be developed as approved. If the project plan contains no
specific reference to land use, circulation, or density, a revised project plan will be
required to consider those elements not approved as a part of the original plan. Project
plan revisions must be recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the
City Council if:
(1) The proposed use of any phase or land use area is to be changed to another use.
(2) Any phase or land use area is to be reduced or enlarged by more than 10%.
(3) Any proposed additions or deletions to the land area of the PD development. PD
projects may only be enlarged to further a public purpose such as to make
Sec. 6-8. - PDR, Planned Residential Development District.
6-9
transportation or circulation improvements, to increase public open space, to
provide additional buffering between incompatible uses, to better connect to the
urban fabric outside of the PD project area, or other purpose as deemed appropriate
by the City Council after a recommendation from the Planning Commission. In no
case shall any existing PD be enlarged more than 10% maximum beyond the area
existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance.
(4) Vehicular or pedestrian circulation routes are to be rerouted, added to or deleted
from, or modified as to the design of the facility.
(b) Project plan revisions must only be approved by the Planning Commission if:
(1) Any phase or land use area is to be reduced or enlarged by 10% or less.
(2) Changes are proposed to the open space, or other required elements of the project.
(3) Staff may administratively approve changes to the following elements provided that
such change is consistent with the provisions of this Section:
(4) Proposed changes to landscaping elements (will require the submittal of a revised
landscape plan).
(5) Proposed changes to sign package.
(c) Approved Phase Plan or Preliminary Plat.
If, in addition to a project or concept plan, a plan for a specific phase of an approved
planned development has also been approved, the specifications of the plan approved by
the Planning Commission shall be allowed.
(d) Revised Project or Phase Plans.
Major revisions or amendments to project or phase plans shall subject the plans to review
based on the complete provisions of this Division. Revisions resulting in changes to the
land uses or layout of previously approved plans shall include elements such as open
space or other requirements of this Division that prior versions of the Planned
Development district may not have required. Additions to previously approved phase
plans will require approval of the phase that land area is to be added to plus the phase
that land area will be removed from. Such additions will require adherence to current
regulations including the provision of open space.
Sec. 6-8. - PDR, Planned Residential Development District.
(a) General Purpose and Description.
The PDR Planned Residential Development zoning district allows residential development
in a manner open to and advocating innovation in design and layout. The principal uses of
land in this district are residential with related recreational, cultural, community, and
educational facilities normally required to provide the basic elements of a balanced,
orderly, convenient, and attractive residential area. Internal stability, harmony,
Sec. 6-10. - PDO, Planned Office and Institutional District.
6-10
attractiveness, order and adequate light, air and open space for dwellings and related
facilities and by consideration of arrangement of the different uses permitted in this
district.
(b) Location of PDR Districts.
PDR districts may be located where sufficient land and infrastructure exists or is planned
for which will allow for a development that meets the standards and requirements of this
section.
(c) Dimensional Requirements.
Refer to Table 6-A for general dimensional requirements.
Sec. 6-9. - PDC, Planned Commercial Development District.
(a) General Purpose and Description.
The PDC Planned Commercial Development zoning district provides for primarily
commercial development in a manner encouraging innovation in design and layout. The
principal uses of land in this district are commercial with related facilities normally
required to provide the basic elements of a balanced, orderly, convenient, functional, and
attractive commercial area.
(b) Location of PDC Districts.
Planned Commercial Development districts must be located adjacent to a major arterial
roadway and be centrally located to serve a wide area of the community. Since innovative
site planning is a component of this district, the City may be flexible regarding the
permitted location of this district type.
(c) Dimensional Requirements.
Refer to Table 6-A for general dimensional requirements.
Sec. 6-10. - PDO, Planned Office and Institutional District.
(a) General Purpose and Description.
The PDO Planned Office and Institutional zoning district provides for primarily office
development in a manner encouraging innovation in design and layout. The principal uses
of land in this district are office with related facilities normally required to provide the
basic elements of a balanced, orderly, convenient, functional, and attractive commercial
area.
(b) Location of PDO Districts.
PDO districts are most suitably located on arterial or non-residential collector streets
between uses of higher and lower intensity or in areas where other office uses are
located. PDO districts can serve as an effective transitional area between a more intensive
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
6-11
use such as commercial and residential uses. PDO districts should not be located at major
street intersections but are more suitably sited in mid-block areas or interior areas of sites.
(c) Dimensional Requirements.
Refer to Table 6-A for general dimensional requirements.
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
All Planned Developments, in addition to meeting the intent of this Division, shall meet
the following standards and such other requirements as are set forth with respect to each of
the three permitted types of Planned Developments.
(a) General Standards and Requirements.
(1) Preservation of Features.
The development shall be compatible with the existing topography of the land and
shall preserve any unusual topographic or natural features. Requests to waive this
standard must be accompanied by a report indicating that the proposed
development is a significant community need that transcends the need to preserve
the topography and/or feature(s).
(2) Design Focus.
The development shall utilize design and development features that would not be
possible by the application of lot-by-lot zoning district regulations. It must be shown
that conventional development regulations would not allow the design of the
proposed project and that the project as proposed offers features that are an
improvement to conventional zoning from a community or public perspective.
(3) Land Disturbance.
No alteration or disturbance of land in a Planned Development district or the natural
or cultural resources thereon shall be permitted until the Project Plan has received
approval from the Planning Commission. Any subsequent land disturbance must be
consistent with the approval granted by the Planning Commission.
(4) Subdivision Regulations.
Land within a Planned Development shall be treated in its entirety as a subdivision
and thus subject to the provisions of the City of Newnan Subdivision Ordinance and
Development Regulations, except as follows:
All land subdivision is included regardless of size, land use, purpose of
subdivision, or whether new streets are involved.
Preliminary and final plats shall follow the procedures and meet all of the
requirements of the City of Newnan Subdivision Ordinance and Development
Regulations which shall be supplemented by the requirements of this Division.
Wherever there is a conflict between the provisions of the Subdivision
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
6-12
Ordinance and Development Regulations and this Division, the provisions of this
Division shall govern.
(5) Integrated Functional Design.
Planned Developments must be built as a single integrated design entity. While a PD
development may be subdivided subject to the provisions of this Section and the City
of Newnan Subdivision Ordinance, every lot shall be contiguous and the PD shall not
be fragmented or separated by non-PD lands.
Interconnectivity of Land Uses/Phases.
Each phase of the project shall not be isolated from adjacent phases or land use
areas. Each phase shall be served by at least one public roadway which shall
connect to all adjacent phases or land use areas. In addition, each phase or land
use area adjacent to land outside of the project boundary shall connect to such
adjacent land if such a connection is available. If one phase cannot reasonably
be connected to another via a public roadway, then a private road or drive may
be required. Such a private road must be open to the public at all times for
travel to the adjacent phase area. The project must contain a minimum of 2
primary access points from the outside.
Calculation of Density.
Land used for open space, common areas, and interior streets, drives,
sidewalks, and other circulation ways may be included as part of the land area
used for determining the number of dwelling units allowed, the maximum floor
area, or the amount of required land. Land characterized by floodplain, steep
slopes, wetlands, or other unbuildable or sensitive lands may not be included as
part of the land area for density calculations, except that a 25% density
provision may be applied to the buildable portion of the development.
Therefore, 25% of the land area of the unbuildable area may be added to the
buildable portion of the property to increase net density. Density is calculated
for the project and for individual phases. Within modules, density for a specific
product may exceed that permitted provided that the overall density for the
phase meet the required maximum density.
General Private Deed Covenants.
The entire PD district shall be included within private deed covenants running
with the land to assure the continuance of the planned residential development
in accordance with approved plans and developments. Refer to Sec. 6-11(a)(6)
for additional information.
(6) Ownership and Management Standards and Requirements.
Initial Ownership.
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
6-13
All of the land in a planned unit development shall be owned initially by an
individual, by a corporation, or by some other legal entity. Individual properties
in a planned unit development may be sold after a final plat has been recorded
for each phase with the properties subject to private deed covenants that
assure the continuance of the Planned Development as originally approved.
Single Ownership and Design.
Planned Developments must be built as a single integrated design entity. The
project must be under single ownership or control when the project receives
final approval. Should any part of the project be designed for ownership
transfer, this shall be so stated in the application. The management plan for the
development shall include language that ties subsequent owners of any part of
the development to belong to a management entity or association overseeing
the entire PD site. A PD development may be subdivided subject to the
provisions of this Section and the City of Newnan Subdivision Ordinance.
However, every lot shall be contiguous and the PD shall not be separated by
non-PD lands.
Owner/Developer Responsibilities.
Initial Owner/Developers of PD projects are responsible for the following
elements of the project:
1. Development and maintenance of general common area.
2. Development of arterial and other major roadways and related
infrastructure serving the development including the extension of utilities
to serve the development.
3. Development of the management plan including development of general
covenants, management association set up, and related responsibilities to
assure that ownership and management standards are met in full.
4. All approvals and conditions therefrom received related to the PD and its
elements.
5. That all overall requirements such as landscaping and open space meet PD
requirements.
Change of Ownership.
Any conditions attached to an approved PD plan or subdivision plat shall not
lapse or be waived as a result of any subsequent change in tenancy or
ownership of said land.
Management Association or Governing Board.
Each property owner shall become a shareholder in the common ownership of
the PD development. Ownership for the purpose of the association can mean
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
6-14
ownership of the land, owning a share of a condominium or cooperative
development, or a commercial leasehold. Residential renters will not be
granted association membership. PD developments shall have two types of
documents that relate to governance, the deeds of ownership and the bylaws:
1. Deeds of Ownership.
These documents consist of the deeds of ownership; the warranties
conveyed and described in the deed; and a list of covenants, conditions,
and restrictions that are conditions of ownership upon the purchasers and
owners in the PD. The deeds describe the type of property conveyed, unit
of ownership of the purchaser, and property owned and directly managed
by the association. Deeds and warranties shall be conveyed to owners
from the developer or prior owners of the parcel. The developer shall
convey deeds and warranties to the association upon completion of
construction of the project and after 40% of units of ownership in the
project have been sold. Percentage share of ownership in the association
shall be determined by the percentage of acres held by the owner
compared to the development as a whole.
2. Bylaws.
Consist of three elements described as follows:
Association OrganizationThis element describes the organization of the
association including the composition and function of the board of
directors and executive officers; qualifications, duties, and number of
members of the board of directors; how often the board of directors shall
meet; whether committees or subcommittees may be established; and its
decision functions and obligations.
Association DutiesThe bylaws shall require the board of directors to
carry out the duties of the association through the officers of the
organization. The board may engage the services of paid staff, volunteers,
consultants, attorneys, or others to carry out administrative and other
functions of the association such as security, landscaping, maintenance,
litigation, public relations, and other duties as may be determined by the
board.
Shareholder DutiesThe bylaws specify the duties and obligations of the
individual shareholders as owners and occupants of the PD. The bylaws
shall list rules of behavior and rules limiting physical changes or remodeling
of buildings, structures, and lots. This element shall provide the amount of
association dues to be received from shareholders and how such dues are
set and modified. Finally, this element shall list penalties and remedies
that can be imposed on shareholders for violating the terms of the deeds
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
6-15
and bylaws which may include eviction and foreclosure on the unit of
shareholder ownership.
(7) Infrastructure Standards and Requirements.
Water, sewerage, street and school facilities, and other required infrastructure shall
be adequate for the proposed development or there shall be a definite proposal for
making them so. Infrastructure required as a part of all PD developments are as
follows:
Public water is required.
Public sewer is required.
Roads/Streets.
All interior streets and roads must meet the requirements for such facilities for
the City of Newnan as well as the following:
1. The City may require interior streets and sidewalks through the
development that connect to the existing street and sidewalk
infrastructure of the city.
2. The provision and/or design of streets is subject to review by the Planning
Commission which may require or allow modifications to the location,
layout, or capacity of roads or attach additional requirements such as turn
lanes, traffic circles, wider or narrower rights-of-way, pavement widths,
medians, traffic calming or other associated features and provided that
such modifications meet generally accepted traffic engineering and
planning principles that can be justified by the applicant and/or verified by
the Planning Commission. The full cost of City review of the proposed
modifications by a consulting traffic engineer shall be borne by the
applicant.
3. Public roads, road extensions, or other similar infrastructure shall be
provided according to the approved plan. Deviation from plans shall
require a revised development plan.
4. All major roadways and other transportation infrastructure serving a
Planned Development must be completed and publicly dedicated prior to
any building permits being issued.
Sidewalks.
Sidewalks shall be provided according to the requirements as specified in the
Citys Sidewalk Regulations and may be required by the Planning Commission
for other purposes.
Parking.
1. Parking Requirements.
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
6-16
All parking requirements shall be derived from the proposed uses making
up the project plan. Each use shall determine its share of required parking.
Moreover, spaces calculated for residential units, commercial uses, and
other permanent spaces shall be physically separated and dedicated
exclusively for that use.
2. Shared Parking.
A shared parking plan meeting the requirements of the Parking and
Loading Requirements Article of this Ordinance may be submitted with the
phase or site plan for approval.
3. Location of Parking.
Unless physically impossible, all parking for PD developments shall be
located to the rear, a combination of side and rear, or underground.
4. Illumination of Parking.
All parking areas shall be illuminated so as to provide appropriate visibility
and security during hours of darkness using technology and fixtures that
will not create a nuisance to other uses within the PD development nor to
uses adjacent or nearby the PD development.
Utilities.
All utility lines in a PD project shall be placed underground except that adaptive
reuse developments may have this provision waived upon a finding by City staff
that such requirement would require the replacement or relocation of existing
lines at a cost prohibitive to the economic rehabilitation of the building or site.
The developer or subdivider shall ensure final and proper completion and
installation of utility lines as provided in the subdivision regulations. Standards
for street lighting shall be provided by the developer in accordance with the
approved site plan.
(8) Landscaping Standards and Requirements.
Minimum standards for landscaping in PD developments are necessary to ensure that
higher standards of site planning are realized and to tie the separate elements of the
mixed use development together.
A landscape plan meeting the requirements of the City of Newnan landscape
requirements as specified in the Citys Tree Preservation and Landscaping
Ordinance must be submitted as part of a new or revised Project Plan. This can
be a separate plan or may be integrated with the Site Development Plan
requirements as part of the Project Plan submittal. If the project is phased, only
the submitted phase will be required to be provided in detail but calculations
and proposed plant materials and treatments must be provided for the entire
development.
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
6-17
Entry points to the development shall be landscaped in an attractive manner
using plant specimens utilized throughout the remainder of the development.
All interior and perimeter roads and streets shall provide street trees allowed by
the City of Newnan Plant Palate. Such trees shall be planted no more than 20
feet apart along all street frontages.
All boulevards shall provide attractive, low maintenance plantings in the center
islands and be grassed throughout the remainder of the islands.
Landscaping shall be provided adjacent to all buildings and structures including
solid waste receptacles.
A minimum 10% of the project site shall be landscaped.
(9) Open Space Standards and Requirements.
Common open space is an important element in a mixed use development serving to
provide resting and gathering places, recreation areas, aesthetic complements,
stormwater percolation areas, and other purposes. Open space for the purpose of
the PD district shall be defined as a portion of a lot or other area of land associated
with and adjacent to a building or group of buildings in relation to which it serves to
provide light and air, scenic, recreational, resting, or similar purposes. Such space
shall, in general, be available for entry and use by the occupants of the building(s)
with which it is associated. Open space may include a limited proportion of space so
located and treated as to enhance the amenity of development by providing
landscaping features, screening or buffering for the occupants or adjacent
landowners, or a general appearance of openness. Open space (not including
unbuildable lands such as steep slopes, wetlands, flood plain, and the like) will be
fully credited toward gross density. For every such acre of open space set aside, the
number of units which could have been developed on this open space may be
assigned to the remaining buildable portion of the property thereby increasing net
density for this area. However, gross density shall remain the same. General open
space requirements are as follows:
PD developments shall provide a minimum of 30% impervious surface for the
overall project area. This may vary from phase to phase but shall be a minimum
for the project as a whole.
PD developments shall have an overall maximum building coverage of 50%.
Specific land use types may vary.
A minimum of 15% common open space is required for all PD developments
except as provided in this Section or reduced under the provisions of Subsection
k below. Each phase of the development shall meet the following requirements:
1. Each phase shall contain a minimum of 15% open space; or
Sec. 6-11. - Planned Development Standards and Requirements.
6-18
2. Each phase shall contain a minimum of 7.5% open space provided that the
phase be directly adjoining other common open space of at least 1 acre in
size either within another phase of the PD development or outside of the

Section. Previously approved Planned Development districts shall follow the provisions of Sec.
6-7. As described in Sec. 6-6, PD projects have four distinct elements. Requirements for the
Project Plan, Phase Plan, and Site Plan elements are described in this Section.
(a) Project Plan.
(1) General Requirements.
The project plan is the plan for the development of the entire Planned
Development. The project plan shall identify the specific phases that the
project will consist of, all proposed general circulation transportation facilities,
land uses and proposed densities, and open spaces and natural site features to
be preserved between phase locations. If only one phase of the project is
proposed, the project must combine the requirements of the project and phase
plans into one submittal. Proposed major streets and other circulation
infrastructure along major corridors including sidewalks must be clearly
indicated on the plan. The applicant or developer of the PD is solely responsible
for the provision of major transportation facilities regardless of property
disposition. Such facilities must either be developed prior to approval of any
Phase Plan or a bond for 150% of the estimated cost of such infrastructure must
be provided to the City prior to the approval of any Phase Plan. Building permits
shall not be issued for any lot or parcel that is not located on a dedicated or
developmental public street or road.
The project plan shall consist of a professionally designed schematic plan
indicating the layout of the development. Two complete sets of the project plan
shall be submitted to the Planning & Zoning Department; 9 copies of each
graphic in 11x 17 format; and 2 color renderings of the plan on 36 x 48
claycoat or similar heavy duty paper. This plan shall contain the following
elements:
(2) Project Plan Elements.

units per acre for residential uses and floor area ratio (FAR) for non-residential
components;
Show a proposed vehicular and pedestrian circulation plan including entrances
and exits and connections to vehicular and pedestrian facilities external to the
project property. The project must have a reasonable mix of public and private
roadways to maximize circulation efficiency;
Show existing natural features of the site including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams,
wetlands, steep slopes, mature trees and tree stands, and other natural
features;
Show where proposed open space will be provided by type of open space
landscaped area, community green, plaza, formal or informal garden, natural
area set aside. Indicate proposed square footage or acreage and percentage of
open space as a part of total project. Also indicate where publicly dedicated
open space will be provided; and

The applicant shall provide a completed rezoning application and a cover letter
requesting review of the project plan that shall include a written narrative describing
how the proposed project meets the purposes of the Planned Development district
as provided in Sec. 6-3 and the purpose statement of the specific district(s)
requested.
(4) Review of Project Plan by Staff.
The project plan shall be reviewed by staff and discussed in an informal meeting with
the applicant to examine potential areas of non-conformity. Staff, upon review of
the plan, will determine whether the project meets the intent of the district and
includes the required elements. If the project does not meet with the intent or lacks
required elements, staff may reject the project plan. However, should the plan meet
the intent and contain the required elements, staff will accept the project plan and
provide the applicant with suggestions for changes and modifications, if any, that will
Sec. 6-12. - Application Procedures and Requirements.
6-24
prepare the applicant for the submittal of phase plans. While the applicant may ask
for more than one project plan review, at least one review is mandatory.
(5) Review of Project Plan by Planning Commission.
After staff officially accepts the project plan, the Planning Department places the
plan on the Planning Commission agenda provided that the date the plan is officially
accepted by staff is on or before the 15th of the month. After the 15th, the plan shall
be placed on the agenda for the following month. The Planning Commission shall
review the project plan and make a recommendation on the plan and the rezoning of
the property. The Planning Commission shall review the plan for the following
elements: how the proposed project meets the purpose of a Planned Development
as provided in Sec. 6-3; how the proposed project meets the purpose of the specific
Planned Development district; the overall project density as well as the density of
land use components; land use mix and percentages; general vehicular and
pedestrian circulation including the location and capacity of the facilities and
connections internally and externally; and open space type, amount, and location.
Other site and project design criteria shall be reviewed at the phase plan stage.
(6) Review of Project Plan by City Council.
Upon receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission and before
enacting an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, the City Council shall hold a public
hearing thereon, at least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing date,
notice of the time, place, and purpose of which shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City of Newnan. If approved, the rezoning becomes
effective and the project plan becomes the official plan for the district which will
determine how phase plans are developed. The project plan indicated the general
land use zones which are associated with the PD designations in this Section. Upon
approval of the plan, the applicant shall provide the City with 2 revised color
renderings of the plan on 36 x 48 claycoat or similar heavy duty paper.
(7) The following shall be inscribed on each Concept Plan prior to submittal to the City:
Pursuant to the Planned Development provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Newnan, Georgia, all the requirements of
Project Plan approval having been fulfilled including rezoning of the
property to a designation of PD and an acceptable concept plan which
shall serve to delineate phases and land use zones of the project, this
Project Plan was approved by the City Council at its meeting on
_____________, ____.
________________ _______________________________
Date City Manager
(8) Effect of Approval of Project Plan.
Sec. 6-12. - Application Procedures and Requirements.
6-25
If the project plan and rezoning are approved, the Planned Development district that
will have been established and all conditions and requirements attached to that
approval are binding on the property unless an amendment is approved. All
subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the
approved plan and conditions. The intent of this form of zoning is to provide a
voluntary alternative procedure for specific development proposals and as such it is
intended that all property zoned be in accordance with specific plans to develop.
Therefore, every 3 years from the date of approval of a project plan, the Planning
Commission will examine development progress to determine if it is proceeding in
full compliance with the conditions, provisions, and restrictions of approval. In the
event that the development does not comply with the approved plan, the Planning
Commission shall direct staff to prepare a findings report to City Council in which the
Planning Commission may recommend remedial action on the property which may
include the removal of Planned Development district zoning for the property.
(9) Minor Amendments to Approved Project Plan.
The Planning Commission is authorized to approve minor amendments to the Project
Plan provided that:
The applicant submits a revised set of plans detailing the proposed changes
along with a cover letter that addresses each proposed change.
That the proposed change:
1. Involve no more than a 5% increase in residential density.
2. Involve no more than a 5% increase in non-residential floor area.
3. Involve no more than a 10% decrease in parking allocated.
4. Involve no more than a 5% modification to a dimension including setbacks,
height, or lot width.
5. Involve no more than a 5% modification to any other measurable project
criteria.
That the proposed changes meet all of the requirements and provisions of this
Section.
That the proposed amendment not alter any approved site development
regulations of the plan and does not materially alter other aspects of the plan,
including traffic circulation, mixture of use types, or general physical layout.
(10) Major Amendments to Approved Project Plan.
Any proposed amendments not conforming with these provisions shall be considered
major amendments and resubmitted as a revised project plan. Any proposed
amendments which do not meet the minimum dimensional standards or other
Sec. 6-12. - Application Procedures and Requirements.
6-26
provisions of this Section shall be required to apply for a variance with the Planning
Commission.

DIVISION II  MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
Sec. 6-14. - Purpose.
(a) The overall purpose of the MXD, Mixed Use District, is to allow and encourage flexibility
and creativity in the design and development of comprehensively planned, mixed-use
centers. It is intended that this zone provide a more adaptable approach to the
comprehensive design and development of mixed-use centers than the procedures and
regulations applicable under other various conventional zoning categories and planned
development zones. In so doing, it is intended that this zoning category be utilized to
implement existing public plans and pertinent City policies in a manner and to a degree
more closely compatible with said City plans and policies than may be possible under
other zoning categories.
(b) See also the Use of Land and Structures Article for specific purposes of this district.
Sec. 6-15. - Applicability.
(a) The MXD District is a separate zoning district and shall follow the same amendment
procedures as other zoning districts. Unless otherwise indicated in this Division, the land
uses and development standards that are presented with the application for amendment
shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and shall become a part
of the zoning approval.
(b) Any MXD District that was approved prior to the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or
amendments to the Ordinance shall continue to be developed under the provisions and
conditions of zoning approval that applied at the time of rezoning.
Sec. 6-16. - Infrastructure Requirements.
6-32
Sec. 6-16. - Infrastructure Requirements.
(a) Utilities.
Public water and sewer is required. All utility lines in a MXD development shall be placed
underground except that adaptive reuse developments may have this provision waived
upon a finding by City staff that such requirement would require the replacement or
relocation of existing lines. The developer or subdivider shall ensure final and proper
completion and installation of utility lines as provided in the Subdivision Regulations.
Standards for street lighting shall be provided by the developer in accordance with the
approved site plan.
(b) Roads/Streets.
All interior streets and roads must meet the requirements for such facilities for the City of
Newnan. The city may require interior streets and sidewalks through the development
that connect to existing street and sidewalk infrastructure. Approved development plans
containing new public roads, road extensions, or other similar infrastructure shall be
provided according to the approved plan. Deviation from plans shall require a revised
development plan.
(c) Sidewalks.
Sidewalks are required on all perimeter roads and streets. An internal sidewalk or path
system must be provided. If the residential density of the project is greater than 4 units
per acre, sidewalks must be provided along the sides of all streets except residential culde-
sacs of 200 feet length or less. Sidewalks along exclusively residential frontages must
be a minimum of 4 feet in width and separated from the curb by a minimum 3 foot tree
lawn except that a sidewalk of 7 feet in width may be provided in lieu of a tree lawn

from traffic and late night activity. In addition, no amplified music shall be audible to
neighboring residents.
(e) Outdoor Lighting.
All outdoor lighting associated with commercial uses shall be designed so as not to
adversely impact surrounding residential uses, while also providing a sufficient level of
illumination for access and security purposes. Such lighting shall not be directed toward
residential units nor shall such lighting blink, flash, oscillate, or be of unusual brightness or
intensity.
(f) Storage of Refuse.
Commercial units shall maintain a separate refuse storage container from that used by
residential uses. It shall be clearly marked for commercial use only and use by residential
tenants is prohibited. Refuse storage containers shall be screened on all sides with a
latchable gate. Screening material shall be of the same finishing material predominantly
used on the principal building. Commercial refuse containers shall be screened by an
attractive fence or wall at least 6 feet in height.
Sec. 6-19. - Compatibility Standards.
(a) All uses shall conform to the purposes of the MXD district and shall be compatible with all
uses, existing or proposed, in the vicinity of the area covered by the proposed MXD
development. In order to assist in accomplishing such external compatibility, the following
requirements shall apply:
(1) No buildings other than single-family detached dwellings shall be constructed within
50 feet of adjoining property that is developed with single-family detached dwellings
unless the City Council finds that topographical or development features permit a
lesser setback. However, in no case shall the setback be less than 35 feet.
Sec. 6-20. - Minimum Landscaping Requirements.
6-35
(2) No building shall be constructed to a height greater than its distance from any
adjoining property designated for residential use on development plan, unless the
City Council finds that approval of a waiver of this requirement will not adversely
affect the adjacent property.
(b) MXD developments must provide public infrastructure improvements that are compatible
in design and function to those of surrounding and adjacent properties. Improvements
such as sidewalks, street lighting, trash receptacles, street furniture, and other public
elements shall be compatible unless this provision is waived by the City Council based on a
conclusion that the proposed improvements are a clear improvement over the existing
adjacent infrastructure or public elements.
(c) General Private Deed Covenants.
The entire MXD district shall be included within private deed covenants running with the
land to assure the continuance of the planned residential development in accordance with
approved plans and developments.
(d) Compliance with the requirements in Sec. 6-19 shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to
create a presumption of compatibility.
Sec. 6-20. - Minimum Landscaping Requirements.
Minimum standards for landscaping in MXD developments are necessary to ensure that
higher standards of site planning are realized and to tie the separate elements of the mixed use
development together.
(a) A landscape plan meeting the requirements of the "Tree Preservation and Landscaping
Ordinance within the City of Newnan Code of Ordinances must be submitted as part of the
preliminary development plan. This can be a separate plan or may be integrated with the
improvements plan required as part of the preliminary plan submittal. If the project is
phased, only the first phase will be required to be provided in detail but calculations and
proposed plant materials and treatments must be provided for the entire development.

DIVISION III  OPEN SPACE DISTRICTS
Sec. 6-29. - Purpose and Intent.
(a) The purpose of the Open Space districts is to provide an optional method of development
that encourages the provision of community open space for active or passive recreation,
the preservation of trees and other significant flora, the preservation of significant views
and vistas, the protection of sensitive environmental resources, and the enhancement of
the character and texture of the urban or suburban setting of the area.
(b) Further, the Open Space districts provide for the preservation of greenspace as a
nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure; provide a residential
zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally
Sec. 6-31. - CS, Conservation Subdivision District.
6-42
sensitive and efficient uses of the land; preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural
resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands
and wildlife habitat; permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally
sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces
and utility easements, necessary for residential development; reduce erosion and
sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential
development; promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the
community; promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions; encourage
interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street,
providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as
focal points in the neighborhood; encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and
reliance on main arteries; promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails
and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities,
businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles; conserve scenic views and
reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and
views of open space; and preserve important historic and archeological sites.
(c) These development options provide for flexibility in lot layout and variety in the types and
sizes of buildings developed while maintaining the same limitations on gross density of
dwelling units per acre in the general area; protecting the character of existing
neighborhoods or areas; and providing useable and valued open space for common use
and enjoyment.
Sec. 6-30. - Applicability.
(a) This Conservation Subdivision (CS) overlay option is available in the following residential
zoning districts as a use by right: RS-20, RS-15, RU-7. The applicant shall comply with all

(1) The applicant must identify the owner of the Open Space who is responsible for
maintaining the Open Space and facilities located thereon. If a Homeowners
Association is the owner, membership in the association shall be mandatory and
automatic for all homeowners of the subdivision and their successors. If a
Homeowners Association is the owner, the Homeowners Association shall have lien
authority to ensure the collection of dues from all members. The responsibility for
maintaining the Open Space and any facilities located thereon shall be borne by the
owner.
(2) Applicant shall submit a Plan for Management of Open Space and Common Facilities
(Plan) that:
Allocates responsibility and guidelines for the maintenance and operation of the
Open Space and any facilities located thereon, including provisions for ongoing
maintenance and for long-term capital improvements;
Estimates the costs and staffing requirements needed for maintenance and
operation of, and insurance for, the Open Space and outlines the means by
which such funding will be obtained or provided;
Provides that any changes to the Plan be approved by the Board of
Commissioners; and,
Provides for enforcement of the Plan.
(3) In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the Open Space fails to
maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and condition, the City of Newnan
may assume responsibility for its maintenance and may enter the premises and take
corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The costs of
such maintenance may be charged to the owner, Homeowners Association, or to the
individual property owners that make up the Homeowners Association, and may
include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on all
subdivision properties.
(e) Legal Instrument for Permanent Protection.
Sec. 6-33. - General Development Standards, Incentive Bonuses (CS).
6-48
(1) The Open Space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal instrument that is
recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be one of the following:
A permanent conservation easement in favor of either a land trust or similar
conservation-oriented non-profit organization with legal authority to accept
such easements. The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence
and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for
retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its
functions; or a governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals
compatible with the purposes of this ordinance.
A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a
governmental entity; or,
An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if approved by City
of Newnan.
(2) The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of
the Open Space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions contained in this
Article, as well as any further restrictions the Applicant chooses to place on the use of
the Open Space.
Sec. 6-33. - General Development Standards, Incentive Bonuses (CS).
(a) Incentive opportunities are provided to further encourage quality development and
additional preservation of natural resources.
(b) Incentive bonuses are considered to be a privilege extended by the City of Newnan and
not a use by right. Incentive bonuses may be granted by the Planning Commission if it is
determined that they advance the quality of the development, preserve additional natural
resources, and are of a benefit to the City of Newnan.
(c) Incentive bonuses are to be decided by the Planning Commission during the preliminary
plat approval process. The potential incentive bonuses are as follows:
(1) Bonus for Quality Open Space.
Developments that provide at least 50% of the open space in areas classified as
Secondary Conservation Areas are eligible to receive a 5% increase in the maximum
number of permitted lots.
(2) Bonus for Additional Open Space.
Developments that provide at minimum 50% of the gross tract area as restricted
open space are eligible receive a 3% increase in the maximum number of permitted
lots.
(3) Bonus for Quality Building Materials.
Sec. 6-34. - General Site Planning Standards and Procedures (CS).
6-49
Developments that deed-restrict homes to four-sided brick, stone, or cement board
are eligible to receive a 3% increase in the maximum number of permitted lots.
Sec. 6-34. - General Site Planning Standards and Procedures (CS).
While the Conservation Subdivision (CS) overlay is a use by right per this Zoning
Ordinance, application must be made to the City for a project to be recognized as such. The
application consists of five submittals, listed in order below. Each submittal will require Staff
approval. The Preliminary Plat requires approval of the Planning Commission.
(a) Site Analysis Map Required.
(1) Prior to submission of the preliminary subdivision plat, the applicant shall prepare
and submit a site analysis map.
(2) The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site features
have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the
proposed Open Space will meet the requirements of this Division.
(3) The site analysis map shall be approved following a visual inspection of the site by
City Staff.
(4) The site analysis map shall include the following features:
Property boundaries;
All streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features;
Topographic contours of no less than 10-foot intervals;
All Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas labeled by type, as described in
Sec. 6-32;

(b) Housing Density Determination Required.
A preliminary plat showing the highest density achievable in the underlying zoning district,
with open space meeting the Sec. 6-31, shall be submitted. This plat will reflect the
maximum number of lots allowed in the Conservation Subdivision. This plat shall be
prepared by a civil engineer, landscape architect, or land surveyor currently registered in
the State of Georgia at the behest of the applicant. The preliminary plat will meet all
specifications as detailed in the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Newnan.
(c) Preliminary Plat Required.
Sec. 6-35. - OSD-2, Urban Open Space Design District.
6-50
A preliminary plat meeting the open space and lot dimension standards of the
Conservation Subdivision overlay shall be submitted. This plat shall be prepared by a civil
engineer, landscape architect, or land surveyor currently registered in the State of Georgia
at the behest of the applicant. The preliminary plat will meet all specifications as detailed
in the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Newnan, and must be approved by the
Planning Commission.
(d) Open Space Management Plan Required.
An open space management plan, as described in Sec. 6-32(d), shall be prepared and
submitted prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
(e) Instrument of Permanent Protection Required.
An instrument of permanent protection, such as a conservation easement or permanent
restrictive covenant and as described Sec. 6-32(e), shall be placed on the Open Space
concurrent with the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
Sec. 6-35. - OSD-2, Urban Open Space Design District.
(a) General Purpose and Description.

feet gutter to gutter width unless on-street parallel parking is proposed. Collector
streets may be 30 feet in width unless on-street parallel parking is proposed.
(5) Parking.
Parking must meet the requirements of the Parking and Loading Requirements
Article plus the following:
For residential lots in excess of 40 feet in width, individual driveways leading to
rear attached or detached parking may be provided. For lots 40 feet or less in
width, parking may be provided via a shared driveway to the rear yard or via an
alley serving rear facing garages or pads. On-street parallel parking may be
permitted with a street configuration acceptable to the Street Superintendent.
Unless physically impossible, all parking for OSD developments shall be located
on the street, to the rear, a mixture of side and rear, or underground.
(6) Utilities.
All utility lines in an OSD project shall be placed underground except that
adaptive reuse developments may have this provision waived upon a finding by
the Building Official, in conjunction with a representative of Newnan Utilities,
that such requirement would require the replacement or relocation of existing
lines at a cost prohibitive to the economic rehabilitation of the building or site.
The developer or subdivider shall ensure final and proper completion and
installation of utility lines as provided in the subdivision regulations.
Standards for street lighting shall be provided by the developer in accordance

Sec. 6-36. - General Development Standards (OSD-2).
(a) Determination of Residential Density.
(1) Yield Plan.
Applicants for OSD districts shall determine the standard permitted density according
to the underlying zoning district through the use of a Yield Plan. Such Yield Plans
consist of conventional lot and street layouts, and must conform to the City's
regulations governing lot dimensions, land suitable for development (for example,
not including wetlands or floodplains), street design, and parking. Although such
plans shall be conceptual in nature, and are not intended to involve significant
engineering costs, they must be realistic, and not show potential house sites or
streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional
layout.
(2) Mapping of Primary Conservation Areas (PCA).
In order to prepare a realistic Yield Plan, applicants need to first map the Primary
Conservation Areas on their site. Typical Yield Plans would include, at minimum, basic
topography at 5-feet intervals, location of wetlands, 100-year floodplains, slopes
exceeding 20%, watershed buffers and setbacks, and soils unsuitable for
development, as indicated on the medium-intensity maps contained in the Coweta
County soil survey published by the USDA Soil Conservation Service.
(b) Density Bonuses.
(1) Density Bonus to Endow Maintenance Fund.
The City may allow up to a 10% density bonus to generate additional income to
the applicant for the sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset
continuing costs of maintaining the undivided open space (mowing meadows or
lawns, woodland vine control, insurance premiums, tax payments, etc.),
including any active or passive recreation facilities. Spending from this fund
should be restricted to expenditure of interest, in order that the principal may
be preserved. Assuming an annual average interest rate of 5%, the amount
designated for the Endowment Fund shall be at least 20 times the estimated
annual maintenance costs. Such estimate shall be prepared by an agency, firm,
or organization with experience in open space management acceptable to the
Planning Commission.
Because additional dwellings over and above the maximum that would
ordinarily be permitted on the site, may reasonably be considered to be net of
development costs and represent true profit, 75% of the net selling price of the
endowment lots shall be donated by the applicant to the Open Space
Maintenance Endowment Fund for the preserved lands within the subdivision.
This fund shall be transferred by the developer to the designated entity with
ownership and maintenance responsibilities (such as a homeowners'
Sec. 6-36. - General Development Standards (OSD-2).
6-55
association, a land trust, or the City), at the time this designated entity is
created.
When estimating the projected maintenance costs of the undivided open space,
it is not necessary to include land that is not accessible by the subdivision
residents for their common enjoyment. In such cases, the density bonus shall
be adjusted proportionately to reflect the acreage that is accessible to residents
for their passive or active recreation, and not being used for other uses by
another party.
(2) Density Bonus for Public Access.
Applicants for new residential developments involving 10 or more dwelling units
shall be required to set aside 5,000 square feet of land for each proposed new
dwelling unit, as undivided recreational land designated for public usage. Such
land shall be suitable for active and/or passive recreation, with at least half the
land suitable for active sports, where such facilities are required by the City. In
lieu of a set-aside for public usage, two alternatives exist for the applicant
proposing subdivision involving 10 or more dwellings:
1. The applicant may offer a set-aside limited to recreational usage by the
residents of the proposed subdivision. If land is set aside in this manner for
private recreational use, it shall also be permanently protected through a
conservation easement enforceable by the City and/or a land trust,
prohibiting future non-recreational (or commercial recreational) uses.
2. The applicant may offer to pay a fee to the City in lieu of any recreational
land set aside. Situations in which it would be appropriate for the City to
accept such offers include cases where the land would not provide a
particular public benefit because of its small size or location. Exceptions to
this rule, where public use of relatively small land areas would still be
appropriate, include situations in which the land could be used to buffer or
extend public parks or public school grounds, or could provide potential
linkage in a future City trail network. The decision whether to accept a
fee-in-lieu offer by the applicant shall lie with the Planning Commission,
which shall also establish the amount of the fee in lieu, based upon the
City's estimated cost of acquiring land that is similar in area and attributes,
which would better serve public recreational needs. In appraising
alternative sites, the City shall be guided by the site selection criteria
contained in its Open Space Plan. Such estimates shall be based on
discussions with realtors or appraisers familiar with land values in the City.
All such fees collected shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account
earmarked for recreational land or facility provision by the City, and the
applicant shall be informed of the use to which the fee will be put.
Sec. 6-36. - General Development Standards (OSD-2).
6-56
In Open Space Developments with fewer than 10 dwelling units, where there
would be no particular benefit accruing from a public dedication (as described
above), the recreational land that is part of the 50% or 60% requirement for
undivided open space shall be designated for private shared recreational usage
among the Subdivision lot owners.
(3) Density Bonus for Meeting Additional Recommended Criteria.
As further developed Sec. 6-36(d), there are six required criteria that must be met for
an open space development. In addition, four of eight recommended criteria must
be met. For developments that meet more than the required four recommended
criteria, an additional 2% density bonus shall be granted for each additional criteria
met.
(4) Density Bonus for Open Space Provision.
The core concept of this development type is the density bonus granted for the
dedication of open space which shall be applicable to all lands not dedicated as open
space. Each open space type has a specific density bonus or allowance. See Sec. 6-
36(c) for additional information.
(c) Type and Location of Dedicated Open Space.
Open space shall be comprised of two types of land: primary and secondary conservation
areas. All lands within these conservation areas are required to be protected by a
permanent conservation easement prohibiting further development and setting other
standards safe-guarding the site's special resources from negative or incompatible change.
The location of open space conserved through this method of development shall be
consistent with the policies contained in the Open Space and Recreation Element of the
Comprehensive Plan, and with the recommendations contained in Designing Open Space
Subdivisions: A Practical Step-by-Step Approach by Randall Arendt. The type of land that
shall be designated as permanent open space, not to be further subdivided, and protected
through a conservation easement recorded and held by the City or by a recognized land
trust or conservancy, shall be as specified below:
(1) Open Space In Primary Conservation Area.
Open space in the Primary Conservation Area (PCA) is determined by deducting
the following kinds of unbuildable land (which are also required to be deducted
when calculating net permitted density for conventional subdivisions as well):
1. Wetlands (as shown on the Official Wetlands Map published by the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources).
2. All floodway and floodway fringe areas within 100-year floodplain, as
shown on official FEMA maps.
3. Land with slopes exceeding 20%, or soils unsuitable for building.
Sec. 6-36. - General Development Standards (OSD-2).
6-57
4. Land under permanent easement prohibiting future development
(including easements for drainage, access, and utilities).
5. All lands located within a watershed protective buffer that are within the
100-year floodplain, are classified as wetlands, or have a slope exceeding
20%.
6. A density credit of 50% shall be awarded for all lands included within this
classification.
These environmentally sensitive resources listed above form the core of the
open space that is required to be protected. The purpose of assigning the above
referenced density to PCA land is for the valid public purpose of protecting
environmentally sensitive lands and resources, including watershed buffer and
setback areas, from the negative effects of development.
(2) Open Space in Secondary Conservation Area.
Secondary Conservation Areas (SCA) shall be those otherwise buildable areas
that have natural or historic features deemed worthy of protection. Secondary
open space typically includes all or part of the following types of resources:
mature stands of native hardwoods or pines, mixed woodlands, open fields or
pastures, significant views or vistas, historic sites or structures, cultural sites or
features, and centrally or strategically located open spaces well-suited for a
green or park.
A one and one-quarter (1¼) credit or 125% density bonus shall be awarded for
all lands included within this classification.
SCA lands are essentially buildable lands that, due to their location in proximity
to sensitive water supply sources, require protection through a prohibition of
development. The purpose of assigning the above referenced density to SCA
land is for the valid public purpose of protecting environmentally sensitive lands
and resources from the negative effects of development.
(3) Restriction on Further Subdivision.
All undivided open space and any lot capable of further subdivision shall be restricted
from further subdivision through a permanent conservation easement, in a form
acceptable to the City and duly recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior
Court of Coweta County.
(4) Distribution of Designated Open Space.
At least 25% of the minimum required open space shall be suitable for active and
passive recreation purposes including golf courses, and no more than 50% shall be
utilized for that purpose, in order to preserve a reasonable proportion of natural
areas on the site. The purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be
documented by the applicant.
Sec. 6-36. - General Development Standards (OSD-2).
6-58
(5) General Locational Standards.
Subdivisions shall be designed around the primary or secondary conservation
areas, which together constitute the total required open space. The design
process should therefore commence with the delineation of all potential open
space, after which potential house sites are located. Following that, access road
alignments are identified, with lot lines being drawn in as the final step. This
process, hereinafter defined as the "four-step design process" is further
described below.
Primary or Secondary Conservation Areas shall be placed in undivided
preserves, which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more
compactly, to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of
the development. Undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the
largest practicable number of lots within an open space development. To
achieve this, the majority of house lots should abut undivided open space in
order to provide direct views and access. Safe and convenient pedestrian access
to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided
(except in the case of resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human
disturbance). Where the undivided open space is designated as separate,
non-contiguous parcels, no parcel shall consist of less than 20,000 square feet in
area nor have a length-to-width ratio in excess of 4:1, except such areas that are
specifically designed as village greens, ballfields, upland buffers to wetlands,
waterbodies or watercourses, or designed as trail links.
(6) Interconnected Open Space Network.
As these policies are implemented, the protected open space in each new subdivision
is envisioned to eventually adjoin each other, ultimately forming an inter-connected
network of primary and secondary conservation areas across the City. To assure that
there will be no taking of land without compensation, the only elements of this
network that would necessarily be open to the public are those lands that have been
required to be dedicated for public use, typically configured in a linear fashion as an
element of the City's long-range open space network. As an incentive to applicants
to connect open space in a proposed development to similarly designated open
space in an adjacent existing or proposed development, a 2-unit density bonus may
be awarded for each external linkage provided that the applicant indicate on the
Sketch Plan where the linkage will occur.
(d) Open Space Evaluation Criteria.
In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will be considered by
the Planning Commission as indicating a design appropriate to the site's natural, historic,
and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of this Section. Diversity and originality in
lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between
Sec. 6-36. - General Development Standards (OSD-2).
6-59
development and conservation areas. Accordingly, the Planning Commission shall evaluate
proposals to determine whether the proposed Sketch Plan accomplishes the following:
(1) Required Criteria.
Applicants must meet all six required criteria below:
Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, watershed undisturbed buffers
and building setbacks (as applicable), areas of poor or rocky soils, and steep
slopes from clearing, grading, filling, or construction (except as may be
approved by the City for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation
amenities).
Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at
least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including
creeks, streams, springs, lakes, and ponds.
Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of
special concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations offering convenient
access by residents, and adequately screened from nearby house lots
(Mandatory for developments larger than 10 acres).
Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can
walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or special
features within the neighborhood open space system. All roadside sidewalks,
footpaths, or multiuse paths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn
should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with
existing space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable).
Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous and whose configuration is in
accordance with the guidelines contained in the Design and Management
Handbook for Preservation Areas, produced by the Natural Lands Trust. For
example, fragmentation of open space shall be minimized so that these
resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various
parts of the development unless no significant natural features were extant to
begin with. To the greatest extent practicable, this land shall be designed as a
single block with logical, straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of
conservation land shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or
unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails.
The open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on
adjacent parcels, and shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and
integrated greenway systems.
(2) Recommended Criteria.
Sec. 6-36. - General Development Standards (OSD-2).
6-60
Applicants must meet at least four of eight recommended criteria below. For each of
the recommended criteria met over the four minimum, an additional 2%, per Sec. 6-
36(b)(3), will be granted.
Preserves and maintains mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures, meadows,
and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between
residential and agricultural uses. For example, locating house lots and driveways
within wooded areas is generally recommended, with two exceptions. The first
involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands which raise an equal or
greater preservation concern. The second involves predominantly agricultural
areas, where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife
habitat.
If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater
constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited on the least
prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far or distant edge of a field or
foreground meadow, as seen from existing public roads. Homes should face
such a field, not back into it, so that the view from a public road is not of the
rear of the home. Other considerations include whether the development will
be visually buffered from existing public roads, such as by a planting screen
consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs and wildflowers.
Designs around existing hedgerows and tree lines between fields or meadows.
Minimizes impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres), especially those
containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat, or those not
degraded by invasive vines. Also, woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils
with slopes greater than 10% should not be disturbed. However, woodlands in
poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable
locations for residential development. Stands of hardwoods and mature
Long-Leaf Pine trees should be preserved while Slash or Loblolly Pines should be
considered worthy of preservation only where the site is devoid of other
significant tree stands. When any woodland is developed, great care shall be
taken to design all disturbed areas (for buildings, roads, yards, etc.) in locations
where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent
that is practicable.
Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen
from public roadways. (For example, in open agricultural landscapes, a deep
'no-build, no-cut' buffer is recommended along the public roadway where those
views or vistas are prominent or locally significant. In wooded areas where the
sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a deep no-build,
no-cut buffer should be respected to preserve existing vegetation.
Avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking
advantage of lower topographic features.
Sec. 6-37. - Specific Development Standards (OSD-2).
6-61
Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological or cultural value,
and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature,
including stone walls, historic homes or buildings, historic districts, spring
houses, barn foundations, cellar holes, burial grounds, civil war sites, etc.
Protects roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying
capacity by avoiding development fronting onto existing public roads.
Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of roads and streets with
historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerows, etc.
Landscaped common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac islands, and
both sides of new streets with native species shade trees and flowering shrubs
with high wildlife conservation value.
(e) Dimensional Requirements.
The dimensional requirements provided in Table 6-D relating to lot area, lot width,
required yards, bulk, building height, and minimum standards relating to landscaping and
open space shall be met before any permits will be issued. When these requirements
conflict with other requirements above, the more restrictive shall apply.
Sec. 6-37. - Specific Development Standards (OSD-2).
(1) OSD-2, Urban Open Space Design District.
The Urban Open Space Design option is intended to cluster residences in a small
grouping or several small groupings similar to neighborhoods that have historically
been a part of Southeastern small town life. Such clustered development is intended
to soften dense development by providing significant common open space and
parklands. Such clustered development is intended to permit the compact grouping
of homes located so as to blend with the existing landscape-such as the rise and fall
of the topography, beelines, and wooded areas-and to preserve to a greater extent
the agricultural, forest, and visual character of the landscape. Specific standards for
this open space development option are as follows:
Sidewalks shall be provided according to The "Sidewalk Requirements"
Ordinance within the City of Newnan Code of Ordinances and are required for
all OSD-2 developments.
No fewer than 10 nor more than 50 lots may be grouped together in a specific
cluster.
Clusters may be no closer than 100 feet from each other measured lot line to lot
line except that the maximum distance between building areas of cluster lots
facing across a green or square is 350 feet.
A minimum 5-foot wide and maximum 8-foot wide tree lawn is required
between the required sidewalk and the curb. The tree lawn shall be planted
Sec. 6-38. - General Site Planning Standards and Procedures (OSD-2).
6-62
with shade trees and additionally landscaped in a manner consistent with the
landscaping standards as specified in the "Tree Preservation and Landscaping"
Ordinance within the City Code of Ordinances.
Dwellings erected in an OSD-2 Development shall have either a full or partial
(minimum 33% of facade) front porch. Garages shall be rear entry or rear
yard/front entry or may be detached and located in the rear yard. Alleys are
permitted and encouraged to serve garages in the rear of the lots.
Dwellings, guest houses, garages and other such structures shall not trespass
into minimum side yards. However, detached garages located at the rear of a lot
(i.e., behind the rear building line) and attached to a similar garage on a
contiguous lot may be located within the side yard setback provided that a fire
wall separate the individual garage spaces.
A landscaped green or square is required for any OSD-2 Development of greater
than 7 dwellings. This green or square may be included in secondary open space
calculations. Greens or squares shall meet the following minimum criteria:
1. The maximum length:width ratio of such a green shall be 4:1.
2. Greens or squares shall have a minimum size of 10,000 square feet and are
recommended to be between 7,500 and 40,000 square feet in area.
3. The use of multiple greens and/or squares is encouraged. A standard of
one green or square per 25 to 30 residences is recommended.
Advisory Design Standards.
The City of Newnan recognizes that every OSD-2 design will be a custom
response to the unique assets and constraints of each tract. As a consequence,
the City has only incorporated within the OSD regulations those siting and
design rules required to preserve open space, allow the clustering of dwellings,
and create a neighborhood atmosphere. However, the City does wish to
encourage design consistent with the City of Newnan's past and appends the
following general design guidelines for OSD-2 designers.

Table 6-E: Determination of Density and Parcel Size
The Total Parcel Size (TPS) is established and conventional
density of underlying zoning is noted:
TPS = 100 acres
Density: 2.9 units/acre x 100 acres = 290 units
Conventional Lot Size = 15,000 square feet
Conventional Yield (CY) = 290 units
Maintenance Fund Density Bonus = 290 * 0.12 = 35 units
Public Access Density Bonus = 290 * 0.15 = 44 units
Recommended Criteria Bonus = 290 * 0.08 = 23 units
Modified Conventional Yield (MCY) = 290 + 35 + 44 + 23 =
392 units
Modified Density: 3.92 units/acre
Adjusted Conventional Yield (ACY) is determined by
multiplying the PBA by the Modified Density:
PBA * 3.92 units/acre = ACY
60 * 3.92 = 235
The Primary Conservation Area (PCA) is determined as
follows:
PCA = 4.0 acres of wetlands + 6.0 acres of steep slopes
PCA = 10 acres
A 50% density bonus is awarded for PCA set asides:
(10 * 0.50) * 3.92 units/acre = 19.6 or 20 unit bonus
Gross Total Buildable Area (GTBA) is derived by subtracting
PCA from TPS:
TPS  PCA = GTBA
100  10 = 90
A 125% density bonus is awarded for SCA set asides:
(21.0 * 1.25) * 3.92 units/acre = 102.9 or 103 unit bonus
The Paved Area (PA) is subtracted from the GTBA figure to
account for infrastructure requirements resulting in Net
Total Buildable Area (NTBA):
GTBA  PA = NTBA
90  9 = 81
Final Permitted Yield (FPY) is determined by adjusting the
density for the ACY based on allotted conservation
bonuses and dividing by the underlying minimum lot size:
ACY + PCA Bonus + SCA Bonus = FPY
235 + 20 + 103 = 358 units
Sec. 6-38. - General Site Planning Standards and Procedures (OSD-2).
6-64
Table 6-E: Determination of Density and Parcel Size
The Secondary Conservation Area (SCA) is determined as
follows:
SCA = 21 acre meadow and woodland copse
Permitted Lot Size (PLS) is determined by dividing FPY by
PBA:
FPY/PBA = 5.68 units/acre
358/60 = 5.97 units/acre
43,560/5.97 = 7297 square feet
Permitted Building Area (PBA) is determined by subtracting
SCA from NTBA:
NTBA  SCA = PBA
81  21 = 60
Total Built Area = 67 acres
Total Open Space = 33 acres
Conventional Yield = 290 units
Adjusted Permitted Yield = 358 units
Additional units under OSD = 68 units
Note: The sum of PCA and SCA must be at least 50% of PBA.
(b) Elements of the Preliminary Plan Process.
The elements of the preliminary plan process are as described below. It is strongly
recommended that applicants retain the services of a licensed landscape architect (ASLA)
who is familiar with open space planning concepts. This can significantly reduce the review
and revision time often needed for this type of development.
(1) Pre-Application Discussion.
A pre-application discussion is required between the applicant, the site designer(s),
and the Development Review Committee (DRC). The purpose of this informal
meeting is to introduce the applicant and the site designer(s) to the City's zoning and
subdivision regulations and procedures, and to discuss the applicant's objectives in
relation to the City's official policies and ordinance requirements. The City may
designate a consultant experienced in open space development design and in the
protection of natural features and greenway lands to meet with the applicant, and to
attend or conduct meetings required under this ordinance. (The cost of these
consultant services shall be paid for through subdivision review fees received by the
City.)
(2) Existing Site Features Plan.
Existing site features plans analyzing each site's special features are required for all
proposed subdivisions, as they form the basis of the design process for greenway
lands, house locations, street alignments, and lot lines. The applicant or
representative shall bring a copy of the Existing Site Features Plan to the on-site field
survey. Existing Site Features Plans shall be provided on a 24 x 36 plat and must
include at a minimum:
A contour map based at least upon topographical maps published by the U.S.
Geological Survey.
Sec. 6-38. - General Site Planning Standards and Procedures (OSD-2).
6-65
The location of severely constraining elements such as steep slopes (over 20%),
wetlands, watercourses, intermittent streams and 100-year floodplains,
watershed protective buffers, watershed building setbacks, and all rights-of-way
and easements; soil boundaries as shown on USDA Soil Conservation Service
medium-intensity maps; and the location of significant features such as
woodlands, tree lines, open fields or meadows, scenic views into or out from
the property, watershed divides and drainage ways, fences or stone walls, rock
outcrops, and existing structures, roads, tracks and trails.
The Existing Site Features Plans shall identify primary conservation areas and
secondary conservation areas, as described above. Together, these conservation
areas comprise the development's proposed open space, the location of which
shall be consistent with the locational design criteria listed in the
Comprehensive Plan. The Existing Site Features Plan shall form the basis for the
Sketch Plan, which shall show the tentative location of houses, streets, lot lines
and greenway lands in new subdivisions, according to the four-step design
process described in Sec. 6-38(b)(6).
(3) On-Site Field Survey.
After the Existing Site Features Plan has been prepared, the Development Review
Committee (DRC) shall schedule a mutually convenient date to walk the property
with the applicant and his/her site designer. The purpose of this visit is to familiarize
City officials with the property's special features, and to provide them an informal
opportunity to offer guidance (or at least a response) to the applicant regarding the
tentative location of the secondary conservation areas and potential house locations
and street alignments. If this visit is not scheduled before submittal of the sketch or
the Sketch Plan, it should occur soon thereafter.
(4) Pre-Submittal Conference.
Prior to the submittal of the Sketch Plan, the applicant shall meet with the
Development Review Committee (DRC) to discuss how the four-step approach to
designing subdivisions, described in Sec. 6-38(b)(6), could be applied to the subject
property. At the discretion of the DRC, this conference may be combined with the
On-Site Field Survey.
(5) Sketch Plan, General Requirements.
As used in this Ordinance, the term "Sketch Plan" refers to a preliminarily engineered
plan drawn to illustrate initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for greenway
lands, house sites, and street alignments. This is the stage where drawings are
tentatively illustrated prior to any significant expenditure on engineering costs in the
detailed design of streets, stormwater management systems, or the accurate
delineation of internal lot boundaries.
Sec. 6-38. - General Site Planning Standards and Procedures (OSD-2).
6-66
After the pre-submittal conference, a Sketch Plan on a 24 x 36 plat shall be
submitted by the applicant to the Planning Department who will then submit it
to the Development Review Committee (DRC) for review for the purpose of
securing early agreement on the overall pattern of streets, house lots, primary
and secondary conservation areas, and potential trail linkages (where
applicable).
It is highly recommended that the Sketch Plan be prepared by either an ASLA
certified landscape architect, a physical or site planner experienced in designing
open space subdivisions, or a design team that includes such professionals.
(6) Sketch Plan, Four-Step Process.
Each Sketch Plan shall follow a four-step design process, as described below. When
the Sketch Plan is submitted, applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the
Planning Commission that these four design steps were followed by their site
designers in determining the layout of their proposed streets, house lots, and
greenway lands. This process shall be accomplished during the 15 days of the
designated 45-day review period for Preliminary Plans.
Designating the Open Space.
During the first step, all potential conservation areas (primary) are identified,
using the Existing Site Features Plan. Guidance on which parts of the remaining
land to classify as secondary conservation areas shall be based upon:
1. The procedures described in Designing Open Space Subdivisions, produced
by the Natural Lands Trust,
2. On-site visits or field surveys,
3. The open space locational criteria contained above,
4. The evaluation criteria listed in above,
5. Information from published data and reports, and
6. Conversations with existing or recent owners of the property, members of
the Planning Commission and the Development Review Committee (DRC).
Location of House Sites.
During the second step, potential house sites are tentatively located.
1. Because the proposed location of houses within each lot represents a
significant decision with potential impacts on the ability of the
development to meet the 14 evaluation criteria contained above,
subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the Sketch
Plan and proposed house sites on the detailed Final Plan.
2. House sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from
Primary Conservation Areas, but may be situated within 50 feet of
Sec. 6-38. - General Site Planning Standards and Procedures (OSD-2).
6-67
Secondary Conservation Areas, in order to enjoy views of the latter
without negatively impacting the former.
3. The building footprint of proposed residences may be changed by more
than 50 feet in any direction with majority approval from the members of
the Planning Commission. Changes involving less than 50 feet do not
require approval.
Street and Lot Layout.
The third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access
to each house in the most reasonable and efficient manner.
1. When lots and access streets are laid out, they shall be located in a way
that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on both the Primary and
Secondary Conservation Areas.
2. To the greatest extent practicable, wetland or stream crossings and streets
traversing existing slopes over 15% are strongly discouraged.
3. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number
of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the City and to facilitate easy
access to and from homes in different parts of the property (and on
adjoining parcels). Where cul-de-sacs are necessary, those serving 6 or
fewer homes may be designed with hammerheads facilitating
three-point turns. Cul-de-sacs serving more than 6 homes shall generally
be designed with a central island containing indigenous trees and shrubs
(either conserved on site, or planted). The City generally encourages the
creation of single-loaded residential access streets, in order that the
maximum number of homes in new developments may enjoy views of
open space. Please note that the method of subdivision layout required in
this Section differs from conventional subdivision layout in that street
position is only considered when open space and home site have been
determined.
Lot Lines.
The fourth step is simply to draw in the lot lines (where applicable).
(7) Engineering Certification.
Prior to approval of the Sketch Plan, the applicant shall submit to the DRC a
Preliminary Engineering Certification that the approximate layout of proposed
streets, house-lots, and open space lands complies with the City's zoning and
subdivision ordinances, particularly those sections governing the design of
subdivision streets and stormwater management facilities. This certification
requirement is meant to provide the City with assurance that the proposed plan is
able to be accomplished within the current regulations of the City. The certification
shall also note any waivers needed to implement the plan as drawn.
Sec. 6-39. - Guidelines for Ownership and Maintenance of Open Space & Other Common Elements (OSD-2).
6-68
(8) Preliminary Plan Submittal.
Should the Sketch Plan be found acceptable to the DRC, a Preliminary Plan submitted
on a 24 x 36 plat shall be submitted to the Planning Commission along with the
application for consideration of rezoning for OSD-2 designation. The Preliminary Plan
shall, in effect, serve as a preliminary subdivision plat submittal and shall meet all
requirements for a preliminary subdivision plat as prescribed by the City of Newnan
Subdivision Ordinance. Acceptance of the preliminary plan by the Planning
Commission shall constitute rezoning to an OSD-2 overlay upon City Council
approval.
(c) Final Plan Submittal.
When all of the conditions of the Preliminary Plan have been met and determined
complete by the Planning Commission, the applicant is eligible to submit a Final Plan. A
Final Plan, which shall be considered a final subdivision plat, shall meet all of the
requirements for a final subdivision plat as prescribed by the City of Newnan Subdivision
Ordinance. If approved, the Final Plan shall also serve as an approved final subdivision
plat.
Sec. 6-39. - Guidelines for Ownership and Maintenance of Open Space & Other Common
Elements (OSD-2).
(a) General Guidelines.
Different ownership and management options apply to the permanently protected open
space created through the development process. The open space shall remain undivided
and may be owned and managed by the required Homeowners Association (HOA), the
City, or a recognized land trust or conservancy. A public land dedication, not exceeding
10% of the total parcel size, may be required by the City, through this open space, to
facilitate trail connections. A narrative describing ownership, use and maintenance
responsibilities shall be submitted for all common and public improvements, utilities and
open spaces. All common elements apart from the required open space must be owned
and managed by the Homeowners Association (HOA).
(b) Ownership Standards.
Common open space within a development shall be owned, administered and maintained
by any of the following methods, either individually or in combination, and subject to
approval by the City.
(1) Offer of Dedication.
The City shall have the first and last offer of dedication of undivided open space in
the event said land is to be conveyed. Dedication shall take the form of a fee simple
ownership. The City may, but shall not be required, to accept undivided open space
provided:
Sec. 6-39. - Guidelines for Ownership and Maintenance of Open Space & Other Common Elements (OSD-2).
6-69
Such land is accessible to the residents of the City;
There is no cost of acquisition other than any costs incidental to the transfer of
ownership such as title insurance; and
The City agrees to and has access to maintain such lands. Where the City
accepts dedication of common open space that contains improvements, the City
may require the posting of surety to ensure structural integrity of said
improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements for a term not to
exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. The amount of
surety shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of said
improvements.
(2) Homeowners Association.
The undivided open space and associated facilities may be held in common
ownership by a Homeowners Association (HOA), hereinafter referred to as "the
association". The association shall be formed and operated under the following
provisions:
The developer shall provide a description of the association including its bylaws
and methods for maintaining the open space.
The association shall be organized by the developer and be operated with
financial subsidization by the developer, before the sale of any lots within the
development.
Membership in the association is automatic (required) for all purchasers of
homes therein and their successors. The conditions and timing of transferring
control of the association from developer to homeowners shall be identified.
The association shall be responsible for maintenance, insurance, and taxes on
undivided open space, enforceable by liens placed by the City.
The members of the association shall share equitably the costs of maintaining
and developing such undivided open space. Shares shall be defined within the
association bylaws.
In the event of a proposed transfer, within the methods here permitted, of
undivided open space land by the homeowners association, or of the
assumption of maintenance of undivided open space land by the City, notice of
such action shall be given to all property owners within the development.
The association shall have or hire adequate staff to administer common facilities
and properly and continually maintain the undivided open space.
The HOA may lease open space lands to any other qualified person, or
corporation, for operation and maintenance of open space lands, but such a
lease agreement shall provide:
Sec. 6-39. - Guidelines for Ownership and Maintenance of Open Space & Other Common Elements (OSD-2).
6-70
1. The residents of the development shall at all times have access to the open
space lands contained therein.
2. The undivided open space to be leased shall be maintained for the
purposes set forth in this Ordinance.
3. The operation of open space facilities may be for the benefit of the
residents only, or may be open to the residents of the City, at the election
of the developer and/or homeowners association, as the case may be.
4. Lease agreements so entered upon shall be recorded with the County Clerk
of the Superior Court within 30 days of their execution and a copy of the
recorded lease shall be filed with the City.
(3) Condominiums.
The undivided open space and associated facilities may be controlled through the use
of condominium agreements, approved by the City. Such agreements shall be in
conformance with the state's uniform condominium act. All undivided open space
land shall be held as a common element.
(4) Dedication of Easements.
The City may, but shall not be required, to accept easements for public use of any
portion or portions of undivided open space land, title of which is to remain in
ownership by condominium or HOA, provided:
Such land is accessible to City residents;
There is no cost of acquisition other than any costs incidental to the transfer of
ownership, such as title insurance; and
A satisfactory maintenance agreement is reached between the developer,
condominium, or HOA and the City.
(5) Transfer of Easements to a Private Conservation Organization.
With the permission of the City, an owner may transfer easements to a private,
non-profit organization, among whose purpose it is to conserve open space and/or
natural resources, provided that:
The organization is a bona fide conservation organization with perpetual
existence;
The conveyance contains appropriate provision for proper re-conveyance or retransfer
in event that organization becomes unwilling or unable to continue
carrying out its functions;
A maintenance agreement acceptable to the HOA is entered into by the
developer and the organization; and
Sec. 6-39. - Guidelines for Ownership and Maintenance of Open Space & Other Common Elements (OSD-2).
6-71
Maintenance agreements so entered upon shall be recorded with County Clerk
of the Superior Court within 30 days of its execution and a copy of the recorded
agreement shall be filed with the City.
(c) Maintenance Standards.
(1) The ultimate owner of the open space (typically a Homeowners Association) shall be
responsible for raising all monies required for operations, maintenance or physical
improvements to the open space through annual dues, special assessments, etc.
(2) In the event that the association or any successor organization shall, at any time after
establishment of a development containing undivided open space, fail to maintain
the undivided open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the City through the Planning and Zoning Director may serve
written notice upon the owner of record, setting forth the manner in which the
owner of record has failed to maintain the undivided open space in reasonable
condition.
(3) Failure to adequately maintain the undivided open space in reasonable order and
condition constitutes a violation of this Ordinance. The Planning and Zoning Director
is hereby authorized to give notice, by personal service or by United States mail, to
the owner or occupant, as the case may be, of any violation, directing the owner to
remedy the same within 20 days.
(4) Should any bill or bills for maintenance of undivided open space by the City be
unpaid by November 1st of each year, a late fee of 15% shall be added to such bills
and a lien shall be filed against the premises in the same manner as other City claims.
(d) Other Elements.
(1) Each OSD district comprising common development elements shall have an
incorporated HOA or Business Association (BA) which shall have the right and
responsibility to maintain the following areas and improvements:
Common open space
Private roads, if any, within or serving the development
Any stormwater management ponds or areas
Fire protection pond, dry mains, or other improvements
Other common facilities or improvements as may be designated in the adopted
bylaws
(2) The Association's documents shall be submitted as part of the initial record plat
application and shall provide for adequate initial funding and assessments to fund
the maintenance of common property and improvements.
Sec. 6-42. - Planned Development Park Standards.
6-72
Sec. 6-40. - Modification of Regulations (OSD-2).
(a) Conflicts.
Where there are conflicts between the OSD provisions herein and the general zoning,
subdivision or other regulations and requirements, the OSD regulations shall apply.
(b) Modifications.
(1) The City Council may allow reasonable modifications to other applicable regulations
as follows:
These other regulations serve public purposes to a lesser degree than the OSD.
The designs or solutions proposed by the applicant, although not literally in
accord with these other regulations, satisfy public purposes to a greater degree.
The strict implementation of these other regulations would prevent well
designed OSD development.
(2) Such modifications may be granted by the City Council by special exception only.
Such modifications may be sought prior to filing the Sketch Plan. The landowner shall
include the Sketch Plan of the proposed OSD development as part of the application
for modification and shall demonstrate the reasons for the request.

are met.
Sec. 7-6. - Restrictions on Use of Off-Street Parking.
(a) Dedicated parking spaces shall be used for the parking of motor vehicles only unless
otherwise specified in this Ordinance.
(b) The storage of merchandise or materials, or the repair of motor vehicles, or any kind of
equipment, except for the temporary storage of construction material and equipment while
work is taking place on the structure where the off-street parking is located, is prohibited in
all off-street parking spaces, including required and non-required spaces.
(c) Areas designated for temporary occupancy of vehicles while maneuvering on a site, such as
queuing lanes for a drive-in window, are not considered parking spaces.
(d) Every business that stores vehicles owned by the business on site overnight (such as a
company fleet), or maintains a stock of vehicles as part of its business activities (such as a
car sales lot, car rental agency, etc.), shall provide for adequate parking or storage for the
vehicles such that no parking occurs in a public right-of-way or in an area that has not been
improved as a parking lot or storage yard. Such parking spaces shall be in addition to those
required for employees and customers.
Sec. 7-7. - Shared Parking.
(a) Joint use of up to 50% of required parking spaces may be allowed for two or more uses
located on the same parcel or adjacent parcels, provided that the developer can
demonstrate that the uses will not substantially overlap in hours of operation or in the
demand for shared spaces. Proof of claim for non-overlap by the developer shall be
substantiated by a report by a certified parking consultant which shall provide, at a
minimum:
(1) Number of spaces anticipated to be used by each shared use. Numbers provided shall
be verifiable via data provided by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), Urban
Land Institute (ULI), American Planning Association (APA), or National Parking
Association (NPA).

7-8
(2) Anticipated distribution of parking utilization by each shared use by hour of operation
over a 24-hour period and over a 7-day week.
(3) A short narrative describing the anticipated dynamics of the shared parking scenario.
(b) Any sharing of required parking spaces by uses located on different parcels shall be
guaranteed by a legally binding written agreement between the owner of the parking area
and the owner of any use located on a different parcel and served by the parking area. The
agreement shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with this Sec. 7-7 and filed with
the City of Newnan Planning and Zoning Department.
Sec. 7-8. - Location of Off-Street Parking.
(a) Required off-street parking shall be located on the same lot as the building to be served
unless otherwise provided by Sec. 7-9 below.
(1) Parking spaces shall be located no more than 400 feet from the use they are intended
to serve. This standard does not apply to auditoriums, stadiums, assembly halls,
gymnasiums, and other places of assembly; industrial uses; and hospitals.
(2) An off-street parking space shall be located:
a. Off the public right-of-way;
b. So that it will not be necessary for a vehicle, when exiting from the space, to back
into a major street or any other street intersection considered hazardous because
of inadequate site distance or heavy traffic; and
c. So that it is accessible by a driveway meeting the requirements between the
space and the public street.
(3) For detached single-family dwellings and for each side of a duplex dwelling, a driveway
may serve as off-street parking space, provided that the portion of the driveway used
for parking is off the public right-of-way.
(4) In commercial districts, parking and loading spaces shall be allowed in areas between
buildings and such agricultural districts, existing or planned residential districts, or land
bays allowing residential uses and shall be screened where such uses are visible from
the said agricultural and residential areas. Such screening requirements are specified
in the Citys Tree Preservation and Landscaping Ordinance.
Sec. 7-9. - Remote Parking Area.
(a) Definition and Purpose.
A remote parking area is an uncovered, ground-level area used to meet the parking needs
of a use allowed in the same district but separate and distinct from the principal lot. A
private remote parking area may be established for the purpose of accommodating required
or overflow parking for a specific use in a manner consistent with the character of the
surrounding properties.
Sec. 7-10. - Design Requirements for Off-Street Parking Spaces.
7-9
(b) Establishment.
A remote parking area may be established to satisfy the parking needs of a use allowed in
the same district only if the space available on the principal lot does not meet the
requirements of Table 7-A or if a reasonable shared parking arrangement cannot be made.
This provision shall not be construed as to allow a reduction in the number of parking spaces
required on the principal lot by this Article.
(c) Location Requirements.
Remote parking areas shall be located within reasonable walking distance of the principal
lot. The parking area shall be located and its entrances and exits so arranged that vehicular
and pedestrian traffic through surrounding residential areas will not be increased over that
caused by existing on-street parking and through traffic.
(d) Yard and Site Requirements.
(1) Setbacks requirements are not applicable as buildings or other structures are not
permitted on the lot.
(2) There are no lot width or area requirements for remote parking areas; except that a
lot shall not be altered in shape or further subdivided in such a manner that either the
minimum requirements of the district are no longer met or any existing nonconformity
is increased in scope.
(e) Screening.
A remote parking area shall be screened from adjacent residentially zoned and/or used
property by a masonry wall or planted buffer strip not less than 6 feet in height. Such
screening shall also be provided along public rights-of-way, except that where necessary to
meet vision clearance requirements, such screening shall be only 3 feet in height. The
height of screening along public rights-of-way shall be measured from either street level or
ground level.
(f) Signs and Lighting.
(1) Signs.
One sign having an area no greater than 1 square foot shall be allowed at each
entrance or exit. One additional sign having an area no greater than 3 square feet shall
be allowed at each entrance. The above signs may be located adjacent to the public
right-of-way but shall not be located within 5 feet of any other property line.
(2) Lighting.
Lighting of remote parking areas shall be adequate to assure the safety and
convenience of persons using the parking area. Lights shall be so shielded and directed
as to prevent glare into surrounding residential areas.

perimeter of parking lots, garages, and other vehicle storage areas except at entrances
and exits indicated on approved parking plans.
(2) These barriers shall be designed and located to prevent parked vehicles from
extending beyond property lines and from hanging over any sidewalk or other
pedestrian path.
(e) Landscaping, Buffers, and Screening.
Landscaping, buffer, and screening requirements for parking areas are provided in the Citys Tree
Preservation and Landscaping Ordinance.

No residence shall have a driveway and parking area with a total area that exceeds 25% of
the front yard in all residential zoned districts, with the exception of PDR districts. For the
purpose of this Section, driveways and parking areas shall include all asphalt, concrete, and
gravel surfaces that are accessible via an approved curb cut and shall not include grassed or
landscaped surfaces.
(b) Vehicles Prohibited in the Front Yard.
No residence shall be allowed to park more than two vehicles in the front yard and outside

becomes deteriorated due to the parking of said vehicles. Additionally, access to the yard
parking shall be through a driveway that is accessible via an approved curb cut. Vehicles
shall not enter the property via a curb, or over a sidewalk.
(c) Recreational Vehicles or Trailers.
(1) No more than three recreational vehicles or trailers may be parked on any single
residential lot, in accordance with the following requirements:

the short-term, temporary parking of delivery trucks, moving vans and similar vehicles
which deliver goods and services and while those services are being actively provided at the
residence.
Sec. 7-12. - Off-Street Parking Plans.
(a) Parking Plans, When Required.
(1) For any parking lot, garage, vehicle storage area operated on a commercial basis,
reconfiguration of an existing parking lot or any other off-street parking area required

Sec. 8-1. - Findings, Purpose and Intent.
The purposes of these sign regulations are: to encourage the effective use of signs as a
means of communication in the city; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the
citys ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; to improve pedestrian and
traffic safety; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private
property; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions. This sign
ordinance is adopted under the zoning authority of the city in furtherance of the more general
purposes set forth in this Ordinance.
(a) Statement of Legislative Purpose.
(1) The City Council recognizes that signs provide an important medium through which
individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. However,
left unregulated, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic
hazard, as a detriment to property values, and as an aesthetic nuisance affecting the
overall economic growth of the city. Numerous professional studies have been
prepared that examine and establish the effect of signs on traffic safety, aesthetics and
economic prosperity, including the following:
a. Klauer, S.G., T.A. Dingus, V.L. Neale, J.D. Sudweeks, D.J. Ramsey. The Impact of
Driver Inattention on Near-Crash/Crash Risk: An Analysis Using the 100-Car
Naturalistic Driving Study Data. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
DOT HS 810 594. April 2006.
b. Snyder, Jonathan, Samuel S. Fels Fund. Beyond Aesthetics: How Billboards Affect
Economic Prosperity. December 2011.
c. Wachtel, J., 2009. Safety Impacts of the Emerging Digital Display Technologies
for Outdoor Advertising Signs. Prepared for AASHTO and the Standing
Committee on Research of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program
(NCHRP), April 2009. The Veridian Group, Inc., Berkeley, California.
d. Weitz, Jerry, Ph.D., AICP. The Public Purpose of Rowell's Sign Ordinance and the
Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper. December 7, 1999.
(2) Based on a review of the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as
other related studies, the City Council finds that unregulated signs:
a. Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians;
b. Can be a detriment to the public health;
c. Can hamper economic growth;
d. Can lower property values;
e. Can adversely impact public investments;
f. Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and
Sec. 8-1. - Findings, Purpose and Intent.
8-3
g. Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding
environment.
(b) Findings of Fact.
Specifically, the Mayor and City Council find that:
(1) Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly, and
safely designed business environment.
(2) An improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the
public.
(3) The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions,
confusion, and visual clutter, caused by the proliferation, improper placement,
illumination and excessive height and size of signs that compete for the attention of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and impede vision of traffic, traffic controls signs, and
devices.
(4) Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may result in a roadside clutter that impedes the flow
of information thereby defeating the purpose of signage, and that impedes the flow of
information from traffic signs and signals thereby creating hazards to drivers and
pedestrians.
(5) Uncontrolled and unlimited signs degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural
and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic
value of tourism, visitation, and permanent economic growth.
(6) Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic wellbeing of the
city of Newnan will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business.
(c) Purpose and Intent.
(1) Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of
noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left unregulated, signs can
become a threat to public safety as well a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute
an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the citys public
welfare. The mayor and council intend by enacting this Article to:
a. Balance the rights of individuals to convey their message through signs and the
right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
b. Further, the objectives of the citys comprehensive plan;
c. Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city;
d. Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
e. Maintain the historical image of the city;
f. Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual
blight caused by signs;
g. Promote economic development; and
Sec. 8-1. - Findings, Purpose and Intent.
8-4
h. Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(2) While specifically establishing regulations to control signs within the city, it is not the
intent of this Article:
a. to regulate art and art symbols; or,
b. holiday decorations and symbols.
(3) Recognizing the need for certain types of signs which facilitate the safe and orderly
movement of traffic, this Article provides for the regulation of incidental address
identification and subdivision identification signs.
(4) Recognizing the need to facilitate decreases in crime this Article provides for the
regulation of burglar alarm/security signs.
(5) Recognizing the historical contribution of certain structures and places to the cultural
fabric of the city and the need and desire to identify same, certain provisions are made
in this Article to allow for the identification of those structures and places.
(6) While this Article prohibits certain signs from placement within the city and exempts
certain signs from certain regulations of this Article, such exemptions are not intended
to otherwise allow a sign that is prohibited.
(7) Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining
landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and the
sustained stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and
deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings, and other
structures throughout the city.
(8) Accordingly, in consideration of the citys rights and obligations to promote traffic
safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of
public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and
industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general
prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes
the regulations contained in this Article.
(d) Intent in Interpretation.
(1) In interpreting the provisions of this Article, nothing shall be construed as intent to
regulate the content of the message displayed on any sign except to address a
compelling public safety or aesthetic concern or to comply with state law.
(2) All signs may display a non-commercial message constituting personal speech in
addition to or in lieu of any other message. It is the intent of this Article to regulate
only the number, type, size, height, timing, appearance, construction materials,
location and portability of signs to accomplish the purposes set forth in Sec. 8-1(c),
above, except as otherwise provided herein.
Sec. 8-3. - Definitions and Interpretation.
8-5
Sec. 8-2. - Applicability and Effect.
(a) A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained in the city only
in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this
Article.
(b) The effect of this Article as more specifically set forth herein, is:
(1) To establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and
industrial zones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards
and the permit procedures of this Article;
(2) To allow certain signs that are small and unobtrusive, subject to the substantive
requirements of this Article, but without a requirement for permits;
(3) To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
(4) To regulate signs so as to prevent the degradation of the aesthetic attractiveness of
the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the
economic value of tourism, visitation, and permanent economic growth;
(5) To prevent the proliferation of signs which may result in roadside clutter that would
impede the flow of information from businesses to consumers thereby harming the
economic health of the community, and that would impede the flow of information
from traffic signs and signal and therefore create hazards to drivers and pedestrians;
(6) To lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the
proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs
that compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic, and impede vision
of traffic, traffic control signs and devises;
(7) To prohibit all signs not expressly allowed by this Article; and
(8) To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this Article.

Sec. 8-4. - Computations.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign face area and sign height.
(a) Computation of Area.
Sec. 8-4. - Computations.
8-19
(1) Generally.
a. The area of a sign face or module shall be computed by means of the smallest
rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation,
emblem, logo, or other display, together with any material or color forming an
integral part of the background of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign
face from the sign body or structure against which the sign face is placed The sign
face area does not include any supporting framework, structural supports, or
decorative structure or wall when such structure or wall is clearly incidental to
the display itself.
b. If a sign face is composed of two or more sign modules, the sign face area shall
be the area of each module, measured in accordance with Sec. 8-4(a)(1)a, totaled
together.
c. The area of a sign structure shall be computed by means of the smallest rectangle
that will encompass the extreme limits of the sign, by multiplying:
1. The width of the body of the sign (exclusive of the signs base or decorative
cap, if any) measured at the widest portion of the sign body; times
2. The height of the sign as determined under Sec. 8-4(b), Computation of
Height.
d. The following are examples of how sign structure area and sign face area
measurements are made; the signs shown are illustrative and only provided for
clarity.
(2) Area of Multi-Sided Signs.
The sign face area for a sign structure with more than one side shall be computed by
adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. The sign face area
Sec. 8-4. - Computations.
8-20
of a sign structure with more than one side, and such sides are not more than 24 inches
apart from any point of the sign, shall be computed as follows:
a. Double-sided signs.
For double-sided signs, when the sign
face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back),
or where the smallest angle formed
between the two sides is 60 degrees or
less, the area of the sign shall be taken as
the area of the largest sign face. For
double-sided signs where the interior
angle formed by the sides is more than 60
degrees, the sign face area shall be the
total area of both faces.
b. Signs with three or more sides.
1. For sign structures having only
three sides and the interior angle
formed between each of the sides is
60 degrees, the sign face area shall
be taken as the area of the largest
of the three sign faces.
2. For all other multi-sided signs with
three or more sides, the sign face
area shall be either the largest sign
face on any one side, or the largest
total of all sign faces that are joined
by an interior angle of more than 60
degrees, whichever can be viewed
from an adjoining street.
(3) Free-Form Signs.
For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes
all of the signs words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors or other design
elements intended to convey the signs message shall establish the area of the sign
face.
(4) Kiosks.
For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be the
largest measurement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements
shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure.
Sign Face Area:
Three-sided Sign Structures
Sec. 8-4. - Computations.
8-21
Free-Form Sign
Kiosk Sign
(b) Computation of Height.
(1) For a freestanding sign structure located within 100 feet of an adjacent street right-ofway
(as measured perpendicular to the street), the following applies:
a. For a sign located on land at or above the crown of the roadway in the adjacent
street, the height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the
sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign.
Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to
construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of
any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating
the sign.
b. For a sign located on land below the crown of the roadway in the adjacent street,
the sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the
normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point
Sec. 8-5. - Restrictions on Changeable Copy Signs.
8-22
of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance
to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is lower.
(2) For a freestanding sign structure located 100 feet or more from an adjacent street
right-of-way (as measured perpendicular to the street), the height of a sign shall be
equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign to the
highest point of any portion of the sign. Any earthen berms or other site improvements
that raise the sign above the pre-construction natural grade of the land upon which
the sign is placed shall be included in the height measurement of the sign.
Sec. 8-5. - Restrictions on Changeable Copy Signs.
(a) Manual Changeable Copy Signs.
A manual changeable copy sign on which the message is changed more than eight times per
day shall be considered an animated sign and not a manual changeable copy sign for
purposes of this Article.
(b) Multiple Message Signs.
(1) Each display surface of a multiple message sign shall remain fixed for at least 10
seconds.
(2) When a display surface is rotated to the next display surface, it shall be accomplished
in three seconds or less.
(3) No such multiple message sign shall be placed within 5,000 feet of another multiple
message sign or a variable message sign on the same side of a street or highway.
(4) The multiple message sign shall contain a default design that will freeze the display
surface in one position if a malfunction occurs.
(c) Variable Message Signs.
(1) Variable message signs shall only be freestanding, monument or highway signs as
defined by this Article.
(2) No variable message sign shall be placed within 5,000 feet of another variable message
sign or a multiple message sign on the same side of a street or highway.
(3) The message shall remain fixed for at least 10 seconds and when a message is changed,
it shall be perceived as Instantaneous within the capability of the technology employed
(generally about 1/10th of a second).
(4) Any sign that utilizes lighting to simulate or gives an illusion of movement, or utilizes
frame effects, flashing or bursting illuminations, scrolling, or other variation in the
static image during the display of a single image is not allowed and shall be considered
an animated sign.
(5) No variable message sign shall exceed one half (0.5) maintained foot-candles above
ambient light levels measured at any adjacent property line to a residentially zoned lot
and shall not exceed 2.0 maintained foot-candles above ambient light levels at any
Sec. 8-6. - Signs Allowed on Private Property with and without Permits.
8-23
public right-of-way line. At all other locations, the sign shall not operate at a brightness
level of more than 0.3 foot-candles above ambient light levels measured at 100 feet
from the sign.
(6) An acceptable method for measuring the allowed brightness level for illuminated signs
is by recording the ambient light level reading for the sign at a designated
measurement distance, using a foot-candle meter, while the sign is off or displaying all
black. The foot-candle meter should be aimed directly at the sign at the appropriate
distance. A follow up recording should then be performed while the lights are
illuminated white.
(7) Each sign must have a light sensing device that will adjust the brightness of the display
as the natural ambient light conditions change.
(8) As part of an application for a sign permit, the sign owner must provide the Building
Official with a written statement from the installer that the sign will comply with the
citys brightness requirements and all other requirements of this Sec. 8-5(c), and shall
certify to such compliance within 30 days after installation of the sign.
(9) The owner of the variable message sign shall provide to the Building Official
information for a 24 hour contact able to turn off the sign promptly if a malfunction
occurs.
a. If, at any time, a malfunction occurs or the variable message sign is no longer
working properly, the owner of the sign shall turn off the illumination display and
shall make repairs to the sign within 60 days or electrical service to the sign will
be disconnected at the owners expense.
b. Should the illumination of a sign appear to be brighter than allowed under Sec. 8-
5(c)(5), above, the owner of the sign shall, within 24 hours of a request by the
Building Official, turn off the sign until the brightness level of the sign can either
be verified or corrected to be in compliance. The owner shall bear responsibility
of the expenses necessary to ensure the brightness level of the sign meets the
requirements of this Article.
(10) Operation of an electronic changeable copy sign in violation of any provision of this
Sec. 8-5(c), including overriding the signs light-sensing or fail-safe devices, may result
in the disconnection of the electrical power supply to the sign at the owners expense,
under the enforcement provisions of this Ordinance.
Sec. 8-6. - Signs Allowed on Private Property with and without Permits.
(a) Signs shall be allowed on private property in the city in accordance with, and only in
accordance with, Sec. 8-16 of this Article. If the letter P appears for a sign type in a column,
such sign is allowed without prior permit approval in the zoning districts represented by

Zoning Ordinance, may continue in existence subject to the following restrictions:
(a) Burdon of Proof:
(1) Signs for which documentation exists that the sign was erected in conformance with
the citys requirements and regulations are considered legal nonconforming signs.

with the owner of the sign. Lacking such proof, the sign may be determined to be an
illegal nonconforming sign and its removal required.
(b) In all use districts, legal nonconforming signs may continue in existence provided that the
size of the sign face, body or structure is not increased.

substitution or interchanging of poster panels, painted boards or demountable material on
nonconforming signs shall be allowed.
(e) A nonconforming sign may not be replaced by another nonconforming sign except were
changed conditions beyond the control of the owner render the sign nonconforming or
warrant the signs repair.
(f) An existing sign that was legally erected and that becomes nonconforming as to the setback
requirements of the city due to road widening may be moved to meet the setback
requirements of this Ordinance. Such sign shall not be increased in size or changed in any
manner except as to become conforming.
(g) All nonconforming banners, pennants, and portable signs in existence as of the date of
adoption or subsequent amendment of the Zoning Ordinance shall be removed within 12
months of such adoption or amendment.

provisions regarding variances in this Zoning Ordinance of the city of Newnan.
(b) Standards for Approval of a Variance for Signs.
In lieu of the standards for granting or denying variances set forth in the Appeals Article of
this Ordinance, the following standards shall be applicable with respect to the granting or
denial of variances under this Article. Variances from the provisions of this Article shall be
limited to the following hardship situations:
(1) Where the proximity of existing signs on adjoining lots causes the subject property to
be ineligible, due to spacing requirements, for a sign of the type sought; or
(2) Where visibility of a conforming sign from the public street and within 50 feet of the
proposed sign would be substantially impaired by existing trees, plants, natural
features, signs, buildings or structures on a different lot; and
a. Placement of the sign elsewhere on the lot would not remedy the visual
obstruction; and
b. Such visibility obstruction was not created by the owner of the subject property;
and
c. The variance proposed would not create a safety hazard to traffic.
(c) Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship. No
variance shall be granted to allow a greater number of signs, or greater size of sign, than
would be allowed if the hardship did not exist or allow a type of sign which otherwise is not
allowed in the zoning district involved.

Sec. 9-5. - Applicable Regulations.
Uses and development shall be subject to the requirements of the City of Newnan Code of
Ordinances, Floodplain Management and Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, as may be amended
from time to time.
DIVISION III  WATER RESOURCE PROTECTION DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED
Sec. 9-6. - Purpose.
The establishment of Water Resource Protection Districts is to define minimum development
standards and criteria, which well afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural
resources found throughout the city. Based on the findings of the City of Newnan Comprehensive
Plan, it has been determined the wise management of these resources is essential to maintaining the
health, safety, general welfare and economic well-being of the public.
Sec. 9-7. - Definitions Referenced.
The definitions of certain terms referenced in this Article are set forth in the Interpretation and
Definitions Article of this Ordinance, as amended.
Sec. 9-8. - Types of Water Resource Protection Districts.
(a) The Water Resource Protection Districts shall include the following:
(1) Groundwater Recharge Area Protection District.
(2) Wetlands Protection District.
(3) Water Supply Watershed District.
(b) The boundaries of these Water Resource Protection Districts are shown on a set of maps
designed as Overlay District and are included as part of the Official Zoning Map, which is on
file with the City Clerk's office.
Sec. 9-9. - Groundwater Recharge Area Protection District.
(a) Description.
Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities.
Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste, and septic tank effluents contribute to a
deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well
water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious
surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby
decreasing groundwater supplies.
(b) Purpose.
Sec. 9-9. - Groundwater Recharge Area Protection District.
9-4
The purpose of the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection District is to establish criteria to
protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks,
impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
(c) District Limits.
The groundwater recharge area protection map is delineated according to the Georgia
Department of Natural Resources' Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989
Edition) and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Pollution Susceptibility Map
Hydrological Atlas 20, 1992 Edition. Standards for this district shall comply with the DNR Rule
391-3-16-.02 Criteria for Protection of Groundwater Recharge Areas.
(d) Criteria in Significant Recharge Areas.
(1) New above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660
gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110% of the volume of such tanks or 110% of
the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural
purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(2) New Agricultural Waste Impoundment Sites.
a. All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
1. A high pollution susceptibility area; or
2. A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet; or
3. A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet.
b. Construction Standards.
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of
one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10 7 cm/sec or other
criteria established by the U. S. Soil Conservation Service. (The average size of existing
agricultural waste impoundments in Georgia is about 15 acre-feet; sheep-foot rollers
or pans with heavy rubber tires, which are normal equipment for most Georgia earthmoving
contractors, should be able to compact clay to the recommended vertical
hydraulic conductivity.)
(3) Minimum Lot Sizes for New Homes Served by Septic Tank/Drain Field Systems.
a. New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the
following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 on the Department of
Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter
DHR Table MT 1):
1. One hundred fifty percent (150%) of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR
Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; and

Sec. 9-10. - Wetlands Protection District.
(a) Description.
The wetlands within the City of Newnan are indispensable and fragile natural resources with
significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural
state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and
vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource
education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities.
(b) Purpose.
The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from
alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, flood
plain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas, and wildlife habitat
areas.
(c) District Limits.
These regulations shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the city. The adopted
Wetland Protection District Overlay Map shows the general location of wetlands, according to
the 1987 National Wetlands Inventory and should be consulted by persons considering activities
in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The standards for this district shall
comply with Department of Natural Resources Rule 391-3-16-.03 Criteria for Wetlands
Protection.
(d) Development Permit Required.
No regulated activity will be permitted within the Wetlands Protection District without written
permission or a permit from the City of Newnan. If the project is of a type that may result in a
disturbance of wetlands and is located within 50 feet of a Wetlands Protection District
boundary, as determined by the City of Newnan using the Generalized Wetlands Map, a U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands
Sec. 9-11. - Water Supply Watershed Protection District.
9-7
are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be
granted until a Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is issued.
(e) Allowed Uses.
The following uses are allowed by right within the Wetlands Protection District to the extent
they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require
structures, grading, fill draining or dredging:
(1) Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the
Georgia Forestry Commission. Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing
silvicultural activities. However, Section 404 does list some required road construction best
management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.
Exempstions include the following:
a. Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided
the conservation or preservation does not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of
the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit;
b. Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking,
boating, horseback riding and canoeing;
c. Natural water quality treatment or purification; and
d. Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and
pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices
approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
(f) Prohibited Uses.
The following uses are prohibited in a Wetlands Protection District:
(1) Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants, and
(2) Hazardous or sanitary landfills.
Sec. 9-11. - Water Supply Watershed Protection District.
(a) Description.
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic
climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public
drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be
threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land disturbing activities
associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage
capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can
introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water
treatment more complicated and expensive, and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial
land uses that involve the manufacturer, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste
materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies.
(b) Purpose.
The purpose of the Water Supply Watershed Protection District is to establish measures to
protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the city which will
Sec. 9-11. - Water Supply Watershed Protection District.
9-8
minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and maintain the yield of
the water supply watersheds.
(c) District Limits.
The Water Supply Watershed Protection District is hereby designated and shall comprise the
land areas which drain to the water supply intake and the public water supply reservoirs. The
boundary of the district is defined by the ridge lines of the respective watersheds and the
boundary of a radius 7 miles upstream of the respective public water supply and water supply
reservoirs. The district shall be further delineated and defined on the Water Supply Watershed
Protection District Overlay Map of the Official Zoning Map, which is hereby incorporated by
reference. The standards of this district shall comply with Department of Natural Resources
391-3-16-.01 Criteria for Water Supply Watersheds and the Reservoir Management Plan
adopted by Newnan Water, Sewerage and Light Commission and the City of Newnan.
(d) Allowed Uses.
Uses which were lawful at the time of adoption of this Section shall be allowed to continue as
lawful land uses until such time as the use is abandoned. All uses, except those uses set forth in
herein, allowed in the underlying zoning districts as established by this Zoning Ordinance are
permitted in the Water Supply Watershed District, subject to the Natural Buffer and Impervious
Surface Requirements in this Section.
(e) Exempted Uses.
The following uses are exempt from the stream corridor buffer and setback requirements of this
section if they meet the stipulated conditions:
(1) Utilities.
a. Utilities shall be located as far as reasonably possible from the stream bank and shall
not impair the quality of the drinking water system; and
b. Utilities shall be installed and maintained without changing the integrity of the buffer
and setback areas as much as possible.
(2) Forestry and Agricultural Activities.
a. Agricultural activities involving the planting and harvesting of crops are exempted if
they conform to the best management practices established by the Georgia
Department of Agriculture and USDA; and
b. Silviculture activities must conform to the best management practices established by
the Georgia Forestry Commission.
(f) Prohibited Uses within the Water Supply Watershed Protection District.
(1) All sanitary landfills with or without synthetic liners and leachate collection systems.
(2) All hazardous waste, treatment or disposal facilities.
(g) Natural Buffer Requirements.
(1) Within a 7-mile radius upstream of all public water intakes and water supply reservoirs a
100-foot wide natural buffer shall be maintained on both sides of all perennial stream
corridors as measured from the stream banks. Similarly, within the water supply
Sec. 9-11. - Water Supply Watershed Protection District.
9-9
watershed but outside the 7-mile radius, a natural buffer of 50 feet shall be maintained on
both sides of all perennial stream corridors as measured from the stream banks.
(2) A natural buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 150 feet from the boundary of any
existing or future water supply reservoir.
(h) Impervious Surface Requirements.
(1) No more than 25% of the total land area within a designated Water Supply Watershed
Protection District may be covered by impervious surface.
(2) Within a 7-mile radius upstream of all public water intakes, no impervious surface shall be
constructed within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of all perennial stream corridors
as measured from the stream banks; and
(3) Outside a 7-mile radius upstream of all public water intakes and water supply reservoirs, no
impervious surface shall be constructed within a 75-foot setback area on both sides of all
perennial stream corridors as measured from the stream banks.
(4) New facilities, located within 7 miles of a water supply intake or water supply reservoir,
which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and
amounts of 10,000 pounds on any one day or more, shall perform their operations on
impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention
requirements or the requirements of the Standard Fire Prevention Code.
(i) Alternate Minimum Criteria for Water Supply Watersheds.
(1) Applicability.
a. Alternative minimum criteria for the stream buffer requirements in paragraph (g)
above may apply, upon certification by the Director of the Georgia Environmental
Protection Division (EPD) that the City of Newnan has a program in place that is
adequate to implement and enforce these alternative minimum criteria in accordance
with EPD Rule 391-3-16-.01 Criteria for Water Supply Watersheds.
b. After the effective date of EPD certification, the creation of lots on which there is not
sufficient area for construction is prohibited.
c. A copy of the EPD certification shall be kept on file in the offices of the City of Newnan
Engineering Department.
(2) Alternative Minimum Criteria.
Upon receiving said EPD certification, the following alternative shall apply, as described in
paragraphs a below and b below:
a. For a 1-mile radius upstream of a public water supply intake, there is a 100-foot
critical area with an undisturbed buffer on both sides of the stream; for the balance of
the watershed, there is a 50-foot undisturbed buffer on both sides of the stream.
b. Beyond the adopted 50-foot and 100-foot riparian buffers, development or
redevelopment is allowed but is limited to an effective impervious cover of 10% of a
parcel for either lots immediately adjacent to a perennial stream or for the area of
land within 150 feet of a perennial stream, whichever is larger. On single, individual
Sec. 9-11. - Water Supply Watershed Protection District.
9-10
lots this requirement shall be triggered for projects with greater than 5,000 square
feet of impervious surfaces.
(3) Approvals.
All approvals for the subdivision or development of parcels shall include a determination
that the subject parcel or parcels within a development are consistent with the buffers
required hereunder and that all plats of survey and approvals provide clear notice of the
alternative minimum criteria and requirements adopted by the City of Newnan.

Sec. 10-16. - Conditional Zoning.
10-12
Sec. 10-16. - Conditional Zoning.
In adopting a map amendment, the Planning Commission may recommend, and the City
Council may impose, special conditions which they deem necessary in order to make the
requested action acceptable and consistent with the proposed uses of the district(s) involved
and to further the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Conditional uses should not
be confused with conditions of zoning, which are conditions specific to a development proposal
that may be applied by City Council regarding such proposal.
(a) Such conditions may consist of:
(1) Setback requirements from any lot line.
(2) Specified or prohibited locations for buildings, parking, loading or storage areas or
other land uses.
(3) Driveway curb cut restrictions.
(4) Landscaping or planted area which may include berms, or other buffering
provisions or protective measures.

carry traffic generated by the proposed development.
(11) Other conditions of approval deemed necessary by the City Council to reduce or
avoid potential adverse effects of the development, use or operation of the subject
property on the health, safety or general welfare of the public.
(b) Such conditions:
(1) Shall only be valid if they are included in the motion approving the map
amendment.
(2) Shall be permanent conditions of approval unless a lesser period of time is
specified in the approval.
(3) Shall be required of the property owner and subsequent owners as a condition of
their use of the property.
(4) Shall be permitted and continuously enforced by the City in the same manner as
any other provision of this Ordinance.
(c) Change in Conditions of Approval.
Sec. 10-18. - Implementation of Conditions of Zoning Approval.
10-13
Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval previously
established by the City Council through action on a rezoning shall be considered a new
application and therefore subject to all procedures and provisions of this Ordinance
regarding the approval of a map amendment.
Sec. 10-17. - Proffered Conditions.
(a) As part of an application for a rezoning, the applicant may proffer in writing the provision
of reasonable proposed conditions to apply and be part of the rezoning sought to be
approved by said application. Proffered conditions may include written statements,
development plans, profiles, elevations, or other demonstrative materials.
(b) Proffered conditions may be included as a condition of zoning approval by the City
Council, modified by the City Council, or not included by the City Council in their rezoning
approval. Proffered conditions are not binding on the City Council and become effective,
in whole, part or as modified, only through inclusion or reference in the motion for
approval by the City Council at the time of rezoning approval.
Sec. 10-18. - Implementation of Conditions of Zoning Approval.
(a) Zoning Conditions Govern Development.
Zoning conditions shall become a part of the zoning regulations applicable to the property
unless subsequently changed by an amendment to the Official Zoning Map, which
amendment is not part of a comprehensive implementation of a new or substantially
revised zoning ordinance, and such conditions shall be in addition to the specific
regulations set forth in this Ordinance for the zoning district in question.
(b) Substantial Conformance Required.
Upon approval of a rezoning with conditions, any site plan, subdivision plat, development
plan or other application for development thereafter submitted shall be in substantial
conformance with all approved conditions. No development shall be approved by any City
official in the absence of said substantial conformance.
(c) Substantial Conformance Defined.
For the purpose of this Section, substantial conformance shall be determined by the
Planning and Zoning Director and shall mean that conformance which leaves a reasonable
margin for adjustment due to final design or engineering data but conforms with the
general nature of the development, the specific uses, and the general layout depicted by
the plans, profiles, elevations, and other demonstrative materials proffered by the applicant.
(d) Enforcement of Zoning Conditions.
The Building Official, or the Building Officials designee, shall be vested with all necessary
authority on behalf of the City Council to administer and enforce zoning conditions. Such
authority shall include the ability to order, in writing, the remedy of any nonconformity
Sec. 10-19. - Hearing before Planning Commission.

with a zoning condition and the ability to bring legal action to ensure compliance including
injunction, abatement, or other appropriate action or proceedings, as provided for in the
Administration and Enforcement Article of this Ordinance. Any person, group, company, or
organization aggrieved by an interpretation of a zoning condition by the Building Official,
or the Building Officials designee, may appeal such interpretation as provided by Sec. 10-
18(g).
(e) Guarantee for Construction of Improvements.
A guarantee, satisfactory to the City Council, may be required in an amount sufficient for
and conditioned upon, the construction of any public improvements required by the
approved zoning conditions. This guarantee may be reduced or released by the City
Council, or the City Manager on the Councils behalf, upon the submission of satisfactory
evidence that the construction of such improvements has been completed in whole or in
part. Said guarantee shall be required no later than final site plan approval or subdivision
approval.
(f) No Permits Shall Be Issued Not In Compliance With Zoning Conditions.
Failure to meet or comply with any zoning conditions shall be sufficient cause to deny the
issuance of any site plan or subdivision approvals, grading permits, zoning permits,
building permits, or certificates of occupancy as may be determined appropriate by the
Building Official or the Planning and Zoning Director. In addition to the other penalties
appropriate for violations of this Ordinance, failure to meet or comply with any zoning
conditions shall be sufficient cause to deny the issuance of any development approvals or
permits relating to the land area which was the subject of the conditional zoning. To this
end, each application for a development approval or permit shall include an affidavit by
the applicant that all applicable zoning conditions have or will be complied with as
approved by the City Council at the time of rezoning. The burden shall be on the applicant
to verify that proposed development complies with any and all approved zoning
conditions.
(g) Appeal of Zoning Condition Decision.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Building Official or the Planning and Zoning
Director regarding any zoning condition may appeal such decision to the City Council. Such
appeal shall be filed within 30 calendar days from the date of the decision appealed by
filing a notice of appeal with the Planning and Zoning Director. Such notice shall be a
written statement specifying the grounds on which aggrieved and the basis for the appeal.
Upon receipt of the appeal notice, the City Council shall take such testimony as it deems
appropriate and shall render its decision within 60 calendar days after receipt of the

Planning Commission may recommend a revision to the proposal.
(2) If the proposed amendment consists of a change in zoning district boundaries, the
Planning Commission may reduce or enlarge the extent of land that it recommends

district classification than that requested if, in either case, the Planning
Commission is of the opinion that such revision is in accordance with sound zoning
practice and the adopted Comprehensive Plan, and is in furtherance of the
purposes of this Ordinance. Before recommending a larger extent of land or a
rezoning to a more intensive classification than was set forth in the application, the
Commission shall hold an additional duly noticed public hearing on the matter.

consideration to the applicable standards of review specified under Sec. 10-25.
(e) Failure of the Planning Commission to provide a recommendation to the City Council

the adopted Comprehensive Plan and is in furtherance of the purposes of this
Ordinance. Before rezoning a larger extent of land or rezoning the land to a more

which have the potential for a deleterious
impact upon the health, safety, and
welfare of the public or where the impact
of the use on the immediate area or the
city in general related to traffic, utilities, or
other factors requires additional review
criteria or requirements; and, in the event
such uses or structures are approved, the
authority to impose such conditions that
are designed to avoid, minimize, or
mitigate potentially adverse effects upon
the community or other properties in the
vicinity of the proposed use or structure.
Sec. 10-27. - Applicability.
The requirements herein established
shall apply to all special exception uses or
structures identified in this Ordinance.

exception on surrounding properties?
(b) In addition, the same information required for an application for a zoning map

Director shall forward the application for special exception to such board or agency
for appropriate action prior to the notification to an applicant that the application
is ready to be presented to the hearing authority (i.e., Board of Zoning Appeals, the
Planning Commission or City Council). If they deem it appropriate, the hearing
authority may approve an application contingent on required action by the other
board or agency.
(c) Special Exception Report and Notice to Applicant.
The Planning and Zoning Department shall compile the referrals and any other necessary
information, prepare a written staff report with proposed findings and a recommendation,
and notify the applicant that the report is complete and the application is ready to be

Sec. 10-32. - Amendment to Application.
An application for a special exception may be amended by the submittal of additional
information or proposed changes to the application after it has been accepted.
(a) If the additional information or proposed changes submitted are to conform to
recommendations made by City staff or by the hearing authority at their public hearing,
then it shall not be deemed an amendment and the application shall continue to be
processed on its original timeline.
(b) However, if the additional information or proposed changes submitted by the applicant
are at the applicant's request, then the Planning and Zoning Director shall review the
information within 15-calendar days of receipt and render a finding as to whether the
submitted information necessitates repeating any portion of the review process (including
the public hearing).
Sec. 10-35. - Conditional Approval.
10-23
(c) If any portion must be repeated, the Planning and Zoning Director will notify the applicant
in writing within the 15-calendar day period that the additional information or proposed
changes will require an extension of the time limits prescribed in this Section and such
notice shall specify the required extension.
(d) The applicant will then have 15 calendar days to provide the Planning and Zoning Director
with a written response either granting the necessary extension or withdrawing the
additional information or proposed changes which necessitated the extension. If the
applicant chooses to withdraw the information, then the application will proceed based on
its original timeline.
Sec. 10-33. - Withdrawal of Application.
(a) A special exception application may be withdrawn upon written request by the applicant
any time prior to the deadline for publication of the notice of its public hearing; provided
that if the request for withdrawal is made after such deadline, such withdrawal shall be
only with the consent of the hearing authority.
(b) If the hearing authority consents to the withdrawal of a special exception application, no
new special exception application concerning any or all of the same property shall be filed
within 12 months of the date of withdrawal, unless the hearing authority specifies at the
time it consents to withdrawal that said time limitation shall not apply.
(c) In the event that a special exception application is withdrawn under any circumstances,
the application fee shall not be refunded.
Sec. 10-34. - Limitation on Application after Denial.

application concerning any or all of the same property shall not be filed within 12 months of the
date of denial; provided, however, that only the City Council may allow a special exception
application to be resubmitted on the same property provided final action on the request will
occur not less than 6 months after the date of denial.
Sec. 10-35. - Conditional Approval.
(a) As part of approving a special exception, the hearing authority may impose such
conditions, safeguards and restrictions upon the premises benefited by the special
exception as may be necessary to avoid, minimize or mitigate any potentially adverse or
injurious effect of such special exceptions upon other surrounding or nearby properties, to
carry out the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance, or to further the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. Conditional uses should not be confused with
conditions of approval, which are conditions specific to a special exception request that
may be applied by the hearing authority in approving such application.
Sec. 10-39. - Issues for Consideration.
10-24
(b) Such conditions may consist of any of the same conditions that can be applied to a zoning
map amendment under Sec. 10-16(a), and shall be treated in the same manner as
required for a zoning map amendment under Sec. 10-16(b).
(c) Change in Conditions of Approval.
Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval previously
established by the hearing authority through action on a special exception shall be
considered a new application and therefore subject to all procedures and provisions of
this Ordinance regarding the approval of a special exception.
Sec. 10-36. - Proffered Conditions.
(a) As part of an application for a special exception, the applicant may proffer in writing the
provision of reasonable proposed conditions to apply and be part of the special exception
sought to be approved by said application. Proffered conditions may include written
statements, development plans, profiles, elevations, or other demonstrative materials.
(b) Proffered conditions may be included as a condition of approval by the hearing authority,
modified by such applicable body, or not included in their approval of the special
exception. Proffered conditions are not binding on the City and become effective, in
whole, part or as modified, only through inclusion or reference in the motion for approval
at the time the special exception is approved.
Sec. 10-37. - Implementation of Conditions of Special Exception Approval.

No variance from any of the provisions of this Ordinance relating to the use or density of
land, buildings or structures may be granted. Nor shall a variance be granted for any use or
activity within any designated floodway if any increase in the 100-year flood elevations would
result. Nor shall any determination be made that has the effect of setting a new standard or
rendering any provision of this Ordinance obsolete or invalid.
Sec. 11-6. - Administrative Variances.
The Planning and Zoning Director shall have the authority to grant limited minor
administrative variances from certain provisions of the zoning and stream buffer ordinance
where the Planning and Zoning Director determines that:
(a) The strict application of the requirements of the ordinance would cause undue and
unnecessary hardship to the property owner or authorized agent; and
(b) That such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district
and the same vicinity; and
Sec. 11-7. - Application for Variance.
11-4
(c) That the authorization of such modification or alteration will not be of substantial
detriment to contiguous property and that the character of the zoning district will not be
changed by granting the request; and
(d) The intent and continued integrity of the ordinance can be achieved with equal
performance and protection of public interests through granting of an administrative
variance.
(e) All applications for administrative variances shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Department. The application for an administrative variance shall be subject to the
standards in Sec. 11-9 of the Zoning Ordinance and Section 10-114 (b) of the City of
Newnan Code of Ordinance pertaining to Stream Buffers. The authority to grant such
administrative variances shall be limited to variance from the following requirements:
(1) Principal Building Front, Side, Street Side and Rear Setbacks.
A variance shall not exceed 15% of the footage deducted from the required setback.
Factors to be considered include the average of principal building setbacks of
adjoining and contiguous properties.
(2) Principal Living Space.
A variance shall not exceed 25% of the square footage deducted from the required
principal living space. Factors to be considered include the average of principal living
space square footage calculations of adjoining and contiguous properties.
(3) Stream Buffer.
For lots established prior to the 2008 adoption of the City of Newnans Stream Buffer
Regulations, consideration may be given to modify the Citys stream buffers. Final
authorization shall be contingent upon a favorable recommendation from the City of
Newnans Engineering Department of the site development plan specific to the
property that is the subject of the variance application.
Sec. 11-7. - Application for Variance.
Any person owning property, or having a possessory or contract interest in property and
the consent of the owner, may file an application for variance in regard to such property with
the Planning and Zoning Director for one or more of the variances authorized above. The
application shall contain the following information and such additional information as the BZA
may, by rule, require:
(a) The particular provisions or requirements of this Ordinance which prevent the proposed
construction on, or use of, the property.
(b) The existing zoning of the property, including any previously approved modifications,
conditions, or proffers.
(c) The special conditions, circumstances or characteristics of the land, building or structure
that prevent the use of the land in compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
Sec. 11-9. - Standards for Variances.
11-5
(d) The particular hardship which would result if the specified provisions or requirements of
this Ordinance were to be applied to the subject property.
(e) The minimum extent to which it would be necessary to vary the requirements of this
Ordinance in order to permit the proposed construction on, or use of, the property.
(f) An explanation of how the requested variance conforms to each of the applicable findings
and standards is set out in Sec. 11-9.
Sec. 11-8. - Decision on Variance Application.
Upon receipt of a complete application for a variance, the Planning and Zoning Director
shall notify the hearing authority (i.e., the BZA, the Planning Commission or the City Council, as
appropriate), which shall, within 30 days, hold a duly noticed public hearing thereon. In this
capacity the body hearing the variance request exercises appellate jurisdiction as a quasijudicial
body, and its task is to determine that an undue hardship exists and what remedy is
appropriate based on the facts of the particular situation.
(a) Legal Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the same manner as for a zoning
decision under the Procedures and Permits Article of this Ordinance.
(b) The hearing shall be held in accordance with the procedures for holding a public hearing
for a zoning decision under the Procedures and Permits Article.
(c) The hearing authority shall, after such hearing, either approve, deny or approve with
conditions the application for a variance.
(d) The decision of the body hearing the variance request shall be supported by findings of
fact and conclusions with respect to the standards set out in Sec. 11-9 below.
Sec. 11-9. - Standards for Variances.
The hearing authority considering the variance request shall base its required findings of
fact upon the particular evidence presented to it in each specific case where the property
owner can show all of the following to be true:
(a) The strict application of the terms of this Ordinance would effectively prohibit or
unreasonably restrict utilization of the property because of all of the following:
(1) There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece
of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; and,
(2) Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of such property involved; and,
(3) Such conditions were not imposed by the action or will of the owner of the property;
and,
(4) The application of the Ordinance to the particular piece of property would create an
unnecessary hardship other than a financial hardship in which the applicant would
receive a lower rate of financial return on the use of the property if the variance is
denied; and,
Sec. 11-12. - Withdrawal of Application.
11-6
(5) Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair
the purposes and intent of this Ordinance.
(b) In addition, the hearing authority considering the variance request shall affirmatively
determine that:
(1) The granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship
approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience
sought by the applicant.
(2) The condition or situation of the property which gives rise to the need for such
variance is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable
the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this
Ordinance.
Sec. 11-10. - Burden of Applicant.
The applicant for a variance shall bear the burden of producing evidence to establish that
the requested variance satisfies all of the standards for a variance of Sec. 11-9 above.
Sec. 11-11. - Conditions and Restrictions.
(a) As part of approving a variance, the hearing authority may impose such conditions,
safeguards and restrictions upon the property or project benefited by the variance as may
be necessary to avoid, minimize or mitigate any potentially adverse or injurious effect of
such variance upon other surrounding or nearby properties, to carry out the general
purpose and intent of this Ordinance, or to further the goals and objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan.
(b) Such conditions may consist of any of the same conditions that can be applied to a zoning
map amendment and shall be treated in the same manner as required for a zoning map
amendment under the Procedures and Permits Article of this Ordinance.
(c) Change in Conditions of Approval.
Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval previously
established for the variance shall be considered a new application and therefore subject to
all procedures and provisions of this Ordinance regarding the approval of a variance.
Sec. 11-12. - Withdrawal of Application.
A variance may be withdrawn by the applicant at any time prior to the deadline for
cancellation of the newspaper advertisement for the public hearing on the application. After
said deadline, an application may be withdrawn only at the advertised public hearing with the
permission of the body hearing the variance request.
Sec. 11-17. - Withdrawal of Application.
11-7
Sec. 11-13. - Re-Application.
If a variance is denied, no application requesting the same relief with respect to all or part
of the same property shall be considered within 12 months after the date of such denial.
Sec. 11-14. - Appeals (From Administrative Ruling).
The BZA is authorized to hear appeals taken from any aggrieved person from any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by any City official in the administration or
enforcement of this Ordinance. In this capacity the Board exercises appellate jurisdiction as a
quasi-judicial body, and its task is to determine what the Ordinance means and how the
Ordinance applies to the facts of a particular situation.
Sec. 11-15. - When Administrative Appeals May Be Taken.
Appeals shall be taken within 30 days after the decision has been rendered by filing with
the Planning and Zoning Director (or with the City official from whom the appeal is taken, if not
the Planning and Zoning Director) a notice of appeal specifying the grounds of the appeal. The
Planning and Zoning Director shall assemble all the papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken, and forward such record to the chairman of the BZA (and
to the City official from whom the appeal is taken, if not the Planning and Zoning Director).
Sec. 11-16. - Decisions on Administrative Appeals.
(a) Within 90 days after the notice of administrative appeal has been filed, the BZA shall hold
a public hearing which shall be advertised and posted as follows, as well as due notice
given to the parties in interest.
(1) Legal Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the same manner as for a zoning
decision under the Procedures and Permits Article.
(2) The hearing shall be held in accordance with the procedures for holding a public
hearing for a zoning decision under the Procedures and Permits Article.
(b) The BZA shall, after such hearing, decide the appeal, and file with the Planning and Zoning
Director its findings of fact and conclusions with respect to the appeal. In exercising its
powers, the BZA may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision
appealed from. The concurring vote of a majority of BZA members shall be necessary to
reverse a decision.
(c) The Planning and Zoning Director shall provide a copy of the decision to the appellant, to
the City official from whom the appeal is taken (if not the Planning and Zoning Director),
and to each other person who was a party of record at the hearing.
Sec. 11-17. - Withdrawal of Application.
An administrative appeal may be withdrawn by the appellant at any time prior to the
deadline for cancellation of the newspaper advertisement for the public hearing on the
Sec. 11-18. - Stay of Proceedings.
11-8
application. After said deadline, an appeal may be withdrawn only with the permission of the
BZA at the advertised public hearing.
Sec. 11-18. - Stay of Proceedings.
(a) A notice of appeal or an application for a variance, properly filed as herein provided, shall
stay all enforcement or administrative proceedings related to the variance or appeal,
unless the Planning and Zoning Director (or the responsible City official if not the Planning
and Zoning Director) certifies to the hearing authority that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In
such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.
(b) Where a building permit has been issued and the construction of the building for which
such permit was issued is subsequently sought to be prevented, restrained, corrected or
abated as a violation of this or any other City ordinance, by a lawsuit properly filed by a
private party, the court may hear and determine the issues raised in the litigation even
though no appeal was taken to the appropriate hearing authority. However, the City may
suspend the building permit or discontinue further construction activities pursuant
thereto only upon issuance of a stop work order or a restraining order by said court.

the existence of a stream.
STREAM BANK. See River/Stream Bank.
STREET. A public or private thoroughfare used, or intended to be used, for passage or travel
by motor vehicles. Streets are further classified by the functions they perform.
ARTERIALS:
Urban Principal Arterial System  Serve the major centers of activity of a metropolitan
area, the highest traffic volume corridors, and the longest trip desires; and should carry
a high proportion of the total urban area travel on a minimum of mileage. The system
should be integrated, both internally and between major rural connections.
Because of the nature of the travel served by the principal arterial system, almost all
fully and partially controlled access facilities will be part of this functional system. In
order to preserve the identification of controlled access facilities, the principal arterial
system is stratified as follows:
Interstate Principal Arterial  Those routes presently designated by the USDOT as part
of the Interstate System.
Urban Freeway and Expressway  Limited-access urban arterials not on the Interstate
System.
Urban Principal Arterial  Uncontrolled or partial controlled access.
Urban Minor Arterial Street System  The minor arterial street system should
interconnect with and augment the urban principal arterial system but provide service
at a lower level of mobility than urban principal arterials.
Urban Minor Arterial Street  Provide service to trips of moderate length within an
urban area, and this system should distribute travel to geographic areas smaller than
those identified with the higher system. Such facilities may carry local bus routes and
provide intra-community continuity but ideally should not penetrate identifiable
neighborhoods. This system should include urban connections to rural collector roads
where such connections have not been classified as urban principal arterials.
The spacing of minor arterial streets may vary from 1/8 - 1/2 mile in the central
business district to 2 - 3 miles in the suburban fringes, but should normally be not more
than 1 mile in fully developed areas.
S
13-42
COLLECTORS:
Urban Collector Street System  The collector street system provides land access
service and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods, commercial and
industrial areas.
Urban Collector Street- Collects traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods
and channels it into the arterial system. In the central business district, and in other
areas of like development and traffic density, the collector system may include the
street grid which forms a logical entity for traffic circulation.
LOCAL ROADS:
Urban Local Street System  The local street system comprises all facilities not on one
of the higher systems.
Urban Local Road  Serves primarily to provide direct access to abutting property and
access to the higher order systems. It offers the lowest level of mobility and usually
contains no bus routes. Service to through-traffic movement usually is deliberately
discouraged. Urban local roads constitute the urban public road mileage not classified
as part of the principal arterial, minor arterial, or collector systems inside of urban
areas.
STREET FRONTAGE. The length of any one property line of a premises, which property line
abuts a legally accessible street right-of-way. For the purposes of determining yard
requirements on corner lots, all sides of a lot adjacent to streets shall be considered
frontage, and yards shall be provided as indicated under the zoning definition for yards.
STREET, PRIVATE. A street that has not been accepted by the City.
STREET, PUBLIC. A street that has been accepted by the City.

carports, sheds, tents, animal kennels or structures, storerooms, gasoline pumps, gas or
liquid storage tanks, or other manmade facilities or infrastructures whether stationary
or movable.
STUCCO. Plaster or cement, either fine or coarse, used for surfacing inside or outside walls
or for molding relief ornaments, cornices, etc.

W
13-48
into rooms, or protects or delineates a space in the open air. There are three principal
types of structural walls: building walls, exterior boundary walls, and retaining walls.
Building walls have two main purposes: to support roofs and ceilings, and to divide
space, providing security against intrusion and weather. Boundary walls include privacy
walls, boundary-marking walls, and city walls. The conventional differentiation
between a boundary wall and a fence is that a fence is of minimal thickness and often is
open in nature, while a wall is usually more than a nominal thickness and is completely
closed, or opaque. More to the point, if an exterior structure is made of wood or wire,
it is generally referred to as a fence, while if it is made of masonry, it is considered a
wall. Retaining walls are a special type of wall that may be either external to a building
or part of a building that serves to provide a barrier to the movement of earth, stone or
water. The ground surface or water on one side of a retaining wall will be noticeably
higher than on the other side.

materials that are inflammable or explosive or that create hazardous or commonly
recognized offensive conditions.
WASTE TRANSFER STATION. A facility used to transfer certain types of solid waste from one
transportation vehicle to another for transportation to a solid waste disposal facility or
processing operation. A Waste Transfer Station includes the enclosed waste
management structure (tipping floors and loading bays) and ancillary buildings and
equipment, including but not limited to, scale house, scales, truck/equipment
maintenance/fueling areas, and transport truck staging areas.
WATER RESOURCE DISTRICT. A map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition
to those of the underlying zoning district. See also the Environmental Protection Article
of this Ordinance.
WATERCOURSE. Any material or artificial watercourse, stream. river, creek channel, ditch.

either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks,
and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or
floodwater.
WATERSHED. The entire land area contributing surface drainage to a specific point (e.g. a
water supply intake).
WETLANDS. Those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency
and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support a
prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological
parameters for designating wetlands include hydro soils, hydrological vegetation and
Y

hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause
soil saturation.
Y
YARD. A required unoccupied open space on a lot with a building or structure, adjoining a
lot line, containing only landscaping or other uses as provided by this Ordinance.

GUIDELINES FOR NEW
CONSTRUCTION
Section 1: Purpose and Intent.
New construction should be designed to be compatible with its surroundings
by borrowing design characteristics and materials from adjacent buildings
and integrating (not copying) these into a modern expression. The underlying
guideline for new construction and additions is to consider ones neighbors
and nearby structures and to reinforce the existing character through
sensitive, compatible design. The quality and excellence in design should be
major determinants in deciding appropriate new construction.
The following aspects of new construction shall be visually compatible with
the buildings and environment with which the new construction is visually
related, the height, the gross volume, the proportion between width and
height of the facades, the proportions and relationship between doors and
windows, the rhythm of solids to voids created by openings in the façade,
and materials used in the façade, the texture inherent in the façade, the
colors, pattern and trip used in the façade and the design of the roof.
Before designing new development, take time to evaluate what makes the
property and its surrounding area distinctive. Then decide how the new
development can best be designed to complement the property and area.
The following steps will assist in designing new development compatible with
the existing historic district.
4
Section 2. Define the Area of Influence.
The first step in considering the appropriateness of a design for a new
building in a historic district is to determine the area of influence which will
be affected by the new development. The area of influence will be that area
which will be visually influenced by the new building. A consistent
streetscape will result when new buildings are designed in consideration with
what already exists.
Area of influence: Each site within a historic distinct will have its own unique area of influence.
Shown here are two different examples with suggested minimum areas that might be
considered. Neighboring buildings should be examined to determine the consistent patterns of
design concepts and architectural elements that are present.
5
a. Area of Influence with Historic Resources
If the area of influence contains historic resources, the next step is to
determine the prevailing character of the existing development within the
area of influence. Proceed to Section 3: Recognize Prevalent Character
of Existing Development on page 6
b. Area of Influence without Historic Resources
If the area of influence does not contain historic resources, the new
construction should be in keeping with the district as a whole and follow
these guidelines.
Standards
a. New construction should enhance the overall character of
the historic district and contribute to the districts ongoing
evolution.
b. New construction should be compatible with the dominant
design characteristics of historic buildings with similar
uses (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial) within the
district. Design characteristics to be considered include
building orientation and setback, scale, directional
emphasis, shape, proportion, rhythm, massing, and
architectural and site elements.
6
Section 3. Recognize Prevalent Character of Existing Development.
Every building, whether historic or modern, is a product of design, and the
design of buildings is determined by the way in which basic design concepts
are utilized. These design concepts include:
Building Orientation and Setback Directional Emphasis
Shape Rhythm
Proportion Massing
Scale/Height Architectural and Site Elements
When a new structure is built among historic buildings, the level of success
with which it relates to existing buildingsand whether it contributes or
detracts from the areawill be determined by the ways in which its design
recognizes the prevailing design expression in the area of influence.
Standards
a. Identify and respect the prevailing character of adjacent
historic buildings and surrounding development.
Following are definitions for the basic design concepts listed above and
guidelines for evaluating these concepts in proposed new buildings or
additions. Line drawings illustrate the design concepts for both commercial
and residential buildings.
7
a. Building Orientation and Setback
Building orientation refers to the directional placement of the building on the
site, while setback refers to how far back the building is from the street and
side lot lines. Typically, historic areas have strong predominant orientations
and setbacks.
Standards
a. The orientation of a new building and its site placement
should be consistent with dominant patterns within the
area of influence.
+Building Orientation/Setback-The proposed commercial building in this illustration
respects prevailing orientation and setback patterns of this commercial row.
-Building Setback-The proposed
commercial building is in violation of
the established setback of the street.
-Building Orientation-The proposed
commercial building in this
illustration is inconsistent with the
established front-façade
orientation pattern of the
adjacent commercial buildings.
?
?
8
b. Directional Emphasis
Most buildings are either vertical or horizontal in their directional emphasis.
This is determined by a buildings overall shape as well as by the size and
placement of elements and openings on the buildings front facade.
Directional emphasis may also be influenced by surface materials and
architectural detailing.
Standards
a. A new buildings directional emphasis should be
consistent with dominant patterns of directional emphasis
within the area of influence.
?
?
+Directional Emphasis-These commercial buildings exhibit horizontal directional
emphasis.
-Directional Emphasis-These historic commercial buildings (left) each have vertical
directional emphasis, but the proposed building (right) is clearly horizontal in
emphasis. This new building is neither sympathetic nor consistent with the
established pattern of directional emphasis along this commercial street.
9
c. Shape
A buildings surfaces and edges define its overall shape. The overall shape, in
concert with the shapes of individual elementsroof pitch, window and door
openings, and porch form (if a porch exists)is important in establishing
rhythms in a streetscape. Shape can also be an important element of style.
Standards Roof Pitch
a. The roof pitch of a new building should be consistent with
those of existing buildings within the area of influence.
-Shape - Roof Pitch  The gabled +Shape  Roof Pitch  Many institutroof
of the new building is in- ional and some commercial buildings
appropriate in this row of flat-roofed have hipped or gabled roofs. If historic
commercial buildings. pitched roof on new construction would be
appropriate.
10
Standards  Building Elements
a. The principal elements and shapes used on the front
facade of a new building should be compatible with those
of existing buildings in the area of influence.
?
?

of the new building are incompatible example has window and
in shape with the elements of the door openings compatible
surrounding historic commercial buildings. With those in its area of
influence.
11
d. Proportion
Proportion is the relationship of one dimension to another; for example, the
relationship of the height to the width of a building, or the height and width
of windows and doors. Individual elements of a building should be
proportional to each other and the building.
Standards
a. The proportions of a new building should be consistent
with dominant patterns of proportion of existing
buildings in the area of influence.
-Proportion  The front-façade height- +Proportion  The front-façade heightto-
width ratio of the proposed commercial to-width ratio of this commercial
building, resulting in a very horizontal example has a vertical expression

expression of existing buildings.
Commercial Proportions: The above graphic illustrates
the concept of proportion using commercial building dimensions.
12
e. Rhythm
Standards
a. New construction in a historic area should respect and not
disrupt existing rhythmic patterns in the area of influence.
Rhythm  This row of commercial buildings illustrates the rhythm created by storefronts and
upper-story windows.
?
-Rhythm  Established setback- These two rows of commercial buildings along a street have
an established setback. The proposed building disrupts the rhythm of the setback along the
street.
13
f. Massing
Massing has to do with the way in which a buildings volumetric components
(i.e., main body, roof, bays, overhangs, and porches) are arranged and with
the relationship between solid wall surfaces and openings.
Standards
a. The massing of a new building should be consistent with
dominant massing patterns of existing buildings in the
area of influence, if such patterns are apparent.
g. Scale and Height
Scale refers to the apparent relationship between two entities, such as the
relationship of a buildings height to human height, the relationship between
different buildings heights and sizes, or the relationship between the size of
an addition and the building to which it is attached. In a historic district, the
two most important issues are (1) the relationship of the scale of new
construction to historic and (2) the relationship of the scale of additions to
the historic building to which they are being added.
Standards
a. A proposed new building should conform to the floor-tofloor
heights of existing structures if there is a dominant
pattern within the area of influence.
b. New construction in historic areas should be consistent
with dominant patterns of scale within the area of
influence.
c. Additions to historic buildings should not overwhelm the
existing building.
-Scale/Height  The scale of the
proposed commercial building is
incompatible with other buildings in the
area of influence. The floor-to-floor
height and building elements are much
larger scale than those of the
surrounding buildings.
14
??? ? ? ? ? ? -Scale/Height  This addition is too
large and overwhelms the existing
commercial building.
15
h. Architectural and Site Elements
Predominant architectural and site elements in the area of influence should
also be taken into account when designing new construction. The following
elements should be considered.
Roofs 
The majority of commercial building roofs are flat or only slightly pitched and
hidden by parapet walls. Industrial buildings may have more steeply pitched
roofs and very distinctive parapet walls. Some commercial buildings and
many institutional buildings have hipped or gabled roofs as a predominant
characteristic.
Walls 
The surfaces of commercial building walls are generally relatively smooth and
uninterrupted with the exception of building and storefront cornices and
sometimes awnings. Institutional building walls may be broken by projecting
architectural elements.
Windows and Entrances 
First-floor storefront entrances are distinctive to commercial buildings and
are important architectural elements. Other patterns of window and door
openings, including placement, size, or ornamentation, may provide strong
visual components in a commercial area.
Details 
Building and storefront cornices, parapet walls, masonry or cast iron
storefront piers, and other decorative details can provide a pattern and scale
to historic commercial buildings.
Materials 
Commercial buildings may incorporate brick or stone masonry, stucco, cast
iron, pressed metal, wood, and other historically compatible materials. These
materials have different textures and shapes which give variety to the
appearance of a commercial building.
The application of any exterior finish material, such as an exterior insulating
finishing system, to historic exterior materials is strongly discouraged.
Landscape Elements 
Specific types of vegetation such as live oak trees, shrubs, or expanses of
grassy lawn may predominate in a residential area. Architectural elements
such as fences, walls, garden architecture, outbuildings, or flower beds may
also contribute to visual continuity along the street.
Street trees, sidewalks, and curbs are generally the dominant landscape
elements in a commercial area. Larger green spaces with trees, shrubs, and
16
lawn areas may be found around institutional buildings. These elements
contribute to visual continuity along a commercial street.
Parking 
Parking to the rear of buildings rather than to the front of buildings is
encouraged wherever possible. This will also help avoid setbacks that are out
of character with the historic pattern and to preserve greenspace.
Standards
a. New construction should reference and not conflict with
the predominant site and architectural elements of
existing properties in the area of influence.
17
Section 4. Respect the Prevailing Character When Designing New
Development.
After identifying the area of influence and assessing the prevailing character
of the existing development within that area, the next step is to begin the
design of the project. Each project is unique and needs to be taken on a
case-by-case basis to meet the needs of the owner while at the same time
protecting the historic character of the property and area. Following are some
general concepts that can assist with the design of new development. Use
these concepts along with those found in Section 3: Recognize Prevalent
Character of Existing Development.
a. New Construction
To be compatible with its historic environment, new construction should
respect established design patterns within the area of influence.
Standards
a. Build a new structure to the rear of a historic building
where it will have little or no impact on the streetscape.
b. If the new building will be visible from the street, respect
the established setbacks and orientations of the historic
buildings.
c. Landscaping associated with a new structure should be
compatible with that of the surrounding area.
d. New construction should reference predominant design
characteristics that make an area distinctive in order to
achieve creative and compatible design solutions that are
more than mere imitations of existing buildings.
18
b. New Additions to Historic Buildings
Property owners considering making an addition to a historic building should
ask themselves three questions:
 Does the proposed addition preserve the significant historic materials and
features?
 Does the proposed addition preserve the historic character of the building
and the surrounding historic district?
 Does the proposed addition protect the historical significance of the building
by making a visual distinction between old and new?
Standards
a. Additions to historic buildings should not be placed on the
main historic facade or facades of the building. Locate the
proposed addition away from the principal public view,
ideally to the rear of the building.
b. Respect the proportions of the building to which an
addition is being added so that the addition does not
dominate its historic environment.
c. Do not obscure character-defining features of a historic
building with an addition.
d. Set an additional story well back from the roof edge to
ensure that the historic buildings proportions and profile
are not radically changed.
e. Additions should respect the character and integrity of
original buildings and incorporate design motifs that
relate it to the historic building. They should always be of
quality workmanship and materials.
f. An addition should be designed so that at a later date it
could be removed without compromising the character of
the historic building.
g. While the addition should be compatible, it is acceptable
and appropriate for the addition to be clearly discernible
as an addition rather than appearing to be an original part
of the building. Consider providing some differentiation in
material, color, and/or detailing and setting additions
back from the historic buildings wall plane.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL
REHABILITATION STANDARDS
Section 1. Purpose and Intent.
Following are rehabilitation Standards specific to Newnans commercial and
industrial buildings. These Standards provide guidance to property owners in
making sound decisions when planning and carrying out a rehabilitation
project as well as providing technical information regarding historic materials
and appropriate rehabilitation methods.
The Standards are illustrated by specific examples from Newnan. Each
example has a caption that explains what is appropriate or not appropriate.
Appropriate examples are accompanied by a +. Inappropriate examples are
accompanied by an -.
20
Section 2. STOREFRONTS
The elements and arrangement of the first-floor storefront space identifies a
building as a commercial enterprise open to the public. A storefront consists
of specific elements such as large glass windows for displaying merchandise
and an entrance that may be recessed to provide a covered entry for the
customer. Transom windows are often placed across the top of the display
windows to allow more light into the interior retail space. A storefront cornice
tops the storefront and divides it from the upper facade.
Storefronts typically are the location of the majority of alterations and
modernizations made to commercial buildings. Particularly during the 1960s
and 1970s, the replacement of older wood storefronts with contemporary
aluminum-frame elements was popular. The storefronts of the 1940s and
1950s that were given a more modern and streamlined look with materials
such as Carrara glass, metal frames, and glass block are now or will soon be
historic.
Standards
a. Retain original elements and their arrangement when
rehabilitating an intact storefront.
b. If the original storefront has been partially or completely
removed, reconstruction of the storefront should be based
on historical, pictorial, or physical documentation.
c. If no documentation or evidence of the original storefront
can be found, the new storefront design should have
elements compatible with the size, scale, materials, and
arrangement of similar historic storefronts.
d. Historic storefront additions that have become significant
should be preserved.
e. Historic storefronts should not be covered with materials
that hide character-defining elements and their
arrangement; the removal of these non-historic materials
is encouraged.
21
+The storefronts in this building
retain their original arrangements
including cast-iron columns,
display windows, transoms, and
entrances.
+This storefront retains its
recessed entrance, large display
windows, wood-paneled bulkheads,
and multi-pane transom.
+This corner storefront retains its
distinctive angled entrance and
corner support column as well as
its display windows.
22
-This buildings originally open
glass storefront has been
completely in-filled with solid
materials.
-This street-level storefront space
has been in-filled with solid wall
materials punctuated only by single
windows and doors.
-This storefront has been covered
with inappropriate materials.
23
Section 3. ENTRANCES
Besides storefronts, commercial buildings have other types of entrances on
their street-level facades that provide a welcoming introduction to the
business establishment within. These may include the entrance to a lobby or
the stairway entrance leading to a buildings upper floors.
Standards
a. Retain original first- and second-floor entrances and their
configurations when rehabilitating a buildings intact
facade(s).
b. Original entrances should not be covered or in-filled.
c. If replacement or reconstruction of entrance area doors,
windows, and details is required, the replacement
features should be compatible in size, scale, materials,
and arrangement to original or similar historic features.
+This entrance retains its arched
transom, wood door frame, and
double wood doors.
24
+This entrance retains its double woodand-
glass doors; the shutters are an
added non-historic feature.
+Although it may no longer be
used, this arched entrance retains
its original wood door.
+/-The entrance on the left retains its
original door and transom; the entrance
on the right has been replaced with an
inappropriate anodized aluminum door,
frame, and transom.
+/-This arched entranceway remains
intact but its door and transom have
been replaced.
25
Section 4. UPPER FLOOR SPACE
The upper floors of commercial buildings typically contain private spaces such
as offices, storage areas, and sometimes residential living space. Rows of
windows distinguish this upper-floor use from the first-floor public storefront
space. The upper part of a commercial buildings facade is often the location
of stylistic details such as decorative window hoods, pilasters, and cornices.
Upper facades, like storefronts, often fall victim to modernization and the
loss of their distinctive features and materials.
Standards
a. Upper floors should not be covered with materials that
obscure the facades character-defining elements and
their arrangement.
b. Removal of non-historic materials covering original or
historic upper facades is encouraged.
c. Upper-floor window openings should not be in-filled with
any non-historic permanent materials.
d. Decorative features and stylistic details of upper facades
should be retained.
+This intact upper facade retains
its decorative cornice, window
hoods, and double-hung wood
windows.
+This upper facade retains its
distinctive round-arched windows.
26
+/-This upper facade retains its
double-hung windows and
distinctive details but has lost its
cornice.
-This historically brick upper
facade and its details have been
inappropriately covered with
stucco.
-This upper facade has been
completely covered with inappropriate
materials.
27
Section 5. ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS
Architectural details are usually focused on a commercial buildings primary
facade. These details include decorative window hoods and arches, pilasters,
cornices, brickwork, parapet walls, entrance surrounds, and other features
that show the influence of design and architectural style. These features help
define the distinctive character of each commercial building and reflect the
various periods of construction during which a commercial area developed.
Standards
a. Retain original architectural details on commercial
buildings and keep them well-maintained.
b. Removal of original details or application of details
inappropriate to the period or style of a building is
discouraged.
c. Repair rather than replace damaged elements whenever
possible; repair of damaged features should retain as
much original material as possible.
d. All replacement features should be of compatible design
to the original and documented by historical evidence.
+The brick corbelling on this
upper facade is a distinctive detail
that should be retained.
28
+This very decorative cornice is a
significant character-defining
feature of the 1895 Murray
Warehouse Block.
+The decorative grilles, brick
detailing, and pressed metal
cornice are important details on
this commercial building.
+The distinctive transom is an
important feature of this
storefront.
+The cast-iron grilles in this
bulkhead are significant details of
this storefront.
29
+Wide, arched openings and
loading docks are distinctive
features of industrial buildings that
should be retained.
+Stepped parapet walls are also
distinctive features of industrial
buildings.
30
Section 6. WINDOWS
Windows in historic commercial buildings provide light into upper floors and
help define a buildings character and style. Window openings that have been
covered or in-filled with a solid material give a blank appearance to a
building facade. When original windows have been replaced with
inappropriate substitutes, the character of a building changes.
Standards
a. Historic windows, including window sash, glass, lintels,
sills, frames, moldings, and all hardware should be
retained and repaired through routine maintenance
whenever possible.
b. When deteriorated window elements must be replaced,
new elements should be compatible with the original in
terms of materials, design, and hardware.
c. If it is necessary to replace an entire window, the
replacement should be sized to the original opening and
should duplicate the proportions and configurations of the
original window.
d. Upper-floor window openings should not be in-filled with
any non-historic permanent materials; restoration of infilled
windows to their historic appearance is encouraged.
+The wood, double-hung windows
in this buildings second floor
remain intact and provide light into
the interior.
+Industrial buildings generally
have metal-sash, multi-paned
windows with one section that
opens inward.
31
-This buildings original windows
have been replaced with
inappropriate metal-frame jalousie
windows.
-The windows of this upper facade
have been completely covered;
historic windows may remain intact
behind the plywood.
-Windows on side facades are also
important features of a commercial
building, particularly when the side
facade is on a prominent corner;
these windows have unfortunately
been covered.
32
Section 7. EXTERIOR MATERIALS
A variety of exterior materials was historically used on commercial buildings.
The majority of late-nineteenth- to mid-twentieth-century commercial
buildings were constructed of brick. Stone masonry construction was less
common. Stucco, terra cotta, and pressed metal were sometimes used as
exterior surface materials. Brick and stone as well as terra cotta, pressed
metal, and wood were also frequently used for decorative features and as
accent materials. Cast iron, wood, bronze, and Carrara glass were often
found on storefronts.
Standards
a. Preserve original exterior materials to the greatest extent
possible; work on these materials should be done with
care.
b. If replacement of historic materials is necessary, the new
materials should match the old in design, color, texture,
and other visual qualities; materials should be replaced in
kind whenever possible.
c. Avoid cleaning methods that damage original materials,
such as sandblasting.
d. The application of any exterior finish material, such as an
exterior insulating finishing system, to historic exterior
materials is strongly discouraged.
+Brick is the most common
exterior material for historic
commercial buildings; various
colors and sizes of brick dating
from different periods can be found
in many commercial areas.
+Stucco is sometimes used as an
exterior finish material.
33
+Stone, including granite and
marble, was often used as an
exterior finish material for banks.
+Pressed metal was often used
for decorative cornices.
+Corrugated metal may be found
on industrial buildings.
34
+Cast-iron columns are
used to support the weight
of upper floors.
+Materials such as terra
cotta were used for
decorative details.
35
Section 8. REPOINTING AND MASONRY REPAIRS
The vast majority of commercial buildings in Newnan are masonry
structurespredominantly brick. Although brick is one of the most durable
historic building materials, it is susceptible to damage due to harsh or
abrasive cleaning methods and to deterioration from excessive moisture. The
mortar used to bond the brick together is also very vulnerable to
inappropriate repair or maintenance techniques. Correct and timely
maintenance of masonry exteriors is vital to the structural health and
architectural integrity of historic masonry buildings.
Standards
a. Avoid cleaning methods that damage historic masonry,
such as sandblasting or harsh chemical treatments; use
the gentlest means possible when cleaning masonry.
b. Repointing of masonry joints should be undertaken only if
necessary.
c. When repair or replacement of old mortar is needed, the
new mortar should duplicate the old in strength,
composition, color, texture, and mortar joint width.
d. A new mortar with a high content of Portland cement
should not be used in repointing historic masonry joints,
unless that is the content of the historic mortar; Portland
cement can create a bond that is stronger than the
historic materials and can cause damage to the historic
masonry as the mortar expands and contracts with
temperature changes.
e. Appropriate repointing techniques and tools should be
used to avoid damage to historic masonry and masonry
joints.
f. Unpainted historic masonry should not be painted unless
it is severely damaged or deteriorated.
-This brick masonry has been
poorly repointed.
36
-This brick wall has been
sandblasted, removing the hard
outer coating of the bricks; in an
effort to stop deterioration, the
wall has also been painted.
+/-The upper portions of this
brick masonry appear to be in good
condition; however, the lower
portions have lost mortar and have
been poorly repointed.
37
Section 9. AWNINGS
Awnings were historically used on commercial buildings to provide protection
from the weather for both the customer and the storefront itself. They
continue to be used for this purpose today, as well as to provide a visual
enhancement for commercial building facades and an appropriate place for
signage.
Standards
a. Awnings placed over display windows are encouraged and
often are suitable locations for signage; they should be
mounted inside the storefront opening.
b. Canvas awnings are recommended; metal, bubble, and
shingled awnings are discouraged.
c. The design for a new awning should consider the color,
shape, and height of surrounding awnings as well as the
line other awnings create.
d. Historic awnings that lend character to a building should
be retained and repaired whenever possible.
+Canvas awnings are the most
appropriate awnings for historic
commercial buildings.
38
+Some metal awnings are now
becoming historic.
+A canvas skirt may be used to
cover a non-historic flat metal
awning.
-Solid, permanent awnings that
cover the transom and portions of
the storefront are not
recommended for historic
commercial buildings.
39
Section 10. ROOFS
The majority of commercial and industrial buildings have flat or very slightly
pitched roofs hidden by masonry parapet walls. A commercial buildings roof
form is a very important character-defining feature.
Standards
a. Maintain a buildings original roof form to the greatest
extent possible.
b. Roof additions that would be visible from the right-of-way
are discouraged; if an addition is necessary, it should be
placed away from a buildings prominent facades so as to
have minimum visual impact.
c. Historic roofing materials such as clay tile or standing
seam metal should be repaired rather than replaced;
parapet wall copings made of clay tile, terra cotta, or
similar materials should also be retained and repaired
whenever possible.
d. If replacement of historic roofing materials is necessary,
new materials should match as closely as possible the
scale, texture, and coloration of the historic roofing
materials.
+Most commercial buildings have
flat or slightly pitched roofs hidden
by masonry parapet walls; these
parapet walls are significant
character-defining features.
+Many industrial buildings have
slightly pitched roofs and stepped
parapet walls.
40
Section 11. REAR ENTRANCES AND SIDE FACADES
With the majority of attention focused on the front facades of commercial
and industrial buildings, rear entrances and side facades are often left
unkempt and forgotten. Rear and side entrance access, however, can be
attractive and convenient secondary entry points and advertisement
opportunities for a business.
Standards
a. Retain and respect historic entrances on the rear and side
facades; keep them well-maintained and attractive to
customers and employees.
b. New entrances on rear and side facades should be in
keeping with a buildings architectural style, details, and
materials.
+Side facades, particularly
on corner buildings, should
be as well-maintained as
front facades.
-This side facade has
unfortunately lost its firstfloor
entrances and
openings.
41
-These rear entrances
could be made much more
attractive and usable if they
were properly maintained.
42
Section 12. GUTTERS AND DOWNSPOUTS
Adequate roof drainage is necessary to (1) ensure that roofing materials
provide a weather-tight covering, and (2) prevent water from splashing
against walls or draining toward buildings. Inadequate drainage, including
missing and rusted gutters and downspouts, often leads to moisture damage
in masonry walls and deterioration of building features. Most commercial
building gutters are located behind masonry parapet walls and downspouts
are located on rear walls toward which the buildings flat or slightly pitched
roofs usually drain.
Standards
a. Gutters and downspouts should be maintained in their
original appearance and location.
b. Inspect existing gutters and downspouts frequently to
ensure they are unobstructed and that water is draining
away from the building.
c. If gutters and downspouts are deteriorated and need to
be replaced, new gutters and downspouts should be
similar to the original in materials and appearance.
+This gutter and
downspout system is wellmaintained.
43
Section 13. MECHANICAL SERVICES
Mechanical services are a necessary part of occupying a historic commercial
building. However, mechanical equipment should be placed at the rear or
side facade of a building, or even on a buildings roof, rather than at the front
facade.
Standards
a. Air conditioners and similar mechanical equipment should
be placed so as not to detract from the historical integrity
of a building.
b. The primary facade(s) of a building should not be
disrupted by the addition of mechanical services.
+This mechanical
equipment is appropriately
placed at the rear of these
commercial buildings.
?
.
44
Section 14. HISTORIC ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS
Additions and alterations may have been made to commercial buildings over
the years that are of quality workmanship and illustrate the evolution of
commercial design. This is especially true of storefronts, where new materials
and designs may have been introduced onto older commercial buildings to
modernize the storefronts. For example, the addition of Carrara glass
panels to storefronts was a popular treatment during the 1940s and 1950s.
These additions and alterations made during the historic period may have
become significant in their own right and worthy of preservation.
Standards
a. Historic additions and alterations that have acquired
significance in their own right, particularly storefront
additions, should be preserved.
+This storefront is probably not
original to the building but was
added at a later date and has
gained significance in its own right.
45
Section 15. NEW ADDITIONS TO HISTORIC COMMERCIAL
BUILDINGS
New additions to historic commercial buildings are not common and are
generally made to the rear of a building, especially on attached buildings in a
commercial row where space for expansion is limited.
Standards
a. Commercial building additions should be placed to the
rear of the building and should be compatible with the
existing structure.
b. The design of the addition should be clearly differentiated
so that the addition is not mistaken for part of the original
building.
c. The new addition should be designed so that a minimum
of historic materials and character-defining elements are
obscured, damaged, or destroyed.
?
?
+These additions have been
appropriately placed at the rear of
these commercial buildings.

INSTITUTIONAL REHABILITATION STANDARDS
_______________________________________________________
Section 1. Purpose and Intent
Section 2. Distinctive Features
Section 3. Alterations and Additions
Section 4. Adaptive Use
____________________________________________________________
INSTITUTIONAL REHABILITATION
STANDARDS
Section 1. Purpose and Intent.
Following are rehabilitation Standards for Newnans institutional buildings.
These structures include governmental buildings such as the county
courthouse, educational buildings such as neighborhood schools, and
religious buildings such as churches. Institutional buildings are visually
prominent landmarks that provide a unique community identity, and
appropriate rehabilitation work on these buildings can make a significant
impact on preserving the historic character of the district.
Many of the rehabilitation Standards in Section Two: Commercial and
Industrial Rehabilitation Standards may also be applied to institutional
buildings. Standards for such features as entrances, windows, exterior
materials, repointing and masonry repairs, roofs, and gutters and
downspouts are the same for both commercial and institutional buildings.
Institutional buildings, however, also have their own distinctive rehabilitation
issues.
47
Section 2. Distinctive Features
Institutional buildings are often the most stylistic buildings in a downtown
area, and many are architect-designed. Their distinctive architectural
features are, therefore, especially important to their design and integrity,
and every effort should be made to preserve these features.
Standards
a. Retain distinctive features that characterize historic
institutional buildings and make them visually prominent
landmark buildings.
b. Deteriorated features should be repaired rather than
replaced.
c. When replacement is required, new features should
match the old in design, color, texture, and where
possible, materials.
d. Replacement of missing features should be substantiated
by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
+The classical portico and cupola of the Coweta County Courthouse.
48
+The simplified
portico of the Municipal
Building.
+The pediment and
columns of the Newnan
Hospital portico.
+The distinctive
Corner entrance of the
Maggie Brown School
49
+The concrete portico
of one of the 1950s
elementary schools
+The distinctive
entrance to the high
school auditorium
+Most of the citys
religious buildings are
constructed of
masonry; this brick
façade has fine brick
detailing.
50
-This Gothic Revival-
Style church building
has distinctive
buttresses.
-Many of Newnans
churches have
distinctive towers.
51
Section 3. Alterations and Additions.
Alterations and additions to institutional buildings are often made to provide
more space and accommodate new needs.
Standards
a. Alterations and the placement of additions on institutional
buildings should be accomplished without compromising
the historic character of these structures.
b. Additions should not be placed on the front facade and
should have minimal visual impact from the public rightsof-
way.
c. Alteration of an institutional buildings front facade is
discouraged.
+ This addition to a
historic religious
building successfully
incorporates details of
the historic building
without copying it.
52
Section 4. Adaptive Use.
Historic institutional buildings may successfully accommodate new uses in
order to remain an active part of the community. Many institutional buildings
have large spaces that can be easily adapted for a number of compatible
uses. Newnan has several good examples of the adaptive use of historic
institutional buildings.
Standards
a. Proposed new uses for institutional buildings should be
compatible with the historic property so that minimal
changes are necessary.
b. Institutional buildings adapted for new uses shall retain
the distinctive features and historic character of their
original appearance and use.
Recommendation
 Interior space changes should have minimal impact on original materials
and floor plan. When at all possible, these changes should be temporary in
nature, allowing for future complete restoration of the interior space. If
original details and materials are removed, they should be retained and
stored for possible future replacement.

adjusted at the approval of the City Engineer and the Landscape Architect to
accommodate or preserve a specimen tree, provided however, that public access
easements are granted if the location of the sidewalk is moved off the public right
of way.

good state of repair by the owner, occupants, or agents in charge of the adjoining
property. A sidewalk in good repair shall be free of cracks, floats, obstructions,
7
depressions, and all other defects and shall have a uniform longitudinal and transverse
gradient.
2. All areas directly over sidewalks to a height of eight (8) feet shall be maintained free of
vegetative or other obstructions by the owner, occupants, or agents in charge of the

1. ARTERIALS
a) Urban principal arterial system-- serve the major centers of activity of a metropolitan
area, the highest traffic volume corridors, and the longest trip desires; and should carry a
high proportion of the total urban area travel on a minimum of mileage. The system should
be integrated, both internally and between major rural connections.
Because of the nature of the travel served by the principal arterial system, almost all fully
and partially controlled access facilities will be part of this functional system. In order to
preserve the identification of controlled access facilities, the principal arterial system is
stratified as follows:
14
1.Interstate Principal Arterial- those routes presently designated by the USDOT
as part of the Interstate System.
2.Urban Freeway and Expressway  limited-access urban arterials not on the
Interstate System
3.Urban Principal Arterial- uncontrolled or partial controlled access
b) Urban minor arterial street system-- The minor arterial street system should
interconnect with and augment the urban principal arterial system but provide service at a
lower level of mobility than urban principal arterials.
Urban Minor Arterial Street- provide service to trips of moderate length within an urban
area, and this system should distribute travel to geographic areas smaller than those
identified with the higher system. Such facilities may carry local bus routes and provide intracommunity
continuity but ideally should not penetrate identifiable neighborhoods. This
system should include urban connections to rural collector roads where such connections
have not been classified as urban principal arterials.
The spacing of minor arterial streets may vary from 1/8 - 1/2 mile in the central business
district to 2 - 3 miles in the suburban fringes, but should normally be not more than 1 mile
in fully developed areas.
2. COLLECTORS
Urban collector street system- The collector street system provides land access service and
traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods, commercial and industrial areas.
Urban Collector Street- collects traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods and
channels it into the arterial system. In the central business district, and in other areas of
like development and traffic density, the collector system may include the street grid which
forms a logical entity for traffic circulation.
3. LOCAL ROADS
Urban local street system- The local street system comprises all facilities not on one of the
higher systems
Urban Local Road-- serves primarily to provide direct access to abutting property and
access to the higher order systems. It offers the lowest level of mobility and usually
contains no bus routes. Service to through-traffic movement usually is deliberately
discouraged. Urban local roads constitute the urban public road mileage not classified as
part of the principal arterial, minor arterial, or collector systems inside of urban areas.

1. WALL - A solid structure that defines and sometimes protects an area. Most commonly, a wall
delineates a building and supports its superstructure, separates space in buildings into rooms,
or protects or delineates a space in the open air. There are three principal types of structural
walls: building walls, exterior boundary walls, and retaining walls. Building walls have two main
purposes: to support roofs and ceilings, and to divide space, providing security against
intrusion and weather. Boundary walls include privacy walls, boundary-marking walls, and city
walls. The conventional differentiation between a boundary wall and a fence is that a fence is
of minimal thickness and often is open in nature, while a wall is usually more than a nominal
thickness and is completely closed, or opaque. More to the point, if an exterior structure is
made of wood or wire, it is generally referred to as a fence, while if it is made of masonry, it is
considered a wall. Retaining walls are a special type of wall that may be either external to a
building or part of a building that serves to provide a barrier to the movement of earth, stone
or water. The ground surface or water on one side of a retaining wall will be noticeably higher
than on the other side.

be made to the latest edition of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, as
published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO).
Streets serving residential subdivisions shall be arranged and designed incorporating traffic
management and traffic calming methods in order to reduce traffic speeds, vehicle noise,
visual impact and through volumes in residential neighborhoods.
Requirements for Existing Streets When property proposed for development is
to be accessed from an existing City street, the extension of existing street shall be
continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the width
required for the designated street classification of the existing street, and shall meet
the minimum standards for the designated street classification of the existing street.
Existing Streets Widened
When property proposed for development fronts on an existing City street, the
developer shall cause to be constructed, at the developers expense,
improvements, including pavement, curb and gutter, drainage and traffic control
devices, to the existing street, along the entire property frontage, from the
centerline of the existing street along the side of the street upon which the
property abuts. Such improvements shall meet minimum standards for the
designated street classification of the existing street.
Existing Substandard Streets
For development having access to a substandard street and said substandard
street provides the primary means of access to the development, the substandard
street shall be fully upgraded and the full width of the roadway along the entire
property frontage, continuing to the nearest standard paved road along the route
of primary access, shall be paved with asphaltic concrete.
For development having access to a substandard street and said substandard
street provides other than primary means of access to the development, the
substandard sheet shall be fully upgraded only along the entire property frontage
30
equal or exceed the safe stopping sight distance along the major road of an
intersection.
f.
Dead End Streets - Dead end streets shall not be greater in length than five hundred
(500) feet, except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length
unavoidable, subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
1)
Permanent dead end street- shall be provided at the closed end with a Cul-de-sac
having a right-of-way radius of at least 60 feet and an outside pavement radius of
at least 50 feet not including curb and gutter. All other configurations must be
approved by the City Engineer. This dead end street may not subsequently be
extended through a platted subdivision lot originally served by it in order to serve
land adjoining that lot. A minimum distance of fifty (50) feet between roadway
radii centers shall be required.
2)
Temporary Cul-de-sac- A temporary dead end street may terminate at the
and shall be paved on the opposite side of the road from the development, with
asphaltic concrete, for a width not less than twelve (12) feet from the centerline of
the street.
a. Requirements of ZoningStreets shall meet all applicable requirements and
conditions of zoning including proffers as long as such requirements and conditions
meet generally acceptable safety and traffic movement standards according to the
Institute for Traffic Engineers (ITE).
b. Layout  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all
streets shall consider their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical
conditions, and appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the development to be
served by such streets.
c. Street NamesStreet names shall require the approval of Planning Department
and City Engineer, as well as 911 Emergency and the United States Post Office
(USPS). Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already existing and
named shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall
not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing streets.
Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections. Lettering on groundmounted
street name signs shall be six (6) inch upper-case letters. Lettering on
ground-mounted street name signs for multi-lane streets with speed limits greater
than forty (40) mph shall be eight (8) inch upper-case letters. Supplementary
lettering to indicate the type of street may be in smaller lettering three (3) inches
high. Street name signs shall have a white legend on a green background, unless
approved otherwise by the City Engineer. Street name signs shall be posted on
the same post with, and above, a stop or yield sign, as appropriate for the
intersection, unless approved otherwise by the City Engineer.
d. Street JogsStreet jogs with centerline offsets less than one hundred twenty-five
(125) feet shall not be permitted.
e. Site Distance- Intersections shall be designed such that safe stopping sight
distance shall be provided along intersection approach legs, and clear sight
triangles shall be provided along intersection approach legs and across their
included corners. The stopping sight distance and the distances of the legs of the
clear sight triangles shall be dependent on the design speeds of the intersecting
streets and the type of traffic control used at the intersection and shall be
determined using current AASHTO methods. Intersection sight distance shall
31
32
boundary of a subdivision or of a phase of a subdivision subject to the approval by
the Planning Commission. A temporary turnaround shall be provided and land
outside the normal right-of-way used for said turnaround shall revert to abutters at
such time the street is continued. Curb and gutter shall not be required for a
temporary Cul-de-sac. The radius dimension for roadway width for a temporary
Cul-de-sac shall be of the same dimension as for a permanent Cul-de-sac, less the
curb and gutter.
g. AlleysAlleys may be required at the rear of any lots used for mixed-use,
commercial, or industrial developments. Alleys may be provided in residential
developments as long as the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the
Planning Commission of the need for alleys.
h. Adjoining PropertyUnless an adjoining property owner agrees in writing, no new
street may be so located that the back-of-curb is within twenty (20) feet of the
property of said adjoining owner; except that this requirement shall not apply
where:
1) Such placement alone would render property on the opposite side of the
street from said adjoining owner too shallow to meet minimum
requirements of these Regulations; or
2) The remaining land is not wide enough to accommodate the required
street or right-of-way.
i. Traffic Control Devices - The selection of all appropriate traffic control devices and
the design, application and installation of appropriate traffic control devices,
including pavement marking, signing, and signaling devices, shall be according to
the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), as
published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Unless approved by the
City Engineer, the minimum size of regulatory and warning signs shall be as shown
in the MUTCD for conventional roads.
All Street name and traffic control devices shall be installed by the developer at the
developers expense. Ornamental posts and frames may be used within
developments, pending approval by the City Engineer, however all signs and
signals must conform to the latest edition of the MUTCD with incorporated revisions,
in relation to size, shape, color, materials and retro reflectivity requirements. The
City will not maintain or provide material replacement or credit for replacement of
non-standard and decorative posts, frames, and signs. If a decorative post and
sign requires maintenance or replacement, the city will only provide the standard
post and signage as a replacement option.
j. Roundabouts: Roundabouts shall be designed and constructed with raised concrete
splitter islands for deflection of approaching vehicles around the central island.
Roundabouts shall be designed and constructed with a flare or widening of the
approaches to allow for proper operation, and shall accommodate the design vehicle
appropriate for the streets intersecting at the roundabout. When crosswalk markings
are used within a roundabout, those markings shall be located a minimum
of twenty five (25) feet upstream from the yield point of entry.
k. Improvements along State and Federal Highways  For any development which
abuts a State or Federal highway, improvements to the highway and the location
and design of any street or driveway providing access from the highway shall comply
with the current standards, regulations, and requirements of the Georgia
Department of Transportation for Driveway and Encroachment Control. A copy of
33
the approved Georgia DOT permit shall be provided to the City prior to issuance of
any building permits.
6. Street Design Requirements
General Requirements for Streets
The three functional systems for urbanized areas are 1) a) urban principal arterials, b) minor
arterial streets, 2) collector streets, and 3) local streets. The differences in the nature and intensity
of development between rural and urban areas require these systems to have characteristics that
are somewhat different from the correspondingly named rural classifications.
a. ARTERIALS
1) Urban principal arterial system-- serve the major centers of activity of a
metropolitan area, the highest traffic volume corridors, and the longest trip
desires; and should carry a high proportion of the total urban area travel on a
minimum of mileage. The system should be integrated, both internally and
between major rural connections.
Because of the nature of the travel served by the principal arterial system, almost
all fully and partially controlled access facilities will be part of this functional system.
In order to preserve the identification of controlled access facilities, the principal
arterial system is stratified as follows:
(a) Interstate Principal Arterial- those routes presently designated by the USDOT
as part of the Interstate System.
(b) Urban Freeway and Expressway  limited-access urban arterials not on the
Interstate System.
(c) Urban Principal Arterial- uncontrolled or partial controlled access.
2) Urban minor arterial street system-- The minor arterial street system should
interconnect with and augment the urban principal arterial system but provide
service at a lower level of mobility than urban principal arterials.
Urban Minor Arterial Street- provide service to trips of moderate length within an
urban area, and this system should distribute travel to geographic areas smaller
than those identified with the higher system. Such facilities may carry local bus
routes and provide intra-community continuity but ideally should not penetrate
identifiable neighborhoods. This system should include urban connections to rural
collector roads where such connections have not been classified as urban principal
arterials.
The spacing of minor arterial streets may vary from 1/8 - 1/2 mile in the central
business district to 2 - 3 miles in the suburban fringes, but should normally be not
more than 1 mile in fully developed areas.
b. COLLECTORS
Urban collector street system- The collector street system provides land access
service and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods, commercial and
industrial areas.
Urban Collector Street- collects traffic from local streets in residential
neighborhoods and channels it into the arterial system. In the central
business district, and in other areas of like development and traffic density, the
34
collector system may include the street grid which forms a logical entity for traffic
circulation.
c. LOCAL ROADS
Urban local street system- The local street system comprises all facilities not on
one of the higher systems
Urban Local Road-- serves primarily to provide direct access to abutting property and access to the
higher order systems. It offers the lowest level of mobility and usually contains no bus routes.
Service to through-traffic movement usually is deliberately discouraged. Urban local roads
constitute the urban public road mileage not classified as part of the principal arterial, minor
arterial, or collector systems inside of urban areas.
Minimum Street Right-of-Way
Street Classification
sac
Right-of-Way (feet)
Principal Arterial 100
Minor Arterial 80
Principal Collector 80
Minor Collector 60
Local Residential 50
Local Residential Cul-de- 50 Radius
Local Non-Residential 60
Local Non-Residential Cul-de-sac 60 Radius
For any street proposed with a median, the minimum right-of-way increases in proportion to the median width.
d. Cross Sectional Elements 
Lane width: To provide a minimum level of service, the typical lane width shall be
twelve (12) feet. For local streets with two lanes of traffic, the minimum lane width
35
may be reduced to eleven (11) feet when incorporating traffic calming methods,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
For single lane, one-way local streets, in order to provide a ten (10) foot lane for
moving traffic and eight (8) feet for parking, the minimum roadway width shall be
twenty-two (22) feet, back of curb to back of curb.
Cross Slope: The cross slope for lanes on a normal crown section shall be one
quarter (1/4) inch per foot sloped towards the outer edge of pavement. The cross
slope shall be adjusted where superelevation requirements are incorporated into
the design for transitions from/to normal crown at each end of horizontal curves, in
accordance with the design standards of the Georgia Department of Transportation.
Street Grades, Horizontal Alignment, Tangent Sections, and Vertical Alignment 
Design criteria for street grades, horizontal alignment, tangent sections, and vertical
alignment shall be in accordance with the design standards of the Georgia
Department of Transportation and for design criteria not specifically addressed by
Ordinance of the City of Newnan or the latest standard specifications of the Georgia
Department of Transportation, reference shall be made to the latest edition of A
Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, as published by the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).
d. Turning Lanes, Deceleration Lanes and Acceleration Lanes
Turning lanes, deceleration lanes and acceleration lanes shall be provided to meet
projected traffic demands or as the need may be identified from a traffic study, or
as determined by the City Engineer. The minimum length and width of such lanes
shall be in accordance with the design standards of the Georgia Department of
Transportation.
e. Street Intersections Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as
possible. No street intersection shall be at an angle of less than eighty (80)
degrees, unless approved by the City Engineer
Curb Line Radii - The curb line radius at all intersections shall be at least fifteen
(15) feet. Where the angle of intersection is less than ninety (90) degrees, a
longer radius may be required. For streets with heavy traffic volumes, the curb
line radius may be extended to between fifteen (15) feet and twenty five (25) feet
for passenger vehicles and between thirty (30) feet and fifty (50) feet for trucks,
provided there are no significant pedestrian conflicts. The effective turning radius
for the design vehicle appropriate for the intersection being designed shall be
considered. Also the designer shall consider the smallest radius that will
accommodate vehicular traffic while avoiding narrowing sidewalks at corners and
increasing the length of pedestrian crosswalks.
f. Median Widths The minimum width for medians providing separation of opposing
directions of the traveled way shall be twenty (20) feet, measured between the
edges of traveled way, including left shoulders, if any, or as may be designated in
the Comprehensive Plan for the City of Newnan, or as approved by the City
Engineer.
Medians which may provide a refuge area for pedestrian crossings shall be convex
or raised medians and shall incorporate standard curb and gutter. The pedestrian
crossing through the median shall meet all current requirements of the Georgia
Department of Transportation for safety and accessibility.
7. Block Requirements
Block lengths and widths shall be as follows:
a. LengthPrimarily non-residential blocks including MXD, PDC, PDO, and PDI shall be
not greater than thirteen hundred (1300) feet nor less than six hundred (600) feet
in length; Residential blocks shall not be greater than eight hundred (800) feet in
length nor less than two hundred (200) feet in length; Primarily residential blocks in
PD, MXD, and OS districts shall not be greater than five hundred (500) feet in length
nor less than two hundred (200) feet in length.
b. WidthBlocks shall be wide enough to provide two (2) tiers of lots of minimum
depth, except where fronting on major streets, limited access highways or railroads,
or where other situations make this requirement impracticable.
c. Connections--Roads shall connect to form complete blocks wherever practicable.
This requirement is subject to a variance where the topography or other physical
limiting factor may be present.
8. Lot Requirements
a. Conventional Lots
1). Lot, Flag  No flag lots may be hereinafter platted in the City of Newnan.
Any flag lot existing at the time of adoption of this Ordinance shall not be
further subdivided, unless the new lots created conform to City Ordinance.
2). Lot SizeLot size for residential and for non-residential lots shall be as
required by the Zoning Ordinance.
3). Lot LinesAll lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for the additional
side yard width adjoining the street (unless a variation from this rule will
give a better street or lot plan).
4). Lots Abutting Public StreetsEach lot shall abut upon a dedicated public
street unless otherwise provided by these regulations.
5). Lot Depth - Excessive depth in relation to width is to be avoided, with a
ratio of 3:1 considered as the desirable maximum and a ratio of 5:1 being
the definite maximum. Lots shall only exceed the desirable maximum of 3:1
when the area used to create the additional depth would not otherwise be
better suited as common open space and would not create a conflicting
situation with adjoining land uses; or topographical conditions on the lot
warrant additional depth for building purposes. (10/24/2000)
b. Townhouse or Attached-Dwelling Lots
1) Lot SizeThe lot size for each dwelling unit shall be as required by the
Zoning Ordinance.
2) Lot LinesLot lines between attached dwelling units shall be extended in a
straight line, perpendicular to the front face of the building, to the
intersecting street right-of-way line. These lot lines shall also be
perpendicular to street lines or, where the street line is curved, shall be as
nearly radial to the street line as possible. Other lot lines shall be
36
37
perpendicular to building walls for a distance of at least ten (10) feet from
said walls but thereafter may be angled as necessary and prudent.
3) Lots Abutting Public StreetsEach lot shall abut upon a dedicated public
street.
4) Common AreasParking lots, driveways, alleys, and other areas which
must be used by several lot-owners and any additional areas not included
in individual lots shall be owned in common by said lot-owners, and such
areas shall be maintained by the tenants-in-common as directed by
required covenants.
c. Re-Subdivision After Sale of Lots
Re-subdivision to reduce lot size in all or part of a subdivision shall not be permitted
where such an increase in density would adversely affect lots already sold; nor shall
lot size in later phases of a subdivision be less than in previous phases, where such
an increase in density would adversely affect lots already sold in previous phases.
9. Development Along a Major Arterial Street/Principal Arterial Street
Where a subdivision abuts or contains a major arterial or principal arterial street, the
Planning Commission may require that access to such street be limited by one of the
following means:
a. The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the major arterial or principal arterial
street and front onto a parallel local street; no access being provided from the
major arterial or principal arterial street, and screening being provided in a strip of
land along the rear property line of such lots.
b. A series of cul-de-sacs, u-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed
generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their
terminal lots backing onto the major arterial or principal arterial street.
c. A marginal access or service road, separated from the major arterial or principal
arterial street by a planting strip and having access thereto at suitable points.
d. Where a minor street intersects the major arterial or principal arterial street,
corner lots of such dimensions that the front of the lot will be on the minor street.
10. Reserve Strips
Reserve strips controlling access to streets, alleys, and public grounds shall not be
permitted unless their control is placed in the hands of the City Council, under conditions
approved by the Planning Commission.
11. Easements
a. Utility LinesEasements having a minimum width of ten (10) feet and located
along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided as required for utility lines.
b. DrainageWhere a subdivision is traversed by a sanitary sewer or piped storm
sewer, there shall be provided a public maintenance easement of not less than 20
feet in width, centered along the centerline of the pipe and extending 10 feet
beyond the end of the pipe. Wider easements may be required as needed for
larger diameter pipes, as determined by the City Engineer.
38
c. Public Service AccessIn townhouse and attached-dwelling subdivisions,
easements contiguous with common areas and such other easements as are
determined to be necessary by the City shall be provided to assure access to each
lot for provision of public services and other services provided by franchise from
the City.
12. Improvements Required
a. RequiredEvery subdivider shall be required to install or to have installed by the
appropriate agency at his expense the following street improvements and utilities,
which shall be designed and submitted to the City as part of the engineering plan:
1) Provide street grading, curbs and gutters, and street paving.

street intersections and at each end of all curves. They shall be spaced so as to be
within sight of each other, the sight lines being contained wholly within the street
limits.
b. External BoundariesThe external boundaries of a subdivision shall be
monumented. These monuments shall be placed at all corners, at each end of all
curves, at the point where a curve changes its radius, at all angle points in any
line, and at all angle points along the meander line, said points to be not less than
twenty (20) feet back from the bank of any stream, except that when such corners
or points fall within a street, or proposed future street, the monuments shall be
placed in the side line of the street.
c. Internal BoundariesAll internal boundaries and those corners and points not
referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be monumented in the field by iron
pipes at least one (1) inch in diameter or by iron bars at least five-eights (5/8)

size of regulatory and warning signs shall be as shown in the MUTCD for conventional roads.
The maintenance of all traffic control devices on private streets shall be included in the
maintenance agreement.
a. The use of private streets is appropriate only when their use will, with innovative
site design, provide more usable open space, better recreational opportunities or
safer and more attractive neighborhoods and developments than would be
permitted under standard zoning and development techniques.
b. The use of private streets shall not be used as a refuge from standard zoning and
other development techniques in order to obtain higher overall densities.
c. In order for the streets to be classified as private, the street or street system must
be entirely self-contained within a particular planned subdivision, cluster or
development.
d. Private streets are only appropriate when their use shall not restrict or
unreasonably reroute the extension of existing or proposed collector and local
streets.
e. The street cannot function as a private street if its alignment will encourage short
cutting or detouring from one public street another.
f. The street cannot function as private if it is designed or planned by either the
developer or the City to handle traffic from one subdivision, cluster or development
through another subdivision, cluster or development.
g. Private streets shall only be considered for developments of twenty-five (25) lots
or less.
h. All residential units must be located within 1,000 feet of a publicly dedicated street.

private street or alley pavement.
c. At the intersection of a driveway with the curb line of a public street, a minimum
curb-line radius shall be formed on each side as per Section 11, sub-section 6. 3
(c) above.
d. Angle. The angle of a driveway shall be such that no vehicle will have to make
deflection of greater than 90 degrees when entering or leaving the property, but
in no case shall the angle be less than 45 degrees.
e. Tie-in type. A street-intersection type tie-in shall be provided wherever ditch
drainage is used and where otherwise made necessary by the level of driveway
traffic. A concrete valley gutter tie-in shall be provided to a street with curb and
gutter and piped storm drainage. If a street-intersection type tie-in is preferred by
the property owner, catch basins must be provided to channel gutter flow into the
41
storm drainage system.
f. Grade. On streets with ditch drainage along the street and a street-intersection
type tie-in, the driveway shall slope downward and away from the road surface at
a rate not less than one-half inch in one foot out to the ditchline. Driveway grade
for a concrete valley gutter tie-in shall conform to standards of the City.
g. Drainage. Curb inlets shall be designed for a 10-year storm. Driveway pipes shall
be designed for a 25-year storm unless a larger pipe is emptying into the ditch that
leads to the driveway pipe. Pipes 48 inches in diameter and larger shall have an
inlet and outlet headwall. Pipes smaller than 48 inches shall have at least a flared
end section. All structures and materials shall meet City standards.
h. Adjacent slope. No new slope to be placed on the right-of-way shall be steeper
than 4:1 (horizontal: vertical ) sloping from the street or 2:1 sloping from the
driveway.
3. Curb Cuts
a. Length. The length of a curb cut shall be the sum of driveway width plus the
radius on each side.
b. Separation, two-way driveways. Distance between two-way driveways (not
including radii), for driveways on the same lot and on the same street frontage,
shall be at least 100 feet (except that for a service station or convenience store
which includes gasoline sales and has at least 150 feet of frontage, the minimum
distance shall be fifty feet). Lots not wide enough to meet this and related
driveway placement requirements may have only a single two-way driveway.
c. Separation, one-way driveways. Where one-way driveways are used, the exit from
the property shall be downstream - in the direction of traffic flow - from the
entrance. Distance between driveways (not including radii) on the same lot and
on the same street frontage shall be at least fifty (50) feet on collector streets and
eighty (80) feet on arterial streets.
d. Number of driveways. On a collector or and arterial street, no lot with less than
300 feet of frontage shall have more than one two-way driveway or two one-way
driveways (except that a service station or convenience store which includes
gasoline sales and has at least 150 feet of frontage may have two two-way
driveways); no lot with less than 1000 feet of frontage shall have more than two
two-way driveways; and a lot with frontage of 1000 feet or more may have
driveways as determined on a case-by-case basis by the City Engineer.
e. Distance from property lines. No curb cut may extend across an extended property
line, except a curb cut for a joint driveway; and no curb cut shall be within four (4)
feet of an extended property line or within two (2) feet of a property line within
lots that have frontage on a cul-de-sac.
f. Distance from intersections. On a local street, no driveway shall be permitted
within fifty (50) feet of an intersection with another street. On a collector street,
no driveway shall be permitted within ninety (90) feet of an intersection with
another street. On an arterial street, no driveway shall be permitted within 120
feet downstream or ninety (90) feet upstream of an intersection with another
street. At signalized intersections on collector or arterial streets, respective
distances shall be increased by 100 feet. Exceptions may be granted where the
City Engineer determines that (1) there is no reasonable alternative and (2) traffic
capacity and safety would not be significantly affected.
42
g. Subdivision of arterial street frontage. On an arterial street, where a tract of land
is subdivided after the adoption of this provision such that a lot with less than 150
feet of frontage is created, access to such lot shall be from either:
1) A driveway serving the remainder of the tract from which the lot was cut,
2) A joint driveway,
3) A frontage road, or
4) if a corner or double-frontage lot, an adjacent non-arterial street.
h. General location criteria. Unless substantially constrained by topography or the
needs of internal traffic circulation of the property, driveways shall be located so as
to maximize distance between driveways along the street section, maximize the
length of deceleration lanes, and minimize conflict with other features of the street
section.
i. Traffic channeling structures. No median, island, or other traffic channeling
structure may be installed in a driveway entrance without approval of the City
Engineer. Upon approval, the permitted length of the curb cut may be increased
to accommodate such structures.
j. Pull-off parking. Limitations on length of curb cut shall not apply to pull-off parking
where such parking is otherwise permitted.
4. Curb and gutter
a. Required. Where there is existing curb and gutter on the public street, curb and
gutter shall be constructed for a driveway entrance. Where there is no curb and
gutter on the public street, it shall be constructed for a driveway entrance where
one of the following conditions occurs:
1) A new non-residential use of multi-family (three or more
dwelling units) or other residential use utilizing a common
driveway entrance for three (3) or more dwelling units is
established on previously vacant land.
2) A non-residential use is established on land previously in residential use.
3) The number of dwelling units on a lot is increased to three (3) or more.
4) Changes to developed property, such as the piping and covering of
ditches, result in uncontrolled access to the public street.
b. Length. Where curb and gutter is required by the above conditions, the length of
curb and gutter to be constructed shall be determined as follows:
1) Curb and gutter shall be used to construct the radii where
the driveway intersects the public street and, for streetintersection
type tie-ins, shall extend along the driveway
to the right-of-way line.
2) Except where tapers for acceleration or deceleration lanes
are present, curb and gutter shall be extended by the
property owner at least twenty (20) feet in each direction
43
along the public street from the end of each radius section
(except that no property owner shall be required to
extend curb and gutter along the street beyond an
extended property line).
3) Where changes to developed property result in
uncontrolled access to the public street, curb and gutter
shall be provided along the entire frontage of the
property.
c. Distance from centerline-All Streets Excluding Local Residential. Distance from the
centerline of the public street to the edge of the curb and gutter shall be adequate
for provision of 12-foot travel lanes, including future lanes indicated on official
maps or ordinances of the City. Where a left-turn lane to serve both sides of the
street will be necessary and the City has adopted plans to construct such lane, an
additional six (6) feet of lane width shall be provided by the property owner.
Where a median with a left-turn lane will be necessary to serve a particular
development, an additional sixteen (16) feet of lane width shall be provided by the
property owner.
d. Distance from centerline- Local Residential Streets. Distance from the centerline of
the public street to the edge of the curb and gutter shall be adequate for provision
of 11-foot travel lanes, including future lanes indicated on official maps or
ordinances of the City.
e. Right-of-way dedication. Any additional right-of-way necessary for construction of
curb and gutter and the accommodation of utilities shall be dedicated to the City
by the property owner.
f. Storm drainage. Storm drainage from curb and gutter sections constructed by a
property owner shall be discharged at locations and through structures approved
by the City Engineer.
5. Acceleration and Deceleration Lanes
a. Required. At the driveways providing access to a non-residential use or a multifamily
(three (3) or more dwelling units) or other residential use utilizing a
common driveway entrance for three (3) or more dwelling units on an arterial
street, acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be constructed by the property
owner in conjunction with the curb and gutter required above, and the length of
curb and gutter shall be increased to the full length of such lanes. An acceleration
lane shall not generally be required, but the driveway radius shall turn out as
though a lane were to be provided and a taper shall be constructed. An
acceleration lane shall be required where (a) the owner's property extends to an
intersection with a collector or arterial street within 150 feet of the driveway in the
direction of traffic flow, or (b) the required taper will merge with the taper of an
existing deceleration lane or is within twenty (20) feet of merging.
b. Length. Each such lane shall be 150 feet in length, with an additional tapered
transition section 50 feet in length. Lane pavement width shall be 12 feet. Where
the taper of a new deceleration lane will merge with the taper of an existing
driveway or is within twenty (20) feet of merging, the deceleration lane shall be
extended to that driveway.
c. Property lines. Where a lane or taper would merge with a lane or taper provided
for adjoining property or would encroach on the corner radius of a street
intersection, an altered design may be approved by the City Engineer. Where a
44
lane or taper would extend across an extended property line, such lane or taper
shall be constructed if there is adequate right-of-way in front of the adjoining
property.
d. Right-of-way dedication. Any additional right-of-way necessary for construction of
a lane and the abutting curb and gutter and the accommodation of utilities shall be
dedicated to the City by the property owner.
e. Exceptions. The following land uses are exempted from the requirement for
acceleration/deceleration lanes:
1) Warehouse use with less than 10,000 sq. ft. of building
area.
2) Manufacturing use with less than 13,000 sq. ft. of building
area.
3) Other light industrial use with less than 7,000 sq. ft. of
building area.
4) Other heavy industrial use with less than 33,000 sq. ft. of
building area.
5) Apartment development with fewer than nine (9) dwelling
units.
6) Nursing home with fewer than nineteen (19) beds.
7) Medical office use with less than 1,000 sq. ft. of building
area.
8) General office use with less than 3,000 sq. ft. of building
area.
9) Office park (mixed office uses) with less than 2,000 sq. ft.
of building area.
A mixture of the above uses will require a case-by-case determination of traffic generation
by the City Engineer. Acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be required when sufficient
additional development occurs on property previously exempted from the requirement.
6. Left-Turn Restrictions
On arterial streets, left turns shall be prohibited to and/or from driveways by the
construction of approved channeling structures under the following conditions:
a. Inadequate corner clearance.
b. Inadequate sight distance.
c. Inadequate driveway spacing.
d. Site has a signalized driveway on the same arterial at which left
turns can be made.
e. Other capacity, delay, or safety conditions make specific left turns
dangerous.
45
7. Paving
Driveways shall be paved to the right-of-way line. Acceleration and deceleration lanes and
gaps between existing pavement and new curb and gutter shall also be paved. Pavement
structure shall at least match that of the adjoining existing pavement and shall not be less
than specified in writing or drawings by the City Engineer. Materials and construction
methods shall meet City standards.
8. Administrative Standards
The City Engineer may establish standards (in writing or in drawings) for structures and
approve driveway access designs permitted by these regulations but not specified herein;
and establish such additional standards (in writing or in drawings) as are necessary to
clarify these regulations and assure traffic safety and protection of traffic capacity on the
public streets.
Section 13. Standard Development Details.
The City of Newnan will maintain on file for consultation and distribution a series of
standard drawings and details illustrating standard design and details of construction of
streets and roadways, including drainage facilities for land development.
The standard drawings and details illustrate minimum acceptable standards for design and
construction associated with land development activities for streets, drainage facilities and
other infrastructure improvements. These minimum standards shall not supersede more
restrictive prudent design requirements or good engineering practice as applied to specific
situations.
Unless otherwise specially set forth in this code or the Design and Construction Standards
and Details, all the materials, methods of construction, and workmanship for the work
covered in reference to street construction and storm drainage construction shall conform to
the latest standard specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation.
For design criteria not specifically addressed by Ordinance of the City of Newnan or the
latest standard specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation, reference shall
be made to the latest edition of the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
