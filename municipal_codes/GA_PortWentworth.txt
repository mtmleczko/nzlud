PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Port Wentworth of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    This 2008 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 06-17, adopted June 22, 2006, and was accomplished under the supervision of Diana Ossi, Editor. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations setting forth their location within the Code volume is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 3 is 3-2. 
    Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The 1978 publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President and Roger D. Merriam, Editor of Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    Special appreciation is due to Mr. John T. Sparkman, Jr., City Attorney and Mr. Harold Bennett, City Clerk, for their cooperation and help in the preparation of this Code.

Sec. 2-53. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this article, to be known as "The Fiscal Control Ordinance of the City of Port Wentworth," is to provide for a system of financial administration, accounting, fiscal and budgetary control which conforms to generally accepted accounting practices. 
(Ord. No. 82-1, § 1, 2-11-82) 
Sec. 2-54. - Definitions. 
    Accrual basis. The basis of accounting under which revenues and recorded when earned or when levies are made, and expenditures are recorded as soon as they result in liabilities, notwithstanding that the receipt of the revenue or payment of the expenditure may take place, in whole or in part, in another accounting period. 
    Appropriation. An authorization granted by the legislative body to make expenditures or to incur obligations for specific purposes. 
    Appropriation balance. Unencumbered balance of appropriation or allotment, and unexpended balance of appropriation or allotment. 
    Assets. Property of all kinds of a government, including both current assets and fixed assets. 
    Audit. The examination of records, documents, reports, systems or internal control, accounting and financial procedures, and other evidence for one (1) or more of the following purposes: 
(a)	To ascertain whether the statements prepared from the accounts present fairly the financial position and the results of financial operations of the constituent funds and balanced account groups of the governmental unit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals applicable to governmental units and on a basis consistent with that of the preceding years; 
(b)	To determine the propriety, legality, and mathematical accuracy of a government unit's financial transactions; 
(c)	To ascertain whether all financial transactions have been properly recorded; and 
(d)	To ascertain the stewardship of public officials who handle and are responsible for the financial resources of a governmental unit. 
    Balance sheet. A statement ordinarily prepared from books kept by double entry showing assets, liabilities, reserves and surplus of a fund of a governmental unit at a specified date properly classified to exhibit financial position of the fund or unit at the date. 
    Budgetary control. The control or management of a governmental unit in accordance with an approved budget and keeping expenditures within the limitations of available appropriations or revenues. 
    Cash basis. The system of accounting under which revenues are accounted for only when received in cash, and expenditures are accounted for only when paid. 
    Contingent account. An appropriation to provide for unforeseen expenditures. 
    Current surplus. The excess of the current assets of a fund over its current liabilities and reserves. 
    Debit and credit. Terms commonly used to indicate the manner in which a transaction is to be recorded. Every entry on the left side of the ledger sheet is called a "debit." Every entry on the right side of the ledger sheet is called a "credit." We debit in order to record: 
(1)	An increase in expenditure or a decrease in revenue; 
(2)	A decrease in an asset; 
(3)	An increase in a liability. 
    Debt service. The amount of money necessary annually to pay the interest on the outstanding debt and the principal of maturing bonded debt not payable from a sinking fund and to provide a fund for the redemption of bonds payable from a sinking fund. 
    Delinquent taxes. Taxes remaining unpaid on and after the date on which a penalty for nonpayment is attached. Even though the penalty may be subsequently waived and a portion of the taxes may be abated or canceled, the unpaid balances continue to be delinquent taxes until abated, canceled, or converted into tax liens. 
    Encumbrances. Obligations in the form of purchase orders, contracts or salary commitments which are chargeable to an appropriation and for which a part of the appropriation is reserved. 
    Fund. A sum of money or other resources (gross or net) set aside for the purpose of carrying on specific activities or to attain certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions, or limitations. A fund is a distinct financial and legal entity. 
    Internal audit. An audit made by persons on the staff on the governmental unit whose accounts are being audited primarily for the purpose of internal control. Note: An internal audit is usually a continuous audit. 
    Liabilities. Liabilities are debts owed. 
    Millage. A term used to express the property tax rate and derived from the term "mill," which is one-tenth of a cent ($0.001). Thus, ten (10) mills equal one cent ($0.01) or one (1) per cent. 
0.001 = 1 mill or 1/10 cent 
0.010 = 10 mills or 1 cent = 1% 
0.100 = 100 mills or 10 cents = 10% 
Millage is determined by dividing the total amount of money to be raised by the total assessed value of the district. 
Example: 
Taxes needed       = $100,000 Assessed value       = $8,000,000 $100,000 
$8,000,000       = .0125 or 121/2 mills or 1.25%  
    Taxes receivable. The uncollected portion of taxes which a governmental unit has levied. 
    Trust funds. Amounts received or appropriated and held in trust in accordance with an agreement or legislative act which may be expended only in accordance with the terms of such trust or act.

(Ord. No. 01-03, 3-8-01) 
Sec. 2-70. - Investment policies and procedures. 
(1)	Scope. This investment policy applies to activities of the City of Port Wentworth with regards to investing the financial assets of its funds (the city does not manage its own pension trust fund). These funds are accounted for in the city's annual financial report and include: 
	General Fund 
	Special Revenue Funds 
	Capital Projects Funds 
	Propriety Funds 
	Other funds which may be created from time to time 
(2)	Objectives. The City of Port Wentworth's investment objectives in order of priority are: 
(a)	Safety of principal. Each investment transaction will be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk. The City of Port Wentworth will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by: 
1.	Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in subsection (6) of this investment policy; and 
2.	Diversifying the investment portfolio so that the losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio. 
Interest rate risk, the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will decrease due to changes in market interest rates, will be minimized by: 
1.	Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities prior to maturity; and 
2.	Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities, money market mutual funds, or similar investment pools and limiting the average maturity of the portfolio in accordance with this policy. 
(b)	Maintenance of adequate liquidity. The investment portfolio must be structured in such a manner that it provides sufficient liquidity to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands. 
(c)	Return on investment. The city seeks to attain market rates of return on its investments consistent with constraints imposed by its safety objectives, cash flow considerations and state laws that restrict the placement of certain public funds. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investment is limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall generally be held until maturity with the following exceptions: 
	A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal. 
	A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio. 
	Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold. 
(d)	Legality. The City of Port Wentworth's funds will be invested in compliance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4 and in accordance with these policies and written administrative procedures. 
(3)	Standards of care. 
(a)	Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy. 
The "prudent person" standard states that, "Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived." 
(b)	Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the City of Port Wentworth. 
(c)	Delegation of authority. The Port Wentworth City Council shall establish the overall investment policies, the management and implementation of which is delegated to the assistant city administrator, who shall establish procedures for the operation of the investment program. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the assistant city administrator. The assistant city administrator shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. 
(4)	Authorized financial institutions, depositories, and broker/dealers. It is the policy of the City of Port Wentworth to purchase securities only from those broker-dealers and banks that are included on the city's bid list as approved by the assistant city administrator. The approved list will be developed in accordance with these investment policies. 
    Repurchase agreements will be conducted only with those banks and broker-dealers who have executed a master repurchase agreement with the city. All repurchase agreements must be in written form using the Public Securities Association master repurchase agreement as a guide. Annex I of the guide shall materially conform to the recommendations by the Government Finance Officers Association. Agreements not substantially conforming to the master [repurchase agreement] and Annex I are not acceptable. 
    Broker/dealers will be required to sign a broker-dealer questionnaire certification. 
(5)	Safekeeping and custody. 
(a)	Delivery vs. payment. All trades of marketable securities will be executed by delivery vs. payment (DVP) to ensure that securities are deposited in an eligible financial institution prior to the release of funds. 
(b)	Safekeeping. Securities will be held by an independent third-party custodian selected by the entity as evidenced by safekeeping receipts in the City of Port Wentworth's name. 
(c)	Internal controls. The assistant city administrator is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the City of Port Wentworth are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal controls shall address the following points: 
1.	Control of collusion. Collusion is a situation where two (2) or more employees are working in conjunction to defraud their employer. 
2.	Separation of functions. By separating key functions and having different people perform each function, each person can perform a "check and balance" review of the other people in the same area. 
3.	Separation of transaction authority from accounting and recordkeeping. By separating the person who authorizes or performs the transaction from the people who record or otherwise account for the transaction, a good separation of duties is achieved. 
4.	Custodial safekeeping. Securities purchased from any bank or dealer, including appropriate collateral, should be placed into a third party bank for custodial safekeeping. 
5.	Avoidance of bearer-form securities. Bearer-form securities are much easier to convert to personal use than securities that are registered in the name of the City of Port Wentworth. 
6.	Avoidance of physical delivery securities. Book entry securities are much easier to transfer and account for since actual delivery is never taken. Physical delivery securities must be properly safeguarded as are any valuable documents. The potential of fraud and loss increases with physical delivery securities. 
7.	Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members. Subordinate staff members must have a clear understanding of their authority and responsibilities to avoid any improper actions. Clear delegation of authority also preserves the internal control structure that is built around the various staff positions and their respective responsibilities. 
8.	Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments and wire transfers. Due to the potential for errors and improprieties arising from telephone transactions, all telephone transactions should be supported by written communications and approved by the appropriate person. 
9.	Documentation of transactions and strategies. 
10.	Development of a wire transfer agreement with the city's lead bank. This agreement should outline the various controls and security provisions for making and receiving wire transfers. 
(6)	Suitable and authorized investments. The following investments will be permitted by this policy as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4: 
	Obligations of the State of Georgia or of other states. 
	U.S. Treasury obligations (bills, notes and bonds). 
	Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the United States government or a United States government agency. 
	Obligations of the following United States government agencies: 
-	Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB) 
-	Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) 
-	Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) or its banks 
-	Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) 
-	Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) participation certificates or debentures 
-	Student Loan Marketing Association 
	Repurchase agreements backed by the United States government or a government agency. 
	The local government investment pool. 
	Obligations of other political subdivisions of the State of Georgia. 
	Time deposits and savings deposits of banks organized under the laws of Georgia or the United States government and operating in Georgia. 
-	Savings accounts 
-	Money market accounts 
-	Certificates of deposits (nonnegotiable type) 
(7)	Investment parameters. 
(a)	Diversification. The investments shall be diversified by: 
1.	Limiting investments to avoid over concentration in securities from a specific issuer or business sector (excluding U.S. Treasury securities); 
2.	Limiting investment in securities that have higher credit risks; 
3.	Investing in securities with varying maturities; and 
4.	Continuously investing a portion of the portfolio in readily available funds such as local government investment pools (LGIPs), money market funds or overnight repurchase agreements to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in order to meet ongoing obligations. 
5.	No more than forty (40) per cent of the entire invested portfolio may be placed with any one (1) bank or security dealer. 
(b)	Maximum maturities. The longer the maturity of a particular investment, the greater its susceptibility to market price and credit losses. The city seeks to eliminate such risk by maintaining conservative maturities that are within guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). These guidelines generally recommend avoiding securities with maturities beyond five (5) years unless the investment is matched and held to a specific maturity. Investment maturities shall be scheduled to coincide with projected cash flow needs, taking into consideration large routine expenditures (i.e. payroll and bond payments) as well as anticipated revenues (i.e. property tax collections). 
(c)	Active secondary markets. Although many securities are acceptable for investing using the legal authorized list, some are not very desirable from a liquidity standpoint. Accordingly, although investments may be on the authorized list, only those securities with an active secondary market may be purchased from that list. 
(8)	Policy considerations. 
(a)	Exemption. Any investment currently held that does not meet the guidelines of this policy shall be exempted from the requirements of this policy. At maturity or liquidation, such monies shall be reinvested only as provided by this policy. 
(b)	Amendments. This policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis. Any changes must be approved by the assistant city administrator and the city council. 
(9)	Approval of investment policy. The investment policy shall be formally approved and adopted by the Port Wentworth City Council and reviewed annually. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(I-IX), 9-22-05) 
Sec. 2-71. - Homestead exemption. 
(1)	The mayor and council hereby increase the homestead exemption from ad valorem real property taxes levied by the City of Port Wentworth to forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00), notwithstanding the existence of any law or ordinance establishing a homestead exemption from municipal ad valorem taxes in a lesser amount. This exemption is in lieu of, and not in addition to, any other homestead exemption from municipal taxation. 
(2)	"Homestead" means the real property owned by and in possession of the applicant on January 1 of the taxable year and upon which the applicant resides including, but not limited to, the land immediately surrounding the residence to which the applicant has a right of possession under a bona fide claim of ownership. The term "homestead" includes the following qualifications: 
(a)	The actual permanent place of residence of an individual who is the applicant and which constitutes the home of the family;

(c)	Where the building is occupied primarily as a dwelling; 
(d)	Where the children of deceased or incapacitated parents occupy the homestead of their parents and one (1) of the children stands in the relation of applicant. This subparagraph shall apply whether or not the estate is distributed; 
(e)	Where a husband or wife occupies a dwelling and the title of the homestead is in the name of the wife; 
(f)	In the event a dwelling house which is classed as a homestead is destroyed by fire, flood, storm, or other unavoidable accident or is demolished or repaired so that the owner is compelled to reside temporarily in another place, the dwelling house shall continue to be classed as a homestead for a period of one (1) year after the occurrence; 
(g)	In the event an individual who is the applicant owns two (2) or more dwelling houses, he shall be allowed the exemption granted by law on only one (1) of the houses. Only one (1) homestead shall be allowed to one (1) immediate family group; 
(h)	Where property is owned and occupied jointly by two (2) or more individuals all of whom occupy the property as a home and if the property is otherwise entitled to a homestead exemption, the homestead may be claimed in the names of the joint owners residing in the home. Where the property on which a homestead exemption is claimed is jointly owned by the occupant and others, the occupant or occupants shall be entitled to claim the full amount of the homestead exemption; 
(i)	The permanent place of residence of an individual in the armed forces. Any such residence shall be construed to be actually occupied as the place of abode of such individual when the family of the individual resides in the residence or when the family is forced to live elsewhere because of the individual's service in the armed forces; 
(j)	Absence of an individual from his residence because of duty in the armed forces shall not be considered as a waiver upon the part of the individual in applying for a homestead exemption. Any member of the immediate family of the individual or a friend of the individual may notify the tax receiver or the tax commissioner of the individual's absence. Upon receipt of this notice, the tax receiver or tax commissioner shall grant the homestead exemption to the individual who is absent in the armed forces; 
(k)	The homestead exempted must be actually occupied as the permanent residence and place of abode by the applicant awarded the exemption, and the homestead shall be the legal residence and domicile of the applicant for all purposes whatever; 
(l)	In all counties having a population of not less than nineteen thousand two hundred (19,200) nor more than nineteen thousand seven hundred fifty (19,750), according to the United States decennial census of 2000 or any future such census, where the person who is the applicant holds real property subject to a written lease; the applicant has held the property subject to such a lease for not less than three (3) years prior to the year for which application is made; and the applicant is the owner of all improvements located on the real property; 
(m)	The deed reflecting the actual ownership of the property for which the applicant seeks to receive a homestead exemption must be recorded in the deed records of the county prior to the filing of the application for the homestead exemption; and 
(n)	Absence of an individual from such individual's residence because of health reasons shall not in and of itself be considered as a waiver upon the part of the individual in applying for a homestead exemption if all other qualifications are otherwise met. Any member of the immediate family of the individual or a friend of the individual may notify the tax receiver or the tax commissioner of the individual's absence. Upon receipt of this notice, the tax receiver or tax commissioner shall grant the homestead exemption to the individual who is absent for health reasons. 
(3)	The owner requesting a homestead exemption shall file an application with the city for determination of whether the owner is entitled to such exemption. The city shall provide the application forms. The exemption shall be automatically renewed from year to year as long as the owner of the property occupies the residence as a homestead. This exemption shall be in addition to other exemptions granted by the state or county. This ordinance may be amended at any time following the procedures for such amendment. 
(4)	The exemption established herein shall apply only to municipal ad valorem taxes.

(3)	Testing or having the underground storage tank and/or integral piping system tested in accordance with the provisions in subsection 5-179(E). 
(d)	When a leak occurs, the owner or operator shall remove the free-floating pollutant from the groundwater, remove any combustible or harmful vapors emitted from the pollutant, and ensure that the level of dissolved hydrocarbons in the water be no greater than declared acceptable for public health by the Georgia Department of Environmental Protection. 
(e)	Investigation of a leak shall commence within three (3) working days from the date of detection by the operator. Investigation shall be conducted by a qualified soil/groundwater investigation and pollutant analysis removal firm. In the investigation process, the owner or operator, through appropriate testing, shall determine the type of pollutant leaked, the limits of the leak accumulation and the quantity of leaked pollutant. 
(f)	The owner or operator shall submit to the city building inspector, within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date of detection, a pollutant removal and monitoring plan. This plan shall be developed by a qualified soil/groundwater investigation and pollutant analysis removal firm. Removal shall commence within twenty-five (25) calendar days from the date of detection by the owner or operator, unless extenuating circumstances dictate otherwise. The city building inspector shall decide if the extenuating circumstances warrant an extension of time. Where an extension of time is warranted, the city building inspector and the owner or operator shall agree on a time extension for the date of commencement of the removal operations. 
(g)	Whenever "owner" or "operator" is used conjunctively with the other and the parties have by agreement identified which party has the primary responsibility for compliance with this article and have filed, with the city building inspector, a written statement executed by both evidencing that agreement, the city shall deem the party assuming the primary responsibility as the party subject to compliance with this article. The party assuming the primary responsibility can also sign the appropriate space furnished by the underground tank registration form specified in section 5-176. The only exemptions to this provision shall be where: 
(1)	The other party has separately violated this article;

Sec. 7-15. - Findings of fact. 
(a)	The flood hazard areas of the City of Port Wentworth are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 8-22-13) 
Sec. 7-16. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and

(3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
(4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)	Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

e.	Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development, and; 
(2)	Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or flood proofing level immediately after the lowest floor or flood proofing is completed. Where a structure is subject to the provisions applicable to coastal high hazards areas, after placement of the lowest horizontal structural members. Upon placement of the lowest floor, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, or upon placement of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the building inspector a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, flood-proofed elevation, or the elevation of the lowest portion of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea level. Any regulatory floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When flood proofing is utilized for non-residential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. 
Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. 
The building inspector shall review the above referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. 
(Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 8-22-13) 
Sec. 7-39. - Variance procedures. 
    The following procedures shall be followed by those seeking variances from the provisions of this article: 
(a)	The zoning board of appeals as established by the City of Port Wentworth shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)	The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)	Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section, except for the subsections (G)(1) and (4) below and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation. 
(d)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(e)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(f)	In reviewing such requests, the zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, all standards specified in this and other sections of this article, and: 
(1)	The danger that the materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)	The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)	The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)	The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)	The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
(6)	The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)	The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)	The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)	The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)	The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and other effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)	The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(g)	Conditions for variances: 
(1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)	The clerk of council shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(h)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
(9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 8-22-13) 
Sec. 7-52. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with engineered or estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)	New construction and substantial improvements -Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure including manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article 4, Section A (4), "Elevated Buildings". 
a.	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)	Non-residential construction -New construction and the substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure including manufactured housing may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in Article 3, Section C.(6). An operation and maintenance plan shall be prepared to assure the continued viability of floodproofing measures. 
(3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles -Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.	All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that: 
(i)	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than forty-eight (48) inches in height above grade. 
c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (ref. Article 4, Section(A)(6)) 
d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
(i)	Be on the site for fewer than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days. 
(ii)	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
(iii)	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "New Construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of Article 4, Section B(3)(a)(c), above. 
(4)	Floodway -Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 2, Section B, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting analysis, technical data and certification thereof. 
b.	Only if Article 4 Section B(B)(4)(a) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 4. 
(Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 8-22-13) 
Sec. 7-53. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and floodway (A-Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 2, Section B, where streams exist but no base flood data and floodway data have been provided (A-Zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)	For subdivisions and developments greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 2, Section B, are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V-Zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge; therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)	All new construction and substantial improvements shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide; 
(2)	All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with Article 4, Section F (6); 
(3)	All new construction and substantial improvements shall be securely anchored on pilings, or columns; 
(4)	All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the Georgia State adopted Standard Building Code. 
(5)	A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in Article 4, Section E (2)(3) and (4). 
(6)	All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction.

(7)	Prior to construction, plans for any structures having open wood latticework or insect screening must be submitted to the building inspector for approval; 
(8)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with open wood latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this section; 
(9)	There shall be no fill used as structural support, or to elevate areas used for septic tank drain fields. Limited non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The building inspector may approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully evaluated: 
a.	Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
b.	Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
c.	Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping.

DIVISION 2. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE PROHIBITION 

Sec. 7-72. - General provisions. 
(a)	Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
(1)	Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
(2)	These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping, and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
(3)	These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
(4)	The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values, and other uses of lands and waters. 
(5)	These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping, and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
(6)	Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations, and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
    Therefore, the City of Port Wentworth adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping, and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
(b)	Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Port Wentworth through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable. The objectives of this article are:

The City of Port Wentworth may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the City of Port Wentworth may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)	Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 or watercourses in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The City of Port Wentworth will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the City of Port Wentworth for a reconsideration and hearing. 
    A person commits a violation of this article if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the City of Port Wentworth.

DIVISION 3. - POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF 

Sec. 7-79. - General provisions. 
(a)	Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
(1)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in rivers and streams; 
(2)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and, consequently, alter water levels and fluctuations and increase pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands; 
(3)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and alter salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increase productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries; 
(4)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and closure and poses a serious threat to human health; 
(5)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and, consequently, decreasing the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers; 
(6)	The negative impacts of land development activities on these important local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public; 
(7)	The negative impacts of land development can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites; 
(8)	Communities within the coastal nonpoint source management area are required to comply with specific state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of increased stormwater runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads to be controlled and minimized. 
    Therefore, the City of Port Wentworth has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities and has established this set of stormwater management provisions to regulate post-construction stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites. 
(b)	Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources, and, consequently, the health, safety, and welfare of the general public, by establishing minimum stormwater management provisions that control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)	Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of local aquatic resources; 
(2)	Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will reduce flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources; 
(3)	Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will help preserve existing hydrologic conditions and development and redevelopment sites; 
(4)	Establish design criteria for structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria; 
(5)	Encourage the use of better site planning, better site design and low impact development practices, such as those found in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and the coastal stormwater supplement (CSS) to the maximum extent practical at development and redevelopment sites to mimic the pre-development hydrologic function of the site by encouraging natural processes that detain and filter stormwater runoff pollutants; 
(6)	Establish provisions for the long-term upkeep and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose a minimal threat to public safety; 
(7)	Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved land development projects; 
(8)	Identify and protect existing natural systems from potential adverse impacts resulting from land development activities and post construction stormwater runoff; and 
(9)	Balance development demands and natural resource protection through the implementation of low impact planning, design and development strategies. 
(c)	Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all land development activities, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (d) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment activity within City of Port Wentworth that meets one (1) or more of the following criteria: 
(1)	New development that involves the creation of (five thousand (5,000) square feet or more) of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of (one (1) acre or more); 
(2)	Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition, or replacement of (five thousand (5,000) square feet or more) of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of (one (1) acre or more); 
(3)	Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the City of Port Wentworth to be a hotspot land use; or, 
(4)	Development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate, and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules; 
(5)	For development of a project in phases, a stormwater master plan is required to conceptually indicate how the minimum requirements of this article will be met. This does not preclude the requirements of a SWMP for each phase as it is being developed. The master plan of multi-phased developments shall consolidate stormwater management facilities to as much as practical. 
(d)	Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from this article: 
(1)	Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project that is otherwise subject to this article; 
(2)	Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
(3)	Projects that are exclusively for agricultural or silvicultural activities within areas zoned for these agricultural and silvicultural use; 
(4)	Maintenance and repairs of any stormwater facility deemed necessary by the director or their designee; 
(5)	Any part of a land development project that was approved by the director or their designee prior to the adoption of this article; and, 
(6)	Redevelopment that constitutes the replacement of the original square footage of impervious cover and original acreage of other land development activity when the original development is wholly or partially lost due to natural disaster or other acts of God occurring after October 22, 2009. 
(e)	Stormwater management manual. The City of Port Wentworth will utilize the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement (CSS), the GSMM, local design and construction standards, and any relevant local addenda, for the proper implementation of this article. These references may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring, and local experience. 
(f)	Development of local stormwater design criteria. The City of Port Wentworth may furnish additional policy, criteria, and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. This information will serve to supplement and/or clarify information set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and Coastal Stormwater Supplement. 
    This information may include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. This information may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the City of Port Wentworth, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards during the design and permitting phase of a land development project.

Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)	The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
(2)	The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article. 
(3)	Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices, etc.). 
(d)	Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the City of Port Wentworth issues a variances from all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the variance is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the city. 
    When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the City of Port Wentworth agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the City of Port Wentworth Council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any development permits. 
(e)	Dedication of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a variance from the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the City of Port Wentworth for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the City of Port Wentworth prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the development permits.

Sec. 7-82. - Post-construction stormwater management criteria. 
    All development and redevelopment sites shall utilize structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to control and minimize the increased stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads caused by land development in accordance with the criteria presented below. Better site planning and design techniques and low impact development practices and nonstructural stormwater controls should be used to the maximum extent practical to reduce runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads and the site's impact on the watershed. Such techniques and practices include, but are not limited to, conservation and/or restoration of natural areas, such as forests, wetlands, and riparian buffers, minimization and/or disconnection of impervious surfaces, and small-scale distributed stormwater management practices, such as rain gardens, pervious pavement, and stormwater planters, that intercept and treat or otherwise manage stormwater runoff close to its source. 
    For structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices not included in the CSS or GSMM, or for which pollutant removal and runoff reduction rates have not been provided, the effectiveness of the structural or nonstructural stormwater management practice must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the director before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the post-construction stormwater management criteria, the director may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or due to increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the development or redevelopment site in question. 
    The following criteria shall apply to all land development activities and stormwater management design plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
(a)	Natural resources inventory. A graphic illustration of the natural resources at the development or redevelopment site, as they exist prior to the start of land development activities, shall be prepared during the site planning process. The natural resources inventory shall include, at a minimum: existing topography; natural drainage features; perennial and intermittent streams; wetlands; riparian buffers; floodplains; steep slopes; soil types; groundwater recharge areas; areas with high groundwater; conservation areas; stands of trees and/or other vegetation; and areas with significant habitat value. Protection, conservation and/or restoration of a site's natural resources through the use of better site planning techniques may, at the discretion of the director, allow for a reduction in stormwater runoff volume as a means of complying with the post-construction stormwater management criteria outlined in subsections 7-82(b) through (g). The better site planning techniques that qualify for this credit, and the procedures for calculating the runoff reduction provided by these nonstructural stormwater management practices, is provided in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement. 
(b)	Runoff reduction. Some portion of the stormwater runoff generated on a development or redevelopment site shall be captured and retained, reused, or otherwise reduced in order to preserve and/or replicate pre-development site hydrology, recharge shallow groundwater aquifers with treated stormwater runoff, promote baseflow to on-site and downstream aquatic resources, and minimize the water quality impacts of land development. A stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
(1)	It is designed to capture and retain, reuse, or otherwise reduce the prescribed runoff reduction volume from the site, as defined in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the local stormwater design manual; 
(2)	Appropriate structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that provide for the interception, evaporation, transpiration, passive infiltration, active (engineered) infiltration, extended filtration, and capture and reuse of stormwater runoff have been selected, designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the local stormwater design manual; and, 
(3)	Stormwater runoff from any development or redevelopment site that is designated by the director or in the local stormwater management criteria as a stormwater hotspot is not managed through the use of structural or nonstructural stormwater management practices that provide for passive or active (engineered) infiltration of stormwater runoff, unless adequate pre-treatment is provided, as defined by the City of Port Wentworth. 
    Green infrastructure, which includes better site planning and design techniques and low impact development practices as outlined in the GSMM and other approved design references, shall be used to the maximum extent practical during the site planning and design process to capture and retain, reuse, or otherwise reduce the prescribed runoff reduction volume on a development or redevelopment site.

Sec. 7-94. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
(a)	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 7-94(b) and (c) of this article. The application measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollutions during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
(b)	Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)	Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be requires for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(c)	Minimum protections required. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 7-94(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.	Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.	Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)	There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirements for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, proved that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.	Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.	Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)	Adoption of provisions which exceed minimum requirements. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 7-94(b) and (c) of this article. 
(e)	Presumption of violation. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 04-02, 2-12-04) 
Sec. 7-95. - Application/permit process. 
(a)	General. The property owner, developer or designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
(b)	Application requirements. 
(1)	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Port Wentworth without first obtaining a permit from the local issuing authority to perform such activity. 
(2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 7-95(c) of this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of subsections 7-94(b) and (c) of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six (6) copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
(3)	A fee, in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
(4)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) one-half (1/2) of such fees levied shall be permitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) and (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(5)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval and disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 7-94(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection 7-95(b)(5)b., have been obtained.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 09-06A, §§ 1-22, adopted May 28, 2009, repealed the former chapter 19.1, §§ 19.1-11-19.1-30, 19.1-41-19.1-43, and enacted a new chapter 19.1 as set out herein. The former chapter 19.1 pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

Sec. 19.1-1. - Purpose and findings. 
    Be it ordained by the city council of the City of Port Wentworth, Georgia, that: 
(a)	The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. See, e.g., Scenic America, Billboards and Sign Control available at http://www.scenic.org; Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP, The Public Purpose of Roswell's Sign Ordinance and the Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper (December 7, 1999) available at http://roswellgov.com; Street Graphics and the Law, 2004 Revised Edition, Daniel Mandelker, Andrew Bertucci, and William Ewald. The City of Port Wentworth's population has grown substantially since the year 2000 census, most significantly in the area of the city to the north of the intersection of State Route 21 and Crossgate Road, as evidenced by the number of building permits issued for residential construction. At the same time the City of Port Wentworth has experienced significant commercial growth, particularly in the vicinity of the I-95 interchange at State Route 21, in the form of hotels, grocery stores, restaurants, and other businesses that serve the residents of the City of Port Wentworth and the motoring public. With the increase in residential and commercial growth has come a drastic and dramatic increase in the volume of traffic in the city. In order to promote public safety, uniform regulation of signs providing directional, commercial, and noncommercial information to the motoring public is essential. Based on the above facts, cited materials and the studies referenced therein, the city finds that unregulated signs may: 
(1)	Be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians; 
(2)	Create unsafe, cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares throughout the city; 
(3)	Hamper economic growth; 
(4)	Lower property values; 
(5)	Adversely impact public investments; 
(6)	Degrade the utility of public safety signs; and 
(7)	Adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment. 
(b)	Various and diverse businesses are located within the City of Port Wentworth. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety. 
(c)	Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will: 
(1)	Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
(2)	Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare; 
(3)	Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs; 
(4)	Restrict signs and lights which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision or distracting motorists; 
(5)	Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(6)	Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings; 
(7)	Afford the business community equal and fair opportunity to advertise and promote its products and services without discrimination; 
(8)	Improve traffic and pedestrian safety; 
(9)	Maintain and enhance the visual environment, and preserve the right of citizens and visitors to enjoy the city's scenic beauty; 
(10)	Promote economic development; 
(11)	Promote the purposes stated in this section by regulating signs based on objective standards, including, but not limited to height and size, and without regard to the content of the sign message; 
(12)	Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
(d)	It is also the purpose of this article to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.

The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the administrator within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the administrator monitors at the industrial user's facility at least once a month, or if the administrator samples between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)	Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)	Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection 21-107(e) of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections 21-107(a), (c), and (d) of this article.

Discharges of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)	In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying any additional characteristics of hazardous wastes or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the administrator, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)	In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)	This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)	Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(k)	Sample collection. 
(1)	Except as indicated in paragraph (2), below, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the administrator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the industrial user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with maximum daily limits. 
(2)	Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Actual sample type requirements shall be included in the wastewater discharge permit. 
(l)	Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)	Record keeping. Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the industrial user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years.

2.	General Considerations. 
2.1	Background. The City of Port Wentworth is undergoing a revitalization effort to reverse the trends of declining population that have occurred over the past ten years. The current heart of Port Wentworth is being impacted by activities of the neighboring Georgia Ports Authority, related private sector industries, and other impacts that are unsuitable for a residential area. These activities have resulted in acquisition of private homes and increased truck traffic on South Coastal Highway, which was once the city's commercial center. The City of Port Wentworth offers little to new businesses, other than industrial uses, or residents in the proximity of the core city. For this reason, the City is looking at the areas addressed through this overlay district as the focus of future development for Port Wentworth. These areas are largely undeveloped, with the exception of small pockets of residential development. Current expansion of water and sewer infrastructure will help foster development in this area. 
2.2	Guiding Principles. In order to foster growth that will lead to the type of community desired by the citizens of Port Wentworth, the City is preparing a master plan for development. This master plan is being developed based on the principles of traditional neighborhood development (TND). Over the past several decades, traditional zoning has promoted segregated land uses, excessive minimum lot sizes, and disconnected street patterns. These characteristics have largely contributed to traffic congestion, excessive reliance on automobile ownership, social inequity, and inefficient land use. Through the use of TND principles, the master plan will result in a community of connected neighborhoods with a distinct town center, rather than a series of isolated subdivisions and strip shopping centers. Certain areas will encourage residential units above retail shops, while other areas will allow a neighborhood store in close proximity to single-family housing. Neighborhoods will be connected through a grid street pattern and a multi-purpose trail system. 
2.3	Application Procedure. Projects in the Master Plan Design Districts that require subdivision must first prepare a master plan to be reviewed by the City. All master plans require review and approval by the Port Wentworth Planning Commission and City Council. The Port Wentworth Planning Commission has primary responsibility for review of proposed projects in the Master Plan Design Districts. It is strongly recommended that the property owners or developers submit the master plan of the proposed project to the Port Wentworth Planning Commission for informal staff review prior to their submittal of the final Master Plan and application. Staff is available to meet with property owners or developers. Conceptual designs may take the form of dimensioned sketches, or may be more refined. However, the graphics should enable staff to determine if there are obvious conflicts with applicable codes and regulations. 
Standard applications for zoning changes, ground disturbance permits, sign permits, and building permits shall be utilized for proposed projects in the Master Plan Design Districts. All applications within the boundaries of these districts shall clearly state that the project is located within the (appropriate name) Master Plan Design Districts. Procedures mandated in the City of Port Wentworth Zoning Ordinance, City of Port Wentworth Subdivision Ordinance, Section 5, and the Standard Building Code (SBCC) shall be followed. 
2.3.1	Approval. Approval by the Mayor and Council of the City of Port Wentworth of the Master Plan for a parcel submitted by an applicant shall establish the basic right of use and design for that parcel. Subsequent submittals of site plans, preliminary plats, and final plats shall be reviewed on the basis of consistency with the Master Plan. Street layout and location may vary from the approved Master Plan provided that street types comply with Section 3. 
2.4	Determination of applicable code requirements. Whenever a conflict exists between the requirements of the Master Plan Overlay District and any other section of the City of Port Wentworth Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance, the requirements of the Master Plan Overlay District apply. 
2.5	Reserved.

For subdivisions, the division of property so that a lot would place a grand or specimen tree at or near the center of a lot in a location that would require the removal of said tree for construction shall be prohibited. 
4.2.3.2	Protected trees prior to development. Where a building permit or subdivision approval has not been issued, the removal, relocation, destruction or abuse in any manner of more than twenty-five (25) per cent of the protected trees (eight (8) inches or greater DBH) on any one (1) parcel of nonexempt land within any five-year period shall be prohibited. The total number of protected trees existing on any one (1) parcel shall not be reduced below a total number equal to fifteen (15) protected trees per acre. 
4.2.3.3	Protected trees during development. For parcels of land proposed for development, a minimum number of protected trees on the entire parcel equal to fifteen (15) protected trees per acre shall be saved. For parcels containing less than fifteen (15) protected trees per acre, the total number of protected trees required to be saved shall be equal to the total number or protected trees existing on the parcel. Grand trees and specimen trees to be saved may be used to calculate the total number of protected trees to be saved. 
4.2.3.4	Utilities. These requirements shall not restrict the ability of the City of Port Wentworth, public utilities and electrical suppliers from maintaining safe clearance around utility lines. 
4.2.3.5	Easements. The area of existing utility and drainage easements may be subtracted from the total site area for the purpose of calculating the number of protected trees required to be saved. 
4.2.4	Tree protection requirements. 
4.2.4.1	Protective barricades required. Protective barricades shall be placed around all protected trees, specimen trees and grand trees located in development areas, designed to protect the critical root zone (CRZ). Barricades shall be placed prior to the start of development activities, and shall remain in place until development activities are complete or construction in accordance with standards set forth in this Section commences. The area within the protective barricade shall remain free of all building materials, dirt or other construction debris, vehicles and development activities. Barricades shall be erected at a minimum distance from the base of protected trees and grand trees according to the following standards: 
1.	For Protected Trees Ten Inches or Less DBH. Protective barricades shall be placed a minimum distance of ten (10) feet from the base of each protected tree. 
2.	For Protected Trees Greater than Ten Inches DBH and Grand Trees. Protective barricades shall provide a diameter of protection around the tree equal in feet to the diameter breast height of the tree (i.e., a twenty-four-inch diameter tree would require a twenty-four-foot diameter protective barricade). 
4.2.4.2	Construction within the protective barricade. Changes in grade or construction of impervious surface or utilities within the required protective barricade shall be permitted subject to the following guidelines: 
1.	The City, prior to beginning construction, must approve the changes in grade or construction within protected zones. Plans must be submitted which illustrate in detail protective measures necessary to protect the trees.

Section 5.7 - "P" Planned District. 
    The purpose of this district shall be to provide areas within which comprehensive development plans shall be prepared and reviewed by the Port Wentworth Planning Commission and approved by Port Wentworth City Council in order to secure an orderly development pattern. Such district shall be considered an "overlay" district and the uses permitted in such district shall be those uses permitted in the zoning district which is overlaid. 
    Property may be rezoned to a "P" classification on a finding by Port Wentworth Planning Commission and approved by Port Wentworth City Council: 
a.	Such rezoning would be in the community's interest. 
b.	Unplanned and uncoordinated development could result in potential problems in such areas as traffic flow, schools, recreation, open spaces, and public facilities. 
c.	To insure an orderly growth and development, it is appropriate to acquire approval of specific development plans by the Port Wentworth City Council. 
5.7.1	Development Plan Required. 
    Such plan shall promote an environment of stable and desirable character in harmony with the established or proposed land use patterns in surrounding area. 
    Before an area shall be designated as a Planned District on the Zoning Map of the City of Port Wentworth, a general development plan shall be submitted to the Port Wentworth Planning Commission for review and recommendation to the Port Wentworth City Council. The Port Wentworth Planning Commission may recommend, disapprove, approve, or modify the plan in order to secure an orderly development pattern in accordance with the purpose of this chapter. 
    The Port Wentworth City Council may on its own motion approve a Planned District. Following such approval, the developer shall be required to submit a general development plan to the Port Wentworth Planning Commission for review and recommendation, however, no development shall take place until a specific development plan has been approved by the Port Wentworth City Council as set forth in Section 5.7.4 of this chapter. 
5.7.2	General Plan. 
    The general plan for a proposed Planned District shall include proposed uses and overall development standards and shall indicate the proposed use or reuse of all land, open spaces, location of major streets, recreation area, school sites, religious centers, and such other plan elements and reasonable design criteria as may be deemed necessary by the Port Wentworth Planning Commission. 
5.7.3	Specific Development Plan. 
    Following approval of the generalized development, no development shall take place until detailed specific development plan or subdivision plat, where required, have been submitted to Port Wentworth City Council for review and are approved. 
    If property within a "P" (Planned) district is to be developed in phases, such detailed specific development plan may be submitted in phases. 
    Specific development plans shall indicate in detail the layout of proposed streets and curb cuts; parking areas; amenities such as open spaces, landscapes, pedestrian and bicycle trails; major drainage ways; school locations; church locations; locations of public facilities; building arrangements; commercial areas; lotting arrangements and other significant details as may be reasonably acquired by Port Wentworth City Council to meet the intent of the Planned District. 
    Specific development plans as approved and certified by Port Wentworth City Council shall be certified to the Building Inspector for the issuance of applicable permits. Development requiring subdivision actions shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of the City Code. No development shall take place within a Planned District that is not shown on a specific development plan as approved and certified by Port Wentworth City Council. 
5.7.4	Standards. 
    Development standards shall be applied as provided elsewhere in this chapter for the particular district. Provided that Port Wentworth City Council may approve variances from these requirements at the request of the developer on a finding that such variances would: 
1.	Be in keeping with the overall character of the area. 
2.	Would not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
3.	Would not be detrimental to existing or proposed surrounding uses. 
4.	Would serve public purposes to a degree equal to or greater than the standards replaced. 
5.7.5	Overlay District Designations. 
    When an area is rezoned to a "P" (Planned District) the letter "P" shall be placed in front of the standard zoning district identification for the area in question; e.g. an area zoned C-2 which is rezoned to a "P" Planned District shall be indicated as a P-C-2 on the official zoning map for the City of Port Wentworth. 
5.7.6	Reimbursement of Professional Fees by Applicant for City Review of Site Plans, Subdivisions, Infrastructure, Land Disturbing Activity Permits, Etc. 
    When, in connection with the review of a proposed site plan, subdivision, infrastructure, land disturbing activity application, etc. the City requires professional services beyond the capabilities of the planning staff, the City Administrator shall notify the applicant seeking approval for such professional services. The name(s) of professionals to be retained by the City and the hourly rate charged to the City by the professional shall be provided to the applicant. If the applicant continues to seek approval and the City utilizes the services of the professional, the applicant shall reimburse the City for the costs of the professional services. The City Administrator shall require that the professional rendering services submit time records reflecting time spent and fees to the City. 
    A statement for any fees to be reimbursed to the City by the applicant shall be provided to the applicant. These fees must be paid to the City prior to issuing applicable permits.

ARTICLE XIII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES 

Section 13.1 - Findings; Public Purpose. 
    Based on experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by Port Wentworth, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attended to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the Mayor and Council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity are disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking, and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety, and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment facilities by avoiding the concentration of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses; to insure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment, and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas. Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of Port Wentworth is in the welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To the end, this ordinance is hereby adopted. 
    At the time of adoption of this Article, some of the behavior regulated herein is prohibited by Sections 15-2 and 15-4 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Port Wentworth. Nothing herein shall be construed to repeal or invalidate these provisions and it is the intent of the Mayor and Council that such conduct remain prohibited. However, in the event that the enforcement of Sections 15-2 and 15-4 are enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, these provisions shall apply to all establishments falling within its restrictions during the continuation of such judicial intervention. During such a period, each such business must apply for a license. If they would qualify for such a business, the license and fee therefor shall be held by the City Clerk until resolution of the Judicial Intervention. If such person does not meet the minimum restrictions of this ordinance, then no license shall be issued and the applicant will cease such activity until such time as the minimum qualifications can be met. If the restrictions of Sections 15-2 and 15-4 are invalidated or repealed, these restrictions shall continue to apply to all such businesses.

Such easements shall have a minimum width of twenty-two (22) feet and shall serve no more than two (2) additional lots. The following notation shall be placed on the subdivision plat and shall be in capital letters in pica size type:

Port Wentworth shall have no responsibility for the drainage of the lots nor for the furnishing or maintenance of services or utilities to the lots within the subdivision fronting on said private driveway. All utilities within the private driveway shall remain the responsibility of the owner or owners and not Port Wentworth." 
This provision will only be applicable to minor subdivision for the purposes of single-family use.

ARTICLE V. - JURISDICTION 
    The jurisdiction of this ordinance shall be all of that area within the incorporated limits of Port Wentworth, Georgia. 
ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PURPOSE 

Section 6-1. - Airspace zoning map adopted. 
    There are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the primary zone, precision instrument approach zones, nonprecision instrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zones and conical zones. Such areas and zones are shown on the Savannah International Airport Airspace Zoning Map dated June 1, 1985. Said map is made a part of this ordinance to the same extent as if the information set forth on such map was fully designed and incorporated herein, and may be amended subsequent to the adoption thereof. Said map shall be kept on file in the office of the clerk of council of the city. The various zones established are shown in Illustration Number 1 and are defined as follows. 
Section 6-2. - Primary zone. 
    An area longitudinally centered on a runway and extending two hundred (200) feet each end of that runway. The width of the primary zone is one thousand (1,000) feet for a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimum as low as three-fourths (3/4) of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways. No structure or obstruction will be permitted within the primary zone that is not part of the landing and take off facilities and is of a greater height than the nearest point on the runway center line. 
Section 6-3. - Approach zones. 
    An area longitudinal centered on the extended runway center line and extending outward from each end of the primary zone. An approach zone is designed for each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end. 
(a)	Precision instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of precision instrument runways. The inner edge of the precision instrument approach zone shall have a width of one thousand (1,000) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a distance of fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet beyond each end of the runway. 
(b)	Nonprecision instrument approach zones. Nonprecision instrument approach zones are established at each end of the nonprecision runways. The inner edge of the nonprecision instrument approach zone shall have a width of one thousand (1,000) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of four thousand (4,000) feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths statute mile. This type of approach zone extends to a horizontal distance of ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet beyond each end of the runway. 
Section 6-4. - Transitional zones. 
    Transitional zones are established adjacent to each precision and nonprecision instrument runway. They extend outward from the sides of the primary and approach zones and connect to the horizontal and conical zones. Transitional zones are further established adjacent to the precision instrument approach zone which projects through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the precision instrument approach zone perpendicular to the extended center line of the runway. 
Section 6-5. - Horizontal zone. 
(a)	A horizontal zone is the area within the perimeter of a horizontal plane that is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is ten thousand (10,000) feet for all runways at the airport. 
(b)	The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest composite value determined for either end of the runway. When a five thousand-foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two (2) adjacent ten thousand-foot arcs, the five thousand-foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal plane. The horizontal zone does not include the precision and nonprecision approach zones, and the transition zones. 
Section 6-6. - Conical zone. 
    A conical zone is established as the area that begins at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. The conical zone does not include the approach zones and transition zones. 
ARTICLE VII. - HEIGHT LIMIT 

Section 7-1. - Limitation on structures and trees. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such zone. If any structure or tree is erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in an area located in more than one (1) zone, then that structure or tree will be considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows. 
Section 7-2. - Precision instrument approach zone. 
    One foot in height for each fifty (50) feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from and at the center line elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway; thence one (1) foot in height for each forty (40) feet in horizontal distance to a point fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet from the end of the runway. 
Section 7-3. - Nonprecision instrument approach zone. 
    One foot vertically for each thirty-four (34) feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from and at the center line elevation of the nonprecision instrument runway and extending to a point ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway. 
Section 7-4. - Transitional zone. 
    This area extending outward from the sides of the primary zone and approach zones connecting them to the horizontal and conical zones. Height limits within the transitional zone are the same as the primary zone or approach zone at the boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one (1) foot vertically for every seven (7) feet horizontally, with the horizontal distance measured at right angles to the runway center line and extended center line, until the height matches the height of the horizontal zone or conical zone, or for a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the side of the part of the precision approach zone that extends beyond the conical zone. 
Section 7-5. - Horizontal zone. 
    One hundred fifty (150) feet above established airport elevation. 
Section 7-6. - Conical zone. 
    The area extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. Height limitations for structures in the conical zone are one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport height at the inner boundary with permitted height increasing one (1) foot vertically every twenty (20) feet to a height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation. 
ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING OBSTRUCTIONS 
    The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended, or to otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction or alteration of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the adoption of or to any amendments to this ordinance and is diligently prosecuted and completed within six (6) months thereof. 
ARTICLE IX. - PERMITS 

Section 9-1. - Permit required for nonconforming structures. 
    No nonconforming structures or trees may be erected, replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher or replanted in any zone created in this ordinance unless a permit is secured from the zoning administrator authorizing such replacement, change or repair, except as follows: 
(a)	No permit shall be required for any structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for the following areas: 
(1)	Within the entire limits of the horizontal, conical or transitional zones. 
(2)	Within the limits of the precision instrument approach zones. 
Section 9-2. - Application indicating purpose. 
    Each application shall indicate the purpose for which it is desired, with sufficient particularity to determine whether the resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations prescribed in this ordinance. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted. 
Section 9-3. - Permit restrictions. 
    No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this ordinance, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
Section 9-4. - Abandonment, destroyed or decayed structure. 
    Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming use, or nonconforming structure or tree, has been abandoned or is more than seventy (70) per cent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow said structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limits or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
ARTICLE X. - HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING REQUIRED 
    Any permit granted under Article IX of this ordinance may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this ordinance and reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the airport commission, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
ARTICLE XI. - REMOVAL OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES 
    The airport commission may negotiate with owners of nonconforming structures for removal, lighting or marking of existing nonconforming structures, to be installed, operated and maintained at the commission's expense. 
ARTICLE XII. - VARIANCES PROHIBITED 
    No variances, special exceptions or any other appeal within any zone created by this ordinance shall be considered or granted which would violate any restrictions imposed by this ordinance. 
ARTICLE XIII. - ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY 
    The zoning administrator is hereby designated the administrative agency charged with the duty of administering and enforcing the regulations prescribed by this ordinance. The duties of the zoning administrator shall include that of hearing and deciding all applications for permits. 
ARTICLE XIV. - PENALTIES 
    Any person convicted of violating any provision of this ordinance shall be subject to a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) or imprisonment not to exceed thirty (30) days, or both, and shall be required to remove the subject obstruction.
