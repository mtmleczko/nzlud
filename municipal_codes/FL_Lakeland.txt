PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Lakeland, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1960 Code, as supplemented through December 18, 1989, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1960 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary Rose DiMarco, Supervising Editor, and Ron McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Joseph P. Mawhinney, City Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Editor's note- Printed herein is the Charter of the City of Lakeland, as adopted by Ord. No. 1976, 8-16-76 and subsequently approved by a referendum of the electorate on November 2, 1976. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation.

Sec. 1. - Present municipality abolished.

Sec. 2. - Title, rights reserved; contracts binding; officers continue to serve; ordinances continue in effect.

Sec. 3. - Municipal government created with perpetual succession. 
    The said municipality, and all the inhabitants comprehended within the territorial limits hereinbefore described, shall be, and are hereby created and constituted a body corporate and politic under and by the name of the City of Lakeland, and by that name may have perpetual succession, may hold real estate, personal and mixed property, and dispose of the same for the benefit of the city; and may purchase, lease, receive, acquire by eminent domain and hold property, real and personal, within or beyond the limits of the city to be used for the burial or cremation of the dead, the erection and maintenance of electrical generating facilities, power lines, waterworks, water lines, pumps and water systems, airports, neutralizing or otherwise destroying of sewage, garbage and refuse, to extend sewer and drainage pipes and water mains, and for any public municipal purpose that the city commission may deem proper; and may sell, lease or dispose of said property for the benefit of the city to the same intent that natural persons might do.

Sec. 79. - Revocable permits for laying spur tracks not considered grants. 
    Revocable permits for laying spur tracks across or along streets, alleys or public grounds, to connect a steam or electric railroad with any property in need of switching facilities, shall not be regarded as a grant within the meaning herein, but may be permitted in accordance with such terms and conditions as the city commission may by ordinance prescribe.

(f)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, and no amendment shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this plan. 
(g)  No trustee or the board shall be liable for any claim arising out of the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own gross negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(h)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(i)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalization, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(j)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein.

(l)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits herein provided for. 
(m)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(n)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all time maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(o)  The city is hereby authorized to provide such funds, by tax levy or otherwise and to appropriate and pay such funds monthly to the board for deposit in the fund. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(p)  In the event the fund, together with contributions thereto at the current rate, shall be determined to be insufficient to make full payments as provided herein, immediate action shall be taken to provide for the deficit; provided, that such determination shall be in accordance with the standards, methods, factors and assumptions recommended by a qualified actuary and approved by the board and the city commission. 
(q)  Each plan member or other person who shall claim the right to any payment under the plan shall be entitled to look only to the fund for payment. No liability for the payment of annuities under the plan shall be imposed upon the board or the city.

(3)  Is the benefit factor determined from Benefit Factor Table II in section 23.4.2, based on the age of the employee in years and months on the day retirement benefits commence. If the employee's age is sixty-two (62) or greater, the benefit factor shall be one (1). 
(f)  For Plan members who enter the plan after September 30, 2003 and who have elected to transition to Plan C pursuant to section 23.1, the amount of monthly pension benefit shall be equal to (1) multiplied (2) multiplied by (3) as follows: 
(1)  Is: 
(a)  Two (2) percent multiplied by one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the number of completed months of credited service for which contributions are made as of February 25, 2011 up to a total of one hundred twenty (120) months, plus three (3) percent multiplied by one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the number of completed months of credited service for which contributions are made as of February 25, 2011 in excess of one hundred twenty (120) months up to a total of three hundred sixty (360) months, plus one (1) percent multiplied by one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the number of completed months of credited service for which contributions are made as of February 25, 2011 in excess of three hundred sixty (360) months. 
plus: 
(b)  Two and forty-one hundredths (2.41) percent multiplied by one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the number of completed months of credited service after February 25, 2011 for which contributions are made.

(3)  Is the benefit factor determined from Benefit Factor Table II in section 23.4.2, based on the age of the employee in years and months on the day retirement benefits commence. If the employee's age is sixty-two (62) or greater, the benefit factor shall be one (1). 
(g)  The consecutive period so selected by the employee must be a period during which the employee has continuously contributed to the plan. Any employee with interrupted service, who has repaid into the fund the amount previously refunded to him in accordance with section 26-2 of this article, shall be treated as having continuously contributed to the Plan. 
For purposes of computing pension benefits, all accrued sick leave at date of retirement shall be credited as additional time of continuous employment at an equivalency ratio of one month service for every twenty-one (21) days of accrued sick leave. 
(h)  The normal form of retirement benefits shall be an income to the member commencing at retirement and continuing during the life of the member. In the event of death of the retired member, any excess of the sum of the member's contributions over the total of such income received by the member shall be paid to the member's designated beneficiary as a refund of contributions. 
(i)  Benefits under this plan shall not exceed the limits set under Section 415(b) of the Code.

    23.4.3. Terminated vested. An inactive member who reaches his early retirement eligibility date may elect to begin benefits. 
(a)  Terminated vested members benefits shall be calculated as in section 23.4.1. above, provided that the benefit calculation be based upon benefits which existed at the time of termination of employment. When a member has elected to leave his contributions in the fund upon separation from service and is entitled to a vested deferred pension pursuant to section 26.1(b), his monthly pension income shall be adjusted to reflect any increase in benefits pursuant to section 25 of this section which becomes effective after his date of separation from service. 
(b)  A terminated vested member may request an optional payment form as provided, in section 23.4.4, in lieu of the normal form. 
(c)  Except as indicated in (d), should a terminated vested member die prior to the date benefits begin, all benefit obligations of the plan to the member shall cease. 
    23.4.4. Optional benefit payment forms. The following actuarial equivalent forms of benefits payment, when requested in writing, may be granted by the board: 
(a)  Option 1: Alternate benefit form. In lieu of retirement benefits payable in a normal form, a member may elect benefits in an alternative form having the actuarial equivalent value. Such alternate pension benefits shall be in lieu of all of the benefits under the plan and shall be either: 
(1)  A reduced income payable during the lifetime of the member, together with a continuation of the same reduced income (100 percent) or an income in a lesser amount (fifty (50) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent or seventy-five (75) percent of such reduced income) to the member's spouse or joint pensioner. 
(2)  A reduced income payable during the lifetime of the member, together with the continuation upon the death of the member of the same reduced income (100 percent) or an income in a lesser amount (fifty (50) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent or seventy-five (75) percent of such reduced income) to the member's spouse or, joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries), provided that the reduced income under this paragraph shall be lower than that provided under paragraph (1) with the reduction calculated on an actuarial equivalent basis which provides for the cessation of reduction in benefits to the member at the date of death of the member's spouse or joint pensioner, if the spouse or joint pensioner predeceases such member or, if applicable, at the date of emancipation, removal of, disability or death of his eligible dependent(s) when such emancipation, removal of, disability or death occurs prior to member's death. In the event the spouse or joint pensioner predeceases the member, or the emancipation, removal of, disability or death of the eligible dependent(s) precedes the member's death, the election shall be canceled and the normal form and amount of benefits described in subsection (a) shall thereafter be paid. 
(3)  The member electing any option of this section will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the plan in the event of death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time but any such change shall be deemed a new election and will be subject to approval by the board of trustees. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and his or her retirement income benefits have commenced, he or she may thereafter change the designated joint pensioner or beneficiary but only if the board of trustees consents to such change and if the joint pensioner last previously designated by the member is alive when he or she files with the board of trustees a request for such change. The consent of a member's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The board of trustees may request such evidence of the good health of the joint pensioner that is being removed as it may require and the amount of the retirement income payable to the member upon the designation of a new joint pensioner shall be actuarially redetermined taking into account the ages and sex of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner, and the member. Each such designation will be made in writing and on completion will be filed with the board of trustees. A retired member may change the designation of joint pensioner or beneficiary only twice. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the member, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the member subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid as provided in paragraph (4). 
(4)  Beneficiary (Beneficiaries). Each member may, on a form filed with the board of trustees, designate a choice of one or more persons, named sequentially or jointly, as his or her beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of the member's death, and each designation may be revoked by such member by signing and filing with the board of trustees a new designation or beneficiary form. If no beneficiary is named or if no beneficiary designated by the member survives him or her, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the plan with respect to such deceased member shall be paid by the board of trustees to the estate of such deceased member, provided that in any of such cases the board of trustees, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments be paid in a lump sum. Any payment made to any person pursuant to this subsection shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the plan with regard to such deceased member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(b)  Option 2: Refund of contributions. In lieu of option 1, a member may elect to receive a refund of all sums said member contributed to the fund in full satisfaction of all claims he may have against this Plan. 
(c)  Option 3: Lump Sum Payment. 
(1)  A member who attains normal retirement status or attains thirty (30) years of credited service may elect to terminate membership in the Plan and apply for a lump sum payment. 
(2)  In lieu of any other benefits under the Plan, the Board may grant a request for an actuarial equivalent, one time, lump sum payment based upon the present value of the retirement benefit. The present value discount rate used to determine the lump sum amount available to the member shall be the actuarial assumed rate of return plus one (1) percent. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement Plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(d)  Option 4: Termination from Plan with vested benefit. A member who attains normal retirement status, or attains thirty (30) years of credited service, or who is eligible to retire and has accrued a vested benefit equal to thirty (30) percent or more of average final compensation calculated after any percentage reductions associated with early retirement, may elect to terminate membership in the Plan, defer receipt of benefits until a later date and commence participation in the City of Lakeland Defined Contribution Plan or roll-over the benefit provided in (c) above to the Defined Contribution Plan and continue participation in the Defined Contribution Plan and relinquish any further rights in the Plan. Upon termination of employment from the City, the member may elect to begin receiving benefits under the Plan. 
(1)  Retirement benefits under this Plan with respect to a member who elects this option shall be calculated as in section 23.4.1. above, provided that the benefit calculation be based upon benefits which existed at the time of the member's termination of active participation in the Plan. The benefit shall be adjusted to reflect any increase in benefits pursuant to section 25 of this section which becomes effective after date of termination from the Plan. 
(2)  A member under this option may request an alternate payment form as provided in section 23.4.4(a) in lieu of the normal form. 
(3)  Should a member exercising this option die prior to the date benefits payments from this Plan begin, all benefit obligations of the Plan to the member shall cease unless the member requested an alternate payment form as provided in section 23.4.4(a) at the time of exercising this option or one year prior to final termination of employment from the City. 
(e)  Option 5: Guaranteed annual benefit increase. An actuarially reduced income payable during the lifetime of the member with a guaranteed annual increase in the member's, or to the extent an optional form of benefits has been elected pursuant to 23.4.4(a) to the member's spouse or, joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries), retirement benefit of one (1), two (2) or three (3) percent. The amount of the guaranteed annual increase is be effective on the anniversary of the first benefit check payable to the member, or to the member's DROP account in conjunction with an election pursuant to section 23.4.5, in any calendar year. 
(f)  Actuarial Assumptions. The Actuarial Assumptions used in determining members' benefits are stated in the annual actuarial report and shall be maintained by the secretary of the Board. 
    23.4.5 Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP). A Member who attains normal retirement age or attains thirty (30) years of credited service may elect to retire and enter the DROP. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, effective December 31, 2011 for non-bargaining unit members who are employed and not participating in the DROP on such date, and commencing the end of the first pay period following ratification of a collective bargaining agreement for bargaining unit members who are employed and not participating in the DROP on such date, members may elect to retire and enter the DROP on or after the date on which the member is: (a) eligible to receive benefits pursuant to normal or early retirement as defined in the respective version of the plan (A, B or C) in which the member is enrolled as of the date of this election; or (b) the sum of the member's years of credited service and age equals at least seventy-five (75). For purposes of computing eligibility for this option, any accrued sick leave at date of retirement shall not be considered as additional time of credited service: 
(a)  The decision to enter the DROP is irrevocable once the DROP period commences. Upon entry into the DROP, a member shall be considered a retired member of the Plan. The member's benefits shall be calculated as if the member had actually separated from service and no further credited service, salary increases, or Plan changes shall apply to a member in the DROP plan for purposes of determining the member's benefit under the Plan. In all other respects, however, the member shall remain an active employee of the City and otherwise eligible for all other contractual and job benefits. 
(b)  The monthly pension benefit payable during the DROP period shall be credited in semi-monthly installments to a DROP account for the Member and shall remain an asset of the fund in accordance with procedures established by the Board of Trustees. Such retirement benefit, including any retiree benefit increases pursuant to an optional form of benefits elected pursuant to section 23.4.4(e) shall accrue semi-monthly. Interest on the DROP account balances of members who enter the DROP prior to December 31, 2011 and for bargaining unit members who enter the DROP prior to ratification of a collective bargaining agreement shall accrue at a nominal annualized rate of 6.5 percent compounded semi-monthly, on the prior installment's accumulated ending balance, up to the 120th payment or the last payment made prior to final separation from service or death, whichever occurs first. The deposited funds will be unavailable for distribution to the Member until participation in the DROP and service with the City terminates. Thereafter, the benefit shall be paid to the Member in accordance with the provisions of this section and procedures payments adopted by the Board of Trustees, which may require up to thirty (30) days advance notice from the Member of the payment method and option elected by the Member. Effective upon adoption, each current and future Member of the DROP may elect on an annual basis to have their DROP account credited and compounded semi-monthly at a variable interest rate, not to exceed three percent (3%) per annum. The Board of Trustees shall review and set the variable interest rate once each year. Within 60 days of announcing the variable interest rate, each Member of the DROP may elect to transfer all, some, or none of their existing DROP account balance and future DROP account accruals to the City of Lakeland Defined Contribution Plan, subject to Board approval, via a plan to plan transfer; provided, that all such transfers made to the City of Lakeland Defined Contribution Plan are irrevocable and shall not be transferred back to the member's DROP account at any point thereafter. A failure to make such an initial election means that the Member's DROP balance will remain in the Fund and earn said variable interest rate. Each year thereafter, within 60 days of the Board of Trustees setting the variable interest rate, each Member in the DROP shall elect whether any amounts remaining in the Fund and whether future DROP account accruals will either: i) be credited at a variable interest rate, compounded semi-monthly on the prior installment's accumulated ending balance until such time as the earlier of either: the 120th payment; or the last payment made prior to final separation from service; or death; or be irrevocably transferred to the City of Lakeland Defined Contribution Plan, as above. Any member of the DROP who fails to make such a written annual election within the prescribed time shall continue with the option, as described herein in which the Member was then currently participating. 
(c)  Effective with the date of DROP participation, the member's initial normal monthly benefit, optional form of payment, and average final compensation, and the effective date of retirement shall be fixed. The Member may designate a beneficiary to receive the balance in the Member's DROP account if the DROP member dies prior to the DROP payout to the Member. If such beneficiary is not designated or is not living at the time of the Member's death, then the beneficiary established under the Plan shall receive the balance in the Member's DROP account; or if no such beneficiary is designated or living at the time of death, then the joint annuitant, if any, shall receive the balance in the Member's DROP account. The Member may also name a beneficiary to receive the accumulated DROP benefits payable if the joint annuitant predeceases the Member. In the event that no beneficiary has been named by the Member, the DROP account balance shall be paid to the Member's estate. 
(d)  The effective date of DROP participation and the effective date of retirement of a DROP member shall be the first day of any City payroll period selected by the Member to begin participation in the DROP, provided such date is properly established, with the written confirmation of the city, and the approval of the Retirement Services Department, on forms required by the Retirement Services Department. 
(e)  Upon entry into the DROP, a member shall no longer be eligible for pre-retirement death benefits. 
(f)  In the event that a member in the DROP shall die, the member shall be treated the same as any other retired member who dies and any survivorship option which the member may have elected shall be paid to the Member's joint annuitant in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. 
(g)  By entering into the DROP plan, a member agrees to terminate active service with the City not later than sixty (60) months following the date of entry into the DROP. Nothing shall prohibit a member who has entered the DROP or the City from terminating service prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) months. 
(h)  A member's DROP Account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the Member is employed by the City as a Member of the Plan. If a member remains employed by the City after participating in the DROP for five (5) years, then beginning with Member's 61st month of DROP participation the member's DROP Account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will semi-monthly benefits be credited to the DROP Account. All such earnings, interest and benefits shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the City. A member employed by the City after five (5) years of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits nor will the Member accrue additional Credited Service. 
(i)  The accrued benefits of any DROP member, and any contributions, earnings or interest accumulated under such program, shall not be subject to assignment, execution, attachment, or to any legal process whatsoever. Upon the death of a DROP member, the accrued benefits shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c), above. 
(j)  Eligibility to participate in the DROP terminates upon death of the member. If the member dies on or after the effective date of enrollment in the DROP, but prior to the first monthly benefit being credited to the DROP, Plan benefits shall be paid in accordance with provisions contained in the Plan as though the Member retired on the effective date of the DROP enrollment and died thereafter. 
(k)  Upon satisfying the definition of termination of employment, DROP members shall be subject to the same reemployment limitations as other retirees. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP members from the scope of s. 8(d), Art. II of the State Constitution, s. 112.3173, and paragraph (5)(f). 
(l)  DROP members who commit a specified felony offense while employed will be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits, pursuant to those provisions of the law. 
(m)  Upon separation from service a member shall be eligible for distribution of the DROP account. The DROP account may be distributed in a lump sum, may be rolled over to another qualified retirement system, a combination of both, or any other form approved by the Board. In no instance shall the method of distribution result in the payment of any amount which exceeds the balance in the DROP account. 
(n)  At the conclusion of the member's DROP, the Retirement Services Department shall distribute the member's total accumulated DROP benefits, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Retirement Services Department shall receive verification by the member's department head that such member has terminated employment. 
(2)  The discharged DROP member or, if deceased, such member's named beneficiary or joint annuitant, shall elect on forms provided by the Retirement Services Department to receive payment of the DROP benefits in accordance with one of the options listed below. For a member or beneficiary who fails to elect a method of payment within 60 days of termination of employment, the Retirement Services Department will authorize a lump sum payment as provided below: 
(I)  Lump sum - All accrued DROP benefits, plus interest, less withholding taxes remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, shall be paid to the DROP member or surviving beneficiary. 
(II)  Direct rollover - All accrued DROP benefits, plus interest, shall be paid from the DROP directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as defined in s. 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased member, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as described in s. 402(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(III)  Partial lump sum - A portion of the accrued DROP benefits shall be paid to the DROP member or surviving spouse, less withholding taxes remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, and the remaining DROP benefits shall be transferred directly to the custodian of an eligible retirement plan as defined in s. 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse of a deceased member, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity as described in s. 402(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. The proportions shall be specified by the DROP member or surviving beneficiary. 
(3)  The form of payment selected by the DROP member or surviving beneficiary complies with the minimum distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(o)  The Board of Trustees shall make such rules as are necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this subsection. Neither the Retirement Services Department nor the Board of Trustees shall advise members of the federal tax consequences of an election related to the DROP but may advise members to seek independent advice. 
    23.4.8 Purchase of Prior Service. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, a Member may purchase up to five (5) years of credited service at any time prior to separation from city employment for a like period of previous employment in the active service of the U.S. armed forces; provided the Member shall pay into the plan the full actuarial cost of such service as determined by the plan actuary. Such service credit shall be counted as continuous service for purposes of vesting, benefit eligibility and benefit calculations. No additional service credit will be allowed if the Member has received, is receiving or will receive any other retirement benefit based on that same prior armed forces service; provided, a Member may make a direct transfer of eligible rollover distributions of all or any portion of the balance in another eligible retirement plan that is attributable to service with the armed forces to purchase additional service under this paragraph. 
    Payment for the benefits provided in this section may be made in one or more of the following manners: 
a)  Cash lump sum payment. 
b)  Direct transfer or rollover of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified or eligible plan, in accordance with section 23.4.6, Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions, herein.

Sec. 24. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Annual Pension that is accrued by or paid to a Member shall not exceed the Dollar Limitation set forth below. If the benefit the Member would otherwise accrue in a Limitation Year would produce an Annual Pension in excess of the Dollar Limitation, the benefit shall be limited to a benefit that does not exceed the Dollar Limitation. 
(1)  Definitions Used in this Section. 
(A)  "Annual Pension" means the benefits received by a Member under this Plan expressed in the form of a straight life annuity. In determining whether benefits payable exceed the Dollar Limitation set forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity shall be adjusted to the larger of: 
(i)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the Member; or 
(ii)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the Member, computed using a 5 percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table described in § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) for that annuity starting date. 
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not subject to § 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this Section, and the amount payable under the form of benefit in any Limitation Year shall not exceed the limits of this Section 24 applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form. 
(B)  "Dollar Limitation" means $160,000.00 (subject to the annual adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said amount shall be adjusted based on the age of the Member when benefits begin, as follows: 
(i)  Except with respect to a Member who is a "Qualified Participant" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code) beginning before age 62 the Age-Adjusted Dollar Limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
(I)  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age 62, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 62 are equal to the Dollar Limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the Member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
(II)  The Dollar Limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d)) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan commencing at age 62, with both annual amounts determined without applying the rules of section 415. 
(ii)  For benefits beginning after the age of 65, the age-adjusted Dollar Limitation is equal to the lesser of: 
(I)  The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as a straight life annuity commencing at age 65, where annual payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age 65 are equal to the dollar limitation of section 415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the Member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and 
(II)  The section 415(b)(1)(A) Dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) and § 1.415(d)-1 for the limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan to the adjusted age 65 straight life annuity. The adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity means the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity payable to the Member, computed disregarding the Member's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset accruals. For this purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity is determined without applying the rules of section 415. The adjusted age 65 straight life annuity means the annual amount of the straight life annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical Member who is 65 years old and has the same accrued benefit (with no actuarial increases for commencement after age 65) as the Member receiving the distribution (determined disregarding the Member's accruals after age 65 and without applying the rules of section 415). 
(iii)  There shall be no age adjustment of the Dollar Limitation with respect to benefits beginning between the ages of 62 and 65. 
(2)  The limitations set forth in this Section 24 shall not apply if the Annual Pension does not exceed $10,000.00, provided the Member has never participated in a Defined Contribution Plan maintained by the City. 
(3)  Cost-of-living adjustments in the Dollar Limitation for benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section Subsection 415(d) of the Code. 
(4)  In the case of a Member who has fewer than 10 years of participation in the Plan, the Dollar Limitation set forth in Paragraph (1)(B) of this Section (b) shall be multiplied by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the Plan; and (ii) the denominator of which is 10. 
(5)  Any portion of a Member's benefit that is attributable to mandatory employee contributions (unless picked-up by the City) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the Code. 
(6)  Should any Member participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained by the City, in any case in which the Member's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the Dollar Limitation applicable at that age, the accrual of the Member's benefit under this Plan shall be reduced so that the Member's combined benefits will equal the Dollar Limitation. 
(7)  For a Member who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the Annual Benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this Section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d), and with regard to §§ 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(8)  The determination of the Annual Pension under Paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 24 shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the Code) Social Security supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of distributable benefits pursuant § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(9)  The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of the Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the City shall be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this Section 24 of the Plan and the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder, such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of Section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application of this Section 24 shall be used to decrease future employer contributions.

Sec. 24.1. - Certain transfers; vested rights on transfer. 
    For employees who served in more than one (1) of the City's employee classifications and participated in more than one (1) City pension plan: 
    A member shall be credited with service for purposes of participation, vesting and breaks in service (but not for benefit purposes) based upon service in non-covered employment for the City, provided that the person worked for the City in covered employment immediately before or immediately after the non-covered employment, and further provided that no resignation, discharge or retirement occurred between the covered employment and the non-covered employment. Years of service, solely for purposes of vesting and benefit eligibility, shall be computed from the date upon which the employee was initially hired by the city, without consideration of the transfer. The pension benefit from this plan shall be payable to those employees who are not covered by this plan at the time of retirement upon the employee reaching this pension plan's Early or Normal Retirement Age as defined herein. The amount shall be calculated by multiplying the vesting credits earned while an employee by the benefit level of this pension plan and the employee's average final compensation which are in effect at the time of the employee's retirement. The benefit payable from this plan shall be only for the employee's service under this plan and the benefit for the employee's service in classifications covered by other city pension plans shall be paid by the other pension plans, which cover those other classifications. Notwithstanding, the total of all such benefit payments shall be subject to limitations established by F.S. § 112.65. 
(Ord. No. 5156, § 1, 4-19-10) 
Sec. 25. - Increased benefits to retired members. 
    The award of any benefit will comply with F.S. ch. 112. Accordingly, the present value of the benefit award shall not exceed the net actuarial experience accumulated from all sources of gains and losses to the plan. 
    Members who retire from the plan on or after December 31, 2011 shall be entitled to a guaranteed annual increase in benefits accordance with any irrevocable election made pursuant to section 23.4.4(e).

Sec. 26.1. - Separation from service. 
(a)  Refund to member. In the event a member with less than ten (10) years of contribution resigns, is discharged, or becomes disabled, or separates from the service of the city, without leave of absence from the civil service board of said city, he shall, pursuant to written request, receive a refund of all sums said member has contributed to this fund, subject to section 23.4.6. Such payment thereof to said member shall be in full satisfaction of all claims he may have against this plan. A Member who resigns, is discharged, or becomes disabled, or separates from the service of the city, without leave of absence from the civil service board of said city, and elects to leave contributions in the fund, shall receive prior service credit upon reemployment. Such prior service credit shall be counted towards their original plan benefits as stated herein prior to separation. All service credit earned upon reemployment shall be accrued as per the terms of the plan and pensionable as of their new hire date. 
(b)  Members who are discharged from service of the city and elect to leave contributions in the fund and are then reemployed by the City within twelve (12) calendar months, shall be eligible for the pension benefits provided for in section 23.4 herein based on that Member's original hire date. 
(c)  Death of member. 
(1)  In the event of the death of an active employee of the city who at the time of death has ten (10) years of continuous contributions to the plan, the surviving spouse or, where there is no spouse, the eligible dependent(s) of such employee shall receive a monthly retirement benefit which would be the actuarial equivalent to one-half (1/2) of the retirement benefit the employee would have received upon retirement on the date of death. The benefit factor shall be one (1) for purpose of computing the retirement benefit. However, in the event of the death of an active employee who has attained age fifty (50), and has ten (10) or more continuous years of contribution to this plan, the surviving spouse or, where there is no spouse, the eligible dependent(s) of such employee shall receive a monthly retirement benefit which would be the actuarial equivalent to seventy-five (75) percent of the retirement benefit the employee would have received upon retirement on the date of death unless the member had filed a certificate with the civil service department prior to death electing an alternative reduced benefit at retirement of fifty (50) percent or sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent in which case the lesser percentage rate would be utilized in computing the benefit. The benefit factor shall be one (1) for purpose of computing the retirement benefit. In the event there is no spouse or eligible dependent(s) of the member, all sums contributed by such member to the plan shall be refunded to his designated beneficiary, if any, or, if none, to the deceased's estate. A surviving spouse or eligible dependent(s) may elect to waive the benefit provided in the preceding paragraphs and in lieu thereof, receive a refund of all sums contributed by such employee. 
(2)  Should any member, who has less than ten (10) continuous years of contributions to the plan, die while employed by the city, all sums contributed by such member shall be refunded to his designated beneficiary, if any; or if none, to his surviving spouse, if any; or if none, to the deceased's estate. 
(d)  Contributions by member while on leave. Any member hereunder, who is entitled to a leave and is granted a leave under the rules and policies of the civil service board of the city, may leave his contributions in the fund, and upon return from leave he shall be entitled to benefits as if he had remained actively employed, provided such member and the city contributed to the fund for the period on leave at the same rate as during the last full month of contribution prior to the commencement of such leave.

The interest shall be calculated from the date of return of contribution to the final date of repayment, and shall be compounded. The interest rate used in the computation shall be computed in a such a manner so as to incur no cost to the fund. Should an employee, who has recaptured all or part of any such past credited service, again terminate employment prior to retirement, the return of contribution shall be limited to the return of principal.

If the Member dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Member's death, distribution of the Member's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Member's death. 
(C)  Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to Surviving Spouse Begin. In any case in which: (i) the Member dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins; (ii) the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary; and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, Subparagraphs (2)(A) and 2(B) above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the Member. 
(3)  Requirements For Annuity Distributions That Commence During Member's Lifetime. 
(A)  Joint Life Annuities Where the Beneficiary Is Not the Member's Spouse. If the Member's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Member and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the Member's Required Beginning Date to the designated beneficiary after the Member's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the Member using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Member and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
(B)  Period Certain Annuities. Unless the Member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the Member's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Member under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the Member reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the Member is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the Member as of the Member's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the Member's spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the Member's applicable distribution period, as determined under this Subparagraph (3)(B), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Member and the Member's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the Member's and spouse's attained ages as of the Member's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(4)  Form of Distribution. Unless the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with Subparagraphs (4)(A), (4)(B) and (4)(C) below. If the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the Member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(A)  General Annuity Requirements. If the Member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
(ii)  The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period described in Paragraphs (2) or (3) above, whichever is applicable, of this Subsection (c); 
(iii)  Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
(iv)  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(I)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(II)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the Member's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the Member's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code; 
(III)  To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the Member's death; or 
(IV)  To pay increased benefits that result from a Plan amendment. 
(B)  Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the Member's Required Beginning Date (or, if the Member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Subparagraphs (2)(A)(i) or (2)(A)(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the Member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the Member's Required Beginning Date. 
(C)  Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(5)  For purposes of this Subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the Member's Required Beginning Date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Member (or to the Member's Surviving Spouse) before the Member's Required Beginning Date (or, if to the Member's Surviving Spouse, before the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with Subparagraph (2)(A) above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(6)  Definitions. 
(A)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
(B)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Member's Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the Member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to Paragraph (2) of this Subsection (c). 
(C)  Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations. 
(d)  Eligible rollover distributions. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board of trustees, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distribute in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions:

However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. An eligible retirement plan shall also mean, with respect to distributions made after December 31, 2001, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relation order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code. 
C.  Distributee: A distributee includes an Member or former Member. 
D.  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

Sec. 2-97. - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  The code inspector shall initiate proceedings to enforce the various codes of the city. No member of the board individually, or the board collectively, may initiate enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a violation of any code is found, the code inspector shall so notify the violator and a reasonable time to correct the violation shall be permitted. If the violation continues beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall notify the enforcement board and request a hearing pursuant to the procedure in section 2-98. Written notice of such hearing shall be provided to the violator in accordance with section 2-103. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the enforcement board or hearing officer even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the enforcement board and request a hearing. The code enforcement board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to section 2-103. The case may be presented to the enforcement board even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code enforcement board retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the code enforcement board. 
(d)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the enforcement board and request a hearing. 
(e)  If the owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before the enforcement board, hearing officer, or court transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement division of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in subsections (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held.

A hearing may also be called by written notice signed by at least three members of the code enforcement board. At any hearing the board may set a future hearing date. The board shall hold hearings no less frequently than once every two months if cases are pending but may meet more or less often as needed. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings by the board and all hearings shall be open to the public. 
(b)  Conduct of initial hearing. 
(1)  After the initial request for hearing by the code enforcement officer, a hearing may be scheduled before either a code enforcement board hearing officer or the code enforcement board. The same provisions specified in this section for the conduct of the initial hearing before a hearing officer shall also apply if the hearing is scheduled before the enforcement board. Hearing officers shall be residents of the city and appointed by the city commission for various terms not to exceed three years each. The commission may appoint multiple hearing officers or in the case of a law firm a single firm whose duties may be rotated as individual schedules permit. A hearing officer may be reappointed to one successive term. Appointments shall be made on the basis of experience or interest in fields of zoning, building, or land use. Whenever possible, the hearing officer shall be chosen from one of the following categories: 
a.  An architect; 
b.  A businessman; 
c.  An engineer; 
d.  A general contractor or subcontractor; 
e.  A realtor; 
f.  An attorney; or 
g.  An urban planner. 
(2)  Unless scheduled before the code enforcement board, code enforcement hearing officers shall conduct the initial hearing. A member of the city attorney's staff may attend the hearing and assist the hearing officer in the conduct of the hearing. A code enforcement officer shall represent the City of Lakeland by presenting cases before the hearing officer. At the initial hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the code enforcement officer to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a violation does exist. Provided that proper notice of the initial hearing has been served upon the alleged violator as provided herein, such hearing may proceed in the absence of the alleged violator. 
(3)  All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The hearing officer shall take testimony from the code enforcement officer and also from the alleged violator, if the alleged violator desires to testify, and from such other witnesses as may be called by the respective sides or the hearing officer. 
(4)  Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and govern said proceedings. Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded, but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a trial in the courts of the State of Florida. 
(5)  The hearing officer or representative of the city attorney's office may inquire of any witness. The alleged violator, or his attorney, shall be permitted to inquire of any witness and shall be permitted to present brief opening and closing statements. 
(6)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue findings of fact based on evidence in the record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording proper relief consistent with the powers granted by laws. The hearing officer shall state the essence of the order orally at the meeting and it shall be reduced to writing and said order mailed by regular United States mail to the alleged violator within a reasonable period after the hearing. 
(7)  The order shall set a date certain by which the violator shall comply with the order. The hearing officer may assess an administrative fine to be paid by the violator for each and every day the violation continues beyond said date certain. Such fine shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation, $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, or such other fine as may be authorized by law. In addition, in all cases in which the city prevails in proving the existence of a violation, the hearing officer may impose the city's costs of prosecuting the violation, even if no fine is imposed. The findings of fact and conclusions of law rendered by the hearing officer in his order shall be final. 
(c)  Proceedings subsequent to hearing officer. 
(1)  In the event any violator wishes to contest the hearing officer's order, he must file an objection in writing within ten days of rendition of the hearing officer's order. The code enforcement board shall schedule and conduct a hearing pursuant to those procedures set forth in this section. Unless modified by the code enforcement board, any objection to the hearing officer's order shall not result in a delay to the proposed compliance date. 
(2)  In the event of a hearing following an appeal from a hearing officer order, or in the instance where the code enforcement board hears a case initially, at the conclusion of the hearing, the code enforcement board shall issue findings of fact, based upon evidence in the record, and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order consistent with the powers granted by law. The order shall be essentially stated orally at the meeting and shall be reduced to writing and mailed by regular United States mail to the alleged violator's last known address within a reasonable period following the hearing. The findings shall be by motion approved by a majority of those present and voting. 
(3)  The code enforcement board shall set a date certain by which the violator shall comply with the lawful order of the board. The board may assess an administrative fine to be paid by the violator for each and every day the violation continues beyond said date certain. Such fine shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation, or $500.00 per day in case of a repeat violation beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred. In addition, in all cases in which the city prevails in proving the existence of a violation, the board may impose the city's costs of prosecuting the violation, even if no fine is imposed. 
(4)  A certified copy of the board's order, or the hearing officer's order, if applicable, may be recorded in the public records of Polk County and shall constitute notice to all subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. The findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the board shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue an order acknowledging compliance.

Sec. 2-100. - Fines; liens. 
(a)  The enforcement board or the hearing officer, upon notification by the code inspector that an order of the enforcement board or hearing officer has not been complied with by the set time or, upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the enforcement board or the hearing officer for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in subsection 2-97(d), the enforcement board or hearing officer shall notify the local governing body, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the local governing body to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the local governing body for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this section, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, or, if a code enforcement board or hearing officer finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. In addition, the board or hearing officer may include all costs of repairs made pursuant to this section. In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the enforcement board or hearing officer shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(c)  The enforcement board may reduce a code enforcement fine imposed pursuant to this section. In addition, the board is authorized to reduce and otherwise grant relief from special assessment liens imposed by the city commission as a result of the demolition and lot cleaning and clearing activities of the city. Except in extreme circumstances, no waiver or reduction shall be considered of that portion of code enforcement and/or special assessment liens that reflect hard costs already paid by the city. Waiver or reduction of fines in the case of code enforcement liens and interest in the case of special assessment liens may be considered. Priority shall be given to requests directly relieving financial hardships that result in the further deterioration of existing properties. 
(d)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus costs, may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the local governing body, and the local governing body, or the code enforcement board, may execute a satisfaction or release of lien pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the enforcement board may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Florida Constitution, Article X, Section 4. 
(Ord. No. 4955, § 1, 3-3-08) 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.09. 
Sec. 2-101. - Duration of lien. 
    No lien imposed pursuant to this division, shall continue for longer than 20 years after a certified copy of an order of the board imposing a fine has been recorded, unless an action to foreclose the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The local governing body shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien by the commencement of the foreclosure action is not effective against any creditor or subsequent purchaser for value without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
(Ord. No. 4955, § 1, 3-3-08) 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.10. 
Sec. 2-102. - Appeals. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, an aggrieved party, including the city commission, may appeal a final ruling or order of the enforcement board or hearing officer in the manner provided by F.S. § 162.11. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order being appealed. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any appeal rights under subsection (a), the city commission shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals from decisions of the enforcement board on requests for relief from special assessment liens pursuant to subsection 2-100(c). An aggrieved party must file a written request for an appeal within 30 days of the execution of the order being appealed. The request must be filed with the city clerk within said time period and must allege one or more of the following: (1) that the enforcement board denied the appellant procedural due process; (2) that the enforcement board committed legal error; or (3) that additional evidence not available to the appellant at the time of the hearing before the enforcement board may support a different outcome. Failure to file a written request for an appeal alleging one of the above factors within 30 days of the enforcement board's order shall constitute a waiver of the aggrieved party's right to an appeal. Upon receipt of a legally sufficient and timely appeal, the appeal shall be scheduled before the city commission. After consideration, the city commission shall rule on the appeal. The city commission shall affirm the decision of the enforcement board unless it finds that one or more of the allegations contained in the appellant's written request are true and that the appellant should otherwise be granted relief. The city commission may either grant relief or remand the matter for further proceedings before the enforcement board. A party aggrieved by a decision of the city commission under this subsection may appeal said decision in the manner provided by F.S. § 162.11.

(a)  All notices required by this part shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, return receipt requested; by hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector, or other person designated by the local governing body; by leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or, in the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. Provided, if notice by certified mail is sent under this section to the owner of the property in question at the address listed in the tax collector's office for tax notices, and at any other address provided to the city by such owner and is returned as unclaimed or refused, notice may be provided by posting as described in this section and by first class mail directed to the addresses furnished to the city with a properly executed proof of mailing or affidavit confirming the first class mailing. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a), at the option of the code enforcement board, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1)  a.  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the code enforcement board is located. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under chapter 50 for legal and official advertisements. 
b.  Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
(2)  a.  In lieu of publication as described in subsection (1), such notice may be posted at least ten days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be city hall. 
b.  Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(3)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a). 
    Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection (a), together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (b), shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this part have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.

(a)  The enforcement board shall be bound by and rely upon the decision of any other board of the city responsible for administering or interpreting any code or ordinance subject to this division. 
(b)  Any board of the city responsible for administering or interpreting any code or ordinance subject to this division shall be bound by and rely upon any prior decision of the enforcement board concerning the code or ordinances being considered by that board. 
(c)  A variance from the provisions of any code subject to this division shall not extinguish any violation of that code prior to the approval of such a variance, nor bar any enforcement action under this division for such violation. 
(Ord. No. 4955, § 1, 3-3-08) 
Sec. 2-105. - Supplemental remedy. 
    Nothing in this division prohibits the city from enforcing any code by other means. This division provides an additional or supplemental means for obtaining compliance with city codes. 
(Ord. No. 4955, § 1, 3-3-08) 
Sec. 2-106. - Perfection of demolition special assessment liens. 
(a)  (1)  If the owner of property subject to a demolition order of the enforcement board fails to either repair or demolish the structure or structures subject to said order within the time period given by the enforcement board to do so, if any, the city may cause the structure(s) to be demolished and removed from the property. Upon completion of the demolition and removal of the violative structure(s) by the city, the city shall mail an invoice to the property owner requesting payment to the city for the actual costs of the completed demolition and removal of the structure(s), plus any administrative charges in effect at the time of the mailing of the invoice. The property owner shall be required to pay the amount of the invoiced charges within 30 days of the invoice date. 
(2)  If the property owner fails to pay the charges within 30 days, the code enforcement division shall cause a resolution to be prepared designating the name and address of the owner, a description of the lots or land and the charges to be assessed against such lots or land for the demolition and removal of the violative structure(s). The resolution shall be presented to the city commission by the city attorney and, upon approval of the resolution by the city commission, the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure(s) shall be assessed against the property and shall be and remain a lien against such property prior to all other liens or interests, save and except taxes, and shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum, from the date the resolution is approved by the city commission. 
(b)  Before adoption of the resolution specified in subsection (a), the city commission shall cause to be published a notice directed to the owner(s) of the subject property, designating a time and place where complaints will be heard with reference to the proposed assessment and when such assessment will be finally approved and confirmed by the city commission. A copy of such notice shall be served upon the property owner(s) by first class U.S. mail at the owner's last known address as same appears on the records of the property appraiser of the county. The failure to mail such notice or notices shall not invalidate any of the proceedings under this division. 
(c)  At the time and place designated in the notice provided in subsection (b), the city commission shall meet as an equalizing board to hear and consider any and all complaints as to such assessment and shall adjust and equalize the assessment, and when so equalized and approved and the resolution specified in subsection (a) adopted, such assessment shall stand confirmed and be and remain a legal, valid and binding lien upon the property against which such assessment is made until paid. 
(d)  To the extent not inconsistent with general or special law, special assessment liens created and perfected pursuant to the provisions set forth herein and unrecorded at the time of the filing for record of a notice of lis pendens against the subject property shall nonetheless be enforceable against the subject property and shall have the priority specified herein if the city's interest or lien did not arise until after the filing for record of such notice of lis pendens.

    Alarm system means any mechanical, electrical, or radio-controlled device which is designated to be used for the detection of any unauthorized entry into a building, structure or facility, or for alerting others to the commission of an unlawful act within a building, structure or facility, or both; or which emits a sound or transmits a signal or message when activated; or any such device which emits a sound or transmits a signal or message when activated because of smoke, heat or fire. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, alarm systems shall be deemed to include audible alarms at the site of the installation of the detection device, proprietor alarms, and automatic telephone direct dial devices or digital alarm communicator systems. 
    Automatic telephone dialing device or digital alarm communicator system means an alarm system which automatically sends a prerecorded voice message or coded signal, over regular telephone lines by direct connection or otherwise, indicating the existence of the emergency situation that the alarm system is designed to detect. 
    Enforcement official means the chief of police, fire chief, or their designated representatives. 
    False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or maintenance or because of the negligent or intentional misuse of the system by the owner, lessee, occupant or manager of the premises where the alarm is installed or because of negligence or misuse of the system by an employee, servant or agent of such person or any other activation of the alarm system not caused by a forced entry, attempted forced entry, or robbery; or not caused by fire, heat or smoke; provided, however, false alarm does not include alarms caused by acts of God or by external power failure or those alarms intentionally activated by an owner, lessee, occupant or manager of premises who visually observed or heard suspicious circumstances which would cause a careful and prudent person to believe that a fire, forced entry, robbery, or other felony was in progress at the premises protected by the alarm system. 
    Fee means the assessment of a monetary charge, as authorized pursuant to this article, to defray the expense of responding to a false alarm. 
    Owner means any person who owns the premises in which an alarm system is installed or the person who leases, operates, occupies or manages the premises.

A response to a false alarm shall result when any police officer or member of the fire department shall be dispatched to the premises where the alarm has been activated or learns of the activation of the alarm system, by any means whatsoever, and responds thereto by traveling to that premises. After responding to a false alarm, the enforcement official shall notify any person identified in the notice required pursuant to section 34-28 of the activation of the alarm system. If the alarm is audible and does not deactivate automatically, such person shall thereupon travel to the premises to deactivate the alarm system. Should the person notified fail to appear at the premises to deactivate the alarm system within one hour after being notified to do so, the city shall charge the owner a fee in the amount prescribed by resolution; provided, however, if the owner is prevented from deactivating the alarm for reasons beyond the owner's reasonable control, no such fee shall be imposed. Additionally, the enforcement official shall require the owner to make a written report, within seven calendar days of the date of the false alarm, on forms prescribed and provided by the enforcement official, setting forth the cause of the false alarm, the corrective action taken and the name, address and telephone number of any maintenance, repair or serviceman who inspected or repaired the alarm system following the false alarm, as well as such other information as the enforcement official may deem is reasonably necessary to determine the cause of the false alarm, or the corrective action taken or required in order to correct the cause of the same. Should the owner fail to submit the written report within the prescribed time, the city shall charge the owner a fee in the amount prescribed by resolution.

In the event an owner fails to pay any false alarm charge within 30 days after the date of invoice for same, the enforcement official may, at his discretion, determine that there shall be no response to any alarm activation by the alarm system which has been the cause for the false alarm billing until said invoice is paid.

Conciliation conferences shall be informal. 
(b)  The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties may be reduced to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall be signed on behalf of the board by the chairman or acting chairman. 
(c)  If the board determines that the complaint lacks reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this part, the board may in its discretion recommend that the matter be closed or order such further investigation as may be necessary.

The hearing shall be held not less than 15 days after service of the statement of charges and notice to the respondent signed by two members of the board. The interested parties may, at their option, appear before the board in person or by duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The board shall not be bound by strict rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity. The board shall keep a full record of the hearing, which records shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any principal party to the proceedings the board shall furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the board deems appropriate. The board shall make a finding of fact. 
(e)  The purpose and effect of the procedure before the board and of its findings is to obtain: 
(1)  The resolution of differences and postures which are not consistent with the law; and 
(2)  Where conciliation has failed to resolve the discriminatory postures, to clarify the issues and to assist an aggrieved person to formulate his case, if he elects to seek remedies afforded by the law, particularly, but not limited to the United States Civil Rights Act of 1968. However, if in the opinion of the open housing board such action is warranted, the matter shall be turned over to the state attorney for further investigation with a view towards filing charges against the offending party in the appropriate court. 
Nothing in this section shall prevent any person from exercising any right or seeking any remedy to which he might otherwise be entitled or from filing of any complaint with any other agency or any court having jurisdiction. 
(f)  The board shall have the power to subpoena alleged violators, witnesses and evidence to its hearings. The subpoena may be served by the police department of the city, by any person authorized by law to serve process or by any other person who is not a party and who is not less than 18 years of age. Subpoenas issued by the board may be enforced through proper judicial proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.

This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion.

If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund for all members and retirees of all city retirement plan for police officers. 
    City means City of Lakeland, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being re-employed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not re-employed as a police officer with the police department within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not re-employed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00 will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any re-employment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his re-employment.

(1)  The member is entitled to re-employment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five years. 
(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    In the event that a member of this system has also accumulated credited service in another pension system maintained by the city, then such other credited service shall be used in determining vesting as provided for in section 62-60 hereof, and for determining eligibility for early or normal retirement. Such other credited service will not be considered in determining benefits under this system. Only his credited service under this system on or after his date of membership in this system will be considered for benefit calculation. Any benefit calculation for a member of this system who is or becomes eligible for a benefit from this system after he has become a member of another pension system maintained by the city, shall be based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate in effect as of the date the member ceases to be a member of this system. 
    Effective date means June 1, 2009. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed police officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Police officer means an actively employed full-time person, employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 943.1395, who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic or highway laws of the State of Florida. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry into the deferred retirement option plan. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a police officer reportable on the member's W-2 form, excluding certain taxable compensation that must be excluded pursuant to state law and excluding certain taxable reimbursements for an employee's out of pocket expenses for tuition costs, mileage reimbursement, etc., plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered, or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions including unused sick and vacation pay lump sums but excluding special details paid for by a third party at a flat rate. That portion of unused sick pay included in this calculation shall be limited to the amount that is payable as a lump sum upon separation from service subject to limitations on the percentage payable and maximum lump sums payable as established by city policy, and limited to the portion of that benefit that could have been accrued pursuant to that lump sum payment policy over the same five-year period of time used to calculate average final compensation. Effective March 19, 2012, salary shall include no more than 300 hours of overtime in a calendar year. To the extent a members regularly scheduled biweekly work period includes hours in excess of the FLSA overtime threshold, those regularly scheduled hours are to be counted as one-half hours for purpose of determining the 300 hour limit. 
    Effective March 24, 2012, salary payments for unused sick and vacation time, shall be limited to the lesser of: 
(1)  The number of unused sick and vacation hours accrued by each member as of March 24, 2012 multiplied by the member's final hourly rate and payable pursuant to established city policy. 
(2)  The amount actually paid pursuant to established city policy. 
    Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the City of Lakeland Police Officers' Retirement System as contained herein and all amendments thereto.

(a)  The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibility for the proper operation of the system and for making effective the provisions of this division is hereby vested in a board of trustees. The board is hereby designated as the plan administrator. The board shall consist of five trustees, two of whom, unless otherwise prohibited by law, shall be legal residents of the city, who shall be appointed by the Lakeland City Commission, and two of whom shall be members of the system, who shall be elected by a majority of the police officers who are members of the system. The fifth trustee shall be chosen by a majority of the previous four trustees as provided for herein, and such person's name shall be submitted to the Lakeland City Commission. Upon receipt of the fifth person's name, the Lakeland City Commission shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the board as its fifth trustee. The fifth trustee shall have the same rights as each of the other four trustees appointed or elected as herein provided and shall serve a four-year term unless he sooner vacates the office. Each resident trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, unless he sooner vacates the office or is sooner replaced by the Lakeland City Commission at whose pleasure he shall serve. Each member trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the city as a police officer or otherwise vacates his office as trustee, whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing trustee. Each trustee may succeed himself in office. DROP participants can be elected as, but not vote for, elected trustees. The board shall establish and administer the nominating and election procedures for each election. The board shall meet at least quarterly each year. The board shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature and description. 
(b)  The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect a chairman and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the board. The trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and per diem as provided by law. 
(c)  Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board. Three affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board. A trustee shall abstain from voting as the result of a conflict of interest and shall comply with the provisions of F.S. § 112.3143. 
(d)  The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the system. The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the system shall be paid from the fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. In the event the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. 
(e)  The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to the following: 
(1)  To construe the provisions of the system and determine all questions arising thereunder. 
(2)  To determine all questions relating to eligibility and membership.

Sec. 62-54. - Finances and fund management. 
    Establishment and operation of fund. 
(1)  As part of the system, there is hereby established the fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system. 
(2)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(3)  All funds of the police officers' retirement system may be deposited by the board with the treasurer of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the treasurer of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the treasurer or clearly identified as such funds of the police officers' retirement system pension and retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the police officers' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(4)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
a.  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis; and 
b.  Receipts and disbursements; and 
c.  Benefit payments; and 
d.  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city; and 
e.  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever; and 
f.  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Lakeland City Commission to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
b.  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in the Florida Statutes to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including, but not limited to, common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than 25 percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities, unless the Florida Statutes, are amended to remove or change or this mandatory restriction. 
2.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually, and shall be followed by the board in making its investment decisions. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the code, and governmental plans under section 401(a)(24) of the code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
i.  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection 3., shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
ii.  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to subsection 3., shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan. 
iii.  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
c.  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. § 185.06, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
d.  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
e.  Neither the board, nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
f.  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
g.  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
i.  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this division, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
j.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
k.  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
l.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
m.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.

(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund as follows: 
a.  A Tier 1 member shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in an amount to be determined annually by the board's actuary which shall be the sum of: 
1.  The rate charged to Tier 2 members; and 
2.  The rate needed to pay for additional liability created by these Tier 1 members who chose Tier 1 over Tier 2. The contribution rates will be calculated to pay for the additional cost over the expected future remaining working lifetime of the remaining Tier 1 members. 
b.  A Tier 2 member shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of 11 percent of his salary. 
c.  A Tier 3 member shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in an amount determined annually by the board's actuary 
Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police officers of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five days after receipt by the city. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make contributions at least quarterly to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system, but not less than 14.95 percent of payroll subject to adjustments made pursuant to the actuarial gain sharing account. Additional amounts as may be required from time to time to maintain actuarial soundness shall be allocated to the city and members in a ratio of 1.000 to l.000, respectively. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded past service liability as provided in F.S. ch. 112, pt. VII. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions from other than a governmental source, (unless the source specifies otherwise) may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions.

    The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died.

If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In-line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in-line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection (2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (b)(2), the following definitions apply: 
1.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a nonhealth care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  "Occupational exposure", in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; pre-employment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a pre-employment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not in-line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 40 percent of the final year of pay of the member. 
    Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a police officer with the City of Lakeland shall have terminated. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(1)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this division may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
(2)  The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(3)  If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
(4)  The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsections 62-61(a)(1) or (a)(2) (Optional forms of benefits), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(g)  Workers' compensation. When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed 100 percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation or 23/4 percent of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09; Ord. No. 5638 , § 4, 5-15-17) 
Sec. 62-60. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined based upon the member's actual years of credited service , provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under pre-retirement death. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09) 
Sec. 62-61. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. 
Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations. (See Q&A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6.) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(4)  A member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
a.  Five percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 95 percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3) above. 
b.  Ten percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 90 percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3) above. 
c.  Fifteen percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 85 percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3) above. 
d.  Twenty percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum with the remaining 80 percent paid under the normal form or as per subsections (a)(1), (2) or (3) above. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
    Pop up option. Effective June 15, 2015, in the event that a retiree has elected a joint and survivor annuity form of pension and their joint pensioner predeceases them, that retiree may, in lieu of the option in subsection (b) above, elect that the survivorship benefit shall be deemed canceled and the retiree's annuity shall revert to the amount of the original normal form of benefit determined before the joint and survivor option was elected. The dollar amount of cost of living adjustments since the date of retirement shall be added to the revised benefit amount. The adjusted amount will be effective on the first day of the month following the death of the retiree's joint pensioner. An eligible retiree, by electing this pop up feature, consents to the actuarial adjustment of the retiree's retirement benefits sufficient to cover the cost of this provision. If a retiree chooses the pop up option, he may not change his joint pensioner, as provided for in subsection (b) above, after his first benefit check is issued. This pop up option may only be elected at the time of retirement. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 62-62. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 62-58. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 62-62 (Beneficiaries). 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 62-57(a), (Benefit amounts and eligibility), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09; Ord. No. 5157, § 5, 4-19-10; Ord. No. 5514 , § 1, 6-15-16; Ord. No. 5638 , § 5, 5-15-17) 
Sec. 62-62. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation of beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09) 
Sec. 62-63. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09) 
Sec. 62-64. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15th, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 185.221. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09) 
Sec. 62-65. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this division in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09) 
Sec. 62-66. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Internal Revenue Code § 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in code § 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code § 415(b)(1)(A), ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in code § 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Internal Revenue Code § 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to code § 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in code § 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a) above, then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Internal Revenue Code § 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Internal Revenue Code § 417(e)(3) does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Internal Revenue Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing § 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Internal Revenue Code § 417(e)(3) applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Internal Revenue Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing § 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and: (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62); and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Internal Revenue Code § 417(e)(3)(B) (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing § 417(e)(3)(B) of the code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) Section limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under § 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Internal Revenue Code § 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Internal Revenue Code § 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Internal Revenue Code § 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code § 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Internal Revenue Code § 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Internal Revenue Code § 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by § 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code § 415(b), so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 62-59 or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 62-58. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 62-59, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 62-58. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Internal Revenue Code § 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 62-66, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of this section, if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans; provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in section 62-77 and section 62-78, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Internal Revenue Code § 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code § 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of Internal Revenue Code § 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code § 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Internal Revenue Code § 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under § 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Internal Revenue Code § 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code § 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code §§ 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under code § 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code § 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Internal Revenue Code §§ 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k) or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code § 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Internal Revenue Code § 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Internal Revenue Code §§ 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a. herein, will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Internal Revenue Code § 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under § 415(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the employee plans compliance resolution system (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under § 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to Social Security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under code section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under code section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under code section 415(b).

Sec. 62-67. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code § 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2), "Elections". Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), and subsection (e), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Internal Revenue Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to sections 62-57, 62-58, 62-60 or section 62-61 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section (section number for pre-retirement death) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

Sec. 62-69. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This division establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby.

The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the police officer's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the police officer. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c)(3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state.

Sec. 62-75. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Internal Revenue Code § 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Internal Revenue Code § 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Internal Revenue Code §§ 401(a) or 403(a), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code § 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code § 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code; a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans.

The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans.

(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09)

(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service.

Sec. 62-78. - Prior police service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in section 62-51, the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a full-time police officer with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a full-time police officer for any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department in the State of Florida shall be added to his years of credited service provided that:

(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09; Ord. No. 5157, § 8, 4-19-10; Ord. No. 5638 , § 7, 5-15-17) 
Sec. 62-79. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section 62-79, the following definitions apply: 
(1)  "DROP": The City of Lakeland Police Officers' Retirement System Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
(2)  "DROP account": The account established for each DROP participant under subsection (c). 
(3)  "Total return of the assets": For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to subsection (c)(2)b.2., for each fiscal year quarter, the percentage increase (or decrease) in the interest and dividends earned on investments, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), of the total plan assets. 
(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a police officer, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection (4)a.1. above, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses or interest, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) when he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the member's salary for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the member and included as salary as defined herein, had the member retired under normal retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the member shall be deducted from the first payments to the member's DROP account. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system, nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in re-employment after retirement. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a police officer, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a police officer. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a police officer. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a police officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be debited or credited with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of 61/2 percent per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
2.  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
i.  The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this subsection is the total return of the assets held in the pension trust fund net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
ii.  For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return, plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable and prior to distribution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP with: 
1.  Less than 60 months participation, shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation date, plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution; or 
2.  Sixty months participation, shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation date, plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution, plus any investment earnings in the current quarter prorated to the day of termination. 
If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such nontransferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the police department. A member employed by the police department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits and will not accrue additional credited service except as provided for in re-employment after retirement. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). A member may elect, however, in such time and manner as the board shall prescribe, that his DROP distribution be used to purchase a nonforfeitable fixed annuity payable in such form as the member may elect. Elections under this subsection shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  In the alternative, the member may elect to participate in the City of Lakeland Police Officers' Retirement System Post Retirement Investment Account (PRIA), as provided for in section 62-82.2. 
c.  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 62-74. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare and distribute to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including, but not limited to, determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board, nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 62-79 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance, may elect a rollover or may elect to participate in the PRIA. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the system, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the system. Upon such cancellation, the system shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States Mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States Mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city, nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 62-79 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09; Ord. No. 5309 , § 2, 5-7-12; Ord. No. 5638 , § 8, 5-15-17; Ord. No. 5644 , § 1, 7-5-17) 
Sec. 62-80. - Re-employment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be re-employed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Re-employment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is re-employed as a police officer and, by virtue of that re-employment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being re-employed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon re-employment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. Upon re-employment, the member contribution rate for the re-employed retiree shall be the same as the other members during the subsequent employment period. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is re-employed by the city in a position other than as a police officer, shall upon being re-employed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the re-employed person, by virtue of his re-employment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (b) above, and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the re-employed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the re-employed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. 
(e)  After in-line of duty disability retirement. Any member who has qualified for a benefit under the in-line of duty disability retirement provision hereof may be re-employed in any position except police officer, and continue receipt of in-line of duty disability benefits. Such member shall be considered as an in-line of duty disability retiree and not be considered a retiree for re-employment purposes. 
(f)  Re-employment of terminated vested persons. Re-employed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(g)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for re-employment. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09; Ord. No. 5490 , § 1, 2-2-15) 
Sec. 62-81. - Actuarial gain sharing account. 
(a)  Seventy-five percent of all accumulated actuarial gains (net of losses) shall be used exclusively to provide additional benefit improvements in this system. Twenty-five percent of all accumulated actuarial gains (net of losses) shall offset the city's and members' funding requirements in a ratio of 1.000 to 1.000 respectively. 
(b)  Based on the actuarial valuation as of October 1, 2016 (revised July 10, 2017), for fiscal year 2017-18 only, the accumulated gains (net of losses) shall be used to provide additional benefit improvements as follows: 
(1)  The sum of $425,192.00 shall be distributed to retirees, including DROP participants, disability retirees, and beneficiaries of these groups, in equal shares. 
(2)  The sum of $425,192.00 shall be applied to reduce the member contribution for the plan year beginning October 1, 2017, subject to the collective bargaining process. 
(c)  Future additional benefit improvements funded by accumulated actuarial gains shall be made by plan amendment recommended by the board of trustees and adopted by ordinance of the Lakeland City Commission, subject to the collective bargaining process if applicable. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09; Ord. No. 5665 , § 1, 10-2-17; Ord. No. 5690 , § 1, 2-5-18) 
Sec. 62-82. - Survivor's benefits. 
    The provisions of the Survivor's Benefit Ordinance No. 4955, shall be applicable to current and future retirees as of the effective date under the City of Lakeland Employees' Pension and Retirement System. 
(Ord. No. 5095, § 1, 6-1-09; Ord. No. 5157, § 9, 4-19-10) 
Sec. 62-82.1. - Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; Florida Statutes chapter 185 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefit to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous sections of this plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. ch. 185, premium tax monies for each plan year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 185.35. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("share plan"), if any, shall be further allocated to the members and DROP participants as follows: 
(1)  Individual member share accounts. The board shall create individual "member share accounts" for all actively employed plan members and DROP participants and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each member or DROP participant hereunder. Each member or DROP participant shall have a member share account for his share of the F.S. ch. 185 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto.

(2)  Share account funding. 
a.  Individual member share accounts shall be established as of December 19, 2016, for all members and DROP participants who were actively employed as of December 19, 2016. Individual member share accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection (3) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the share plan for that plan year, beginning with the plan year ending September 30, 2016. 
b.  Any forfeitures as provided in subsection (4), shall be used as part of future allocations to the individual member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (3)a.

In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the share plan in any subsequent plan year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual member share accounts at the end of each plan year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
2.  On each valuation date, each current actively employed member of the plan not participating in the DROP, each DROP participant and each retiree who retires or DROP participant who has terminated DROP participation in the plan year ending on the valuation date (including each disability retiree), or beneficiary of a deceased member (not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
i.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be allocated to each member share account of those eligible for an allocation in an amount equal to a fraction of the total amount, the numerator of which shall be the individual's total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the total years and fractional parts of years of credited service as of the valuation date of all individuals to whom allocations are being made. Beneficiaries shall receive an allocation based on the years of credited service of the deceased member or DROP participant.

b.  Allocation of investment gains and losses. 
1.  On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
2.  Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date.

The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
c.  Allocation of costs, fees and expenses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
d.  No right to allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the F.S. ch. 185 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this section. 
e.  Members and DROP participants shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the plan year.

No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. 
(7)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable under this section 62-82.1 shall be paid only from the assets accounted for in individual member share accounts. Neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account benefits.

Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination request under Rule 62-625.410(2)(d), F.A.C., whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to, or scheduled to discharge to a WWF, shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in subsections (1)-(7) below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in subsections (1)-(5) below. New sources shall include in this report information on the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections (4) and (5), below. 
(1)  Identifying information. The industrial user shall submit the name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owners. 
(2)  Permits. The industrial user shall submit a list of any pollution control permits held by or for the facility. 
(3)  Description of operations. The industrial user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification (SIC) codes, of the operations carried out by such industrial user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the WWF from the regulated processes. 
(4)  Flow measurement. The industrial user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the WWF from each of the following: 
a.  Regulated process streams; and 
b.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of Rule 62-625.410(6), F.A.C. The control authority shall allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
a.  The industrial user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
b.  In addition, the industrial user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the pretreatment standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the industrial user shall submit documentation as required by the control authority or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
c.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for any of these applicable tests: pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organics, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorine residual, un-ionized ammonia, microbiology, specific conductance, and dissolved constituents (e.g., ortho phosphate, etc.). For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The control authority shall waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is technically infeasible. In such cases, samples shall be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the industrial user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
d.  The industrial user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with these requirements. 
e.  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities, if such exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the industrial user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of Rule 62-625.410(6), F.A.C., in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with Rule 62-625.410(6), F.A.C., this adjusted limit, along with supporting data, shall be submitted to the control authority. 
f.  All activities related to sampling and analysis shall comply with Chapter 62-160, F.A.C. 
1.  Sampling activities and laboratory analyses shall be performed according to procedures specified in "The Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities" (DEP-SOP-001/01, FS 2400, Wastewater Sampling), herein incorporated by reference. 
2.  To the extent possible, analytical tests shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 as of July 1, 2009, hereby adopted and incorporated by reference, or if the test procedure has been determined to be inappropriate for the analyte in question (e.g., insufficient sensitivity) the laboratory, with the approval of the industrial user and control authority, shall identify and propose a method for use in accordance with Rules 62-160.300 and 62-160.330, F.A.C. 
3.  Where sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question are not available or approved, or where the department determines that the sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other parties, for which method validation information has been submitted and approved by the department in accordance with Rules 62-160.430, 62-160.520 and 62-160.530, F.A.C. 
g.  The industrial user may submit a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
h.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling; methods of analysis; and test results for each component and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the WWF. 
(6)  Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative as defined in section 102-26 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the industrial user shall provide such additional pretreatment or O&M, as specified in a compliance schedule. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
(8)  Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with subsection 102-46(b) of this chapter and signed by an authorized representative as defined in section 102-26.

Sec. 102-48. - Permit subject to provisions, regulations. 
    The control authority shall control through permit, order, or similar means the contribution to the WWF by each industrial user to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. In the case of industrial users identified as significant under section 102-26, this control shall be achieved through individual control mechanisms issued to each such industrial user. Individual control mechanisms must be enforceable and contain, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Statement of duration (in no case more than five years); 
(2)  Statement of nontransferability without prior notification to the control authority and without providing a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator; 
(3)  Effluent limits, including best management practices, based on applicable general pretreatment standards in this chapter, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local law; 
(4)  Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and record keeping requirements, including identification of the pollutants to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency and sample type based on the applicable general pretreatment standards in this chapter, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local laws; 
(5)  Process for seeking a waiver for a pollutant neither present, nor expected to be present in the discharge in accordance with paragraph 62-625.600(4)(b), F.A.C., or a specific waived pollutant in the case of an individual control mechanism; 
(6)  Statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedules shall not extend the compliance date beyond applicable state or federal deadlines; and 
(7)  Requirements to control slug discharges, if determined by the control authority to be necessary.

Sec. 102-49. - Duration, renewal of permit; conditions. 
(a)  Permits shall be issued for a specified time period not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The significant industrial user shall apply for permit reissuance at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the significant industrial user's existing permit but not more than 180 days prior to the expiration of the industrial user's existing permit. 
(b)  The director may modify a WDP for good cause, including, but not limited to the following reasons: 
(1)  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements; 
(2)  To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of wastewater discharge permit issuance; 
(3)  A change in the WWF that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge; 
(4)  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the city's WWF, personnel, or the receiving waters; 
(5)  Violation of any term or condition of the WDP; 
(6)  Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting; 
(7)  Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to Rule 62-625.700, F.A.C.; 
(8)  To correct typographical or other errors in the WDP; or 
(9)  To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner or operator. 
(c)  The significant industrial user shall be informed of any proposed changes in the WDP at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new conditions in the WDP shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance expect in the case of imminent danger to the environment, public health, worker safety or gross misrepresentation by the permittee. 
(Code 1960, § 29.05.1(A)(4); Ord. No. 3243, § 5, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98) 
Sec. 102-50. - Modifications by permittee. 
    A significant industrial user may request a modification to its WDP by filing an application for same in the same manner and subject to the same requirements provided in section 102-46. 
(Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98) 
Sec. 102-51. - Transfer restricted. 
    Individual wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 30 days advance notice to the city and the city approves the individual wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the city must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
(1)  States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes; 
(2)  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
(3)  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing individual wastewater discharge permit [or general permit (optional)]. 
Failure  to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the individual wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer. 
(Code 1960, § 29.05.1(A)(5); Ord. No. 3243, § 5, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98; Ord. No. 5319 , § 2, 5-21-12) 
Sec. 102-52. - Changed conditions. 
    All industrial users shall notify the control authority in advance of any change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge that may result in pass-through or interference at the WWF, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under section 102-53. 
(Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98) 
Editor's note- Former § 102-52, which pertained to modifications, was repealed by Ord. No. 3960, § 1, adopted Sept. 21, 1998. See the Code Comparative Table. 
Sec. 102-53. - Hazardous wastes notification. 
(a)  All users shall notify the control authority and the department's hazardous waste and pretreatment authorities in writing of any discharge into the WWF of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of would be a hazardous waste under Rule 62-730, F.A.C. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, the EPA hazardous waste number, the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of such waste per calendar month to the WWF, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user; an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to discharged during the following 12 months. Users who commence discharge after the effective date of this chapter shall provide the notification not later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification of changed discharges must be submitted under section 102-51, above. 
(b)  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in Chapter 62-730, F.A.C. Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in Chapter 62-730, F.A.C., requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new department regulations identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the control authority and the department's hazardous waste and pretreatment authorities of the discharge of such substances within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this subsection, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98) 
Sec. 102-54. - Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. 
(a)  Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWF, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the industrial pretreatment section, a report containing the information described in section 102-46 of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in Rule 62-625.410, F.A.C., this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operations), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 102-46(c) of this article. 
(b)  The director may impose mass limitations on significant industrial users where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection (a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the significant industrial user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard or the WDP, whichever is most stringent. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in Rule 62-160, F.A.C., and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the EPA. Where Rule 62-160, F.A.C., or 40 CFR 136, does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in questions, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Industrial User Inspection and Sampling Manual for WWF's, April 1994, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the EPA. 
(Code 1960, § 29.05.1(B); Ord. No. 3243, § 5, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3331, § 3, 1-6-92; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96) 
Sec. 102-55. - Periodic compliance reports. 
(a)  Except as specified in subsection 102-55(c), all significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the city submit no less than twice per year (June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by (the superintendent) or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(b)  The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present, nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(2)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
(4)  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 102-26, and include the certification statement in accordance with subsection 102-46(c). 
(5)  Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(6)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the city must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the city for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
(7)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the city, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in subsection 102-46(c), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the industrial user. 
(8)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection 102-55(a), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the city, and notify the city. 
(9)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(c)  The city may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance reports [see subsection 102-55(a); (40 CFR 403.12(e)(1))] to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the (EPA/state), where the industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following: 
(1)  A value of 0.01 percent of the POTW's design dry-weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in batches. 
(2)  A value of 0.01 percent of the design dry-weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and 
(3)  A value of 0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local limits were developed in accordance with section 102-99 of this chapter. 
Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in the last two years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in section 102-26 of this chapter. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an industrial user with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the director, decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(d)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 102-46(c) of this chapter. 
(e)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(f)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by city, using approved test procedures, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 3721, § 1, 6-17-96; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98; Ord. No. 5319 , § 2, 5-21-12) 
Sec. 102-56. - Monitoring facilities; control manholes. 
(a)  When deemed necessary by the director, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial and/or commercial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer necessary to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be construction in accordance with plans approved by the director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by the user so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(b)  There shall be ample room in or near such control manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the user's own expense. 
(c)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the control manhole shall be built in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city. Any user wishing to change the compliance monitoring point, i.e., from monitoring a combined waste stream to monitoring separate streams, shall first receive city approval. 
(d)  Service connections serving industrial or commercial warehouse space shall make provisions either prior to completion or are hereby made aware that if a facility moves into a location inside the warehouse that requires monitoring or flow measurement, a "monitoring" manhole that conveys all flow from the establishment and no other flow from within the warehouse shall be installed by the owner at their expense. 
(Code 1960, § 29.05.1(C); Ord. No. 3243, § 5, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98) 
Sec. 102-57. - Pretreatment requirements. 
(a)  When required, users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards if applicable within the time limitations specified by the regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce wastewater acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be submitted for review to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(b)  No special agreements or arrangements shall be granted for accepting industrial wastes of unusual strength or character that are regulated under the national categorical pretreatment standards unless the industrial users can demonstrate fundamentally different factors as outlined in Rule 62-625.700, F.A.C. 
(Code 1960, § 29.05.1(E); Ord. No. 3243, § 5, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3331, § 3, 1-6-92; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96) 
Sec. 102-58. - Industrial monitoring program. 
(a)  The city shall establish an industrial monitoring program to monitor the discharge from users to the WWF. This program shall consist of periodic determination of the users' wastewater discharge characteristics through the analysis of wastewater samples. Monitoring shall be conducted by the user and/or the city in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth in individual industrial wastewater discharge permits. 
(b)  Significant industrial users shall report all monitoring of discharge testing. At a minimum, these reports are due once every six months unless otherwise specified in their individual wastewater discharge permits. The information submitted in the report shall be based solely on sample data collected during the reporting period only. 
(c)  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user shall notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if: 
(1)  The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(2)  The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the industrial user or the control authority receives the results of the sampling. 
(d)  All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require. 
(e)  When requested by the director, any user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days of the request through sampling and analysis of its wastewater discharged to the city. 
(f)  Laboratory analytical work in support of city monitoring will normally be done by city personnel at the city's WWF laboratory. The city may also provide sampling and analysis services for individual self-monitoring users for a fee. Should the city's facilities not be equipped for any special test or should the customer request analysis by an independent private laboratory, such tests shall be made and the cost thereof paid by the user. 
(g)  All analytical work shall be performed by a state-certified laboratory and comply with Rule 62.160 F.A.C. All sampling shall comply with the Department of Environmental Protection Standard Operating Procedures for Field Activities, DEP-SOP-001/01 (DEP-SOP-001/01, FS2400, Wastewater Sampling). 
(h)  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures. 
(i)  Users discharging abnormal but acceptable high strength wastes as identified in section 102-129, may be assessed additional charges for sampling and laboratory analyses; provided however, that such costs shall not be assessable if laboratory analyses indicate normal strength wastes. Charges for such sampling and laboratory analyses may be assessed daily where such tests indicate unacceptably high strength waste detrimental to the WWF. All users with a WDP shall be assessed for all sampling and laboratory charges regardless of the strength of the wastes. 
(j)  The following schedule of laboratory charges for services rendered by the city shall apply to sampling and laboratory work required in connection with the industrial monitoring program: 
(1)  Sample:

(Code 1960, § 29.05.2(L); Ord. No. 3243, § 5, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3501, § 1, 2-7-94; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 3721, §§ 3, 4, 6-17-96) 
Sec. 102-87. - Upset provision. 
(a)  Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) below, are met. 
(b)  An upset shall not constitute an affirmative defense to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(c)  Conditions necessary for demonstration of upset. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of an upset must demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset; 
(2)  The industrial user's facility was, at the time of the upset, being properly operated; and 
(3)  The industrial user has orally submitted the following information to the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, with a written submission to be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  Industrial user responsibility in case of an upset. The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Ord. No. 4653, § 4, 6-6-05) 
Sec. 102-88. - Bypass. 
(a)  Permitted bypass. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only to the extent necessary for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. Such bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c), below. 
(b)  Notice. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit a notice to the control authority at least ten days before the date of the bypass. If the industrial user does not know of the need for a bypass ten days prior to the bypass, then the industrial user shall notify the control authority immediately upon knowledge of the need for the bypass. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain: 
a.  A description of the bypass and its cause; 
b.  The duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass. 
(c)  Prohibited bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority shall take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no technically feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (b), above. 
(2)  The control authority shall, except when the FDEP acts as the control authority, approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(1), above. If the FDEP is acting as the control authority, then the industrial user shall notify the WWF of the anticipated bypass. 
(Ord. No. 4653, § 5, 6-6-05) 
Sec. 102-89. - Affirmative defense. 
    An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the general prohibitions established in section 102-96, and the specific prohibitions in section 102-97, where the industrial user can demonstrate that: 
(1)  It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference; and 
(2)  Either of the following: 
a.  A local limit designed to prevent pass-through or interference was developed in accordance with subsection 102-97(3), for each pollutant in the industrial user's discharge that caused pass-through or interference, and the industrial user was in compliance with each such local limit directly prior to and during the pass-through or interference; or 
b.  If a local limit designed to prevent pass-through or interference has not been developed in accordance with section 102-98 for the pollutants that caused the pass-through or interference, and the industrial user's discharge directly prior to and during the pass-through or interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user's discharge activity when the WWF was regularly in compliance with the WWF's permit requirements and applicable requirements for domestic wastewater residuals.

Secs. 102-90-102-95. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 4. - DISCHARGE REGULATIONS 

Sec. 102-96. - General prohibitions. 
    A user may not introduce into a WWF any pollutant which causes pass-through or interference. These general prohibitions and the specific prohibitions in this division apply to any user introducing pollutants into a WWF whether or not the user is subject to other categorical pretreatment standards or any federal, state or local pretreatment requirements. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(A); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96) 
Sec. 102-97. - Specific prohibitions. 
    In addition to any other prohibitions in this article, the following pollutants shall not be introduced into a WWF: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the WWF, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius, using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(2)  Pollutants which will cause corrosive structural damage to the WWF, but in no case discharges with pH lower than 5.5; discharges with a pH greater than 10.5. 
(3)  Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction to the flow in the WWF resulting in interference. 
(4)  Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the WWF. 
(5)  Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the WWF resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the WWF treatment plant exceeds 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) unless the department (FDEP), upon request of the control authority, approves alternate temperature limits in accordance with Rule 62-302.520, F.A.C. 
(6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through. 
(7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the WWF in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(8)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designed by the WWF. The city may accept certain types of industrial and domestic waste trucked to the WWF generated within the city's sanitary service area or through inter-governmental agreements, on a temporary basis. This waste shall meet federal, state and local discharge standards and shall operate under the requirements and limitations of a wastewater discharge permit (WDP). 
(9)  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair. 
(10)  Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the WWF, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the WWF's effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit. 
(11)  Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, demineralizer water and cooling condensate, noncontact cooling water or any unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the city. 
(13)  Sludges, screenings or other residues from the pretreatment or [of] industrial wastes. 
(14)  Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the city. 
(15)  Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the WWF's effluent to fail a toxicity test. 
(16)  Detergents, surface-active agents or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the WWF or its effluent. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(B); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3331, § 5, 1-6-92; Ord. No. 3501, § 1, 2-7-94; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 4653, § 6, 6-6-05; Ord. No. 5107, § 2, 7-6-09) 
Sec. 102-98. - Development of specific limits by WWF. 
(a)  Each public utility required to have a pretreatment program in accordance with Rule 62-625.500, F.A.C., shall continue to develop such specific limits as necessary and effectively enforce such limits. 
(b)  The WWF shall also, in cases where pollutants contributed by a user result in interference or pass-through, and such incidents are likely to recur, develop and enforce specific effluent limits for an industrial user, and all other users, as appropriate, which, together with appropriate changes in the WWF treatment plant's facilities or operation, are necessary to ensure renewed and continued compliance with the WWF's NPDES permit or sludge use or disposal practices. 
(c)  Specific effluent limits shall not be developed and enforced without individual notice to persons or groups who have requested such notice and an opportunity to respond. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(C); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 4653, § 7, 6-6-05) 
Sec. 102-99. - Local limits. 
(a)  No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in excess of the local limits for those pollutants which have been established for the City of Lakeland's WWFs using standard procedures, calculations and methods acceptable to FDEP to protect against pass-through, interference, protection of WWF employees, and adverse affects on wastewater residuals disposal. No industrial user shall discharge process waste streams, unregulated waste streams, or dilute waste streams in excess of the concentrations set forth by the director. Local limits shall be included as permit conditions and attached to each SIU wastewater permit issued. 
(b)  The established local limits are subject to change and shall be modified as needed based on regulatory requirements and standards, WWF operation, performance and processes, the industrial user base, potable water quality and domestic wastewater characteristics. Modifications to the established local limits must be reviewed and approved by FDEP prior to implementation. Implementation shall be effective 30 days from notice of acceptance of the modified limits by FDEP. Permitted SIUs shall also be issued an addendum to their wastewater discharge permit containing the new local limits. 
(c)  The established local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWF. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. At his or her discretion, the director may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations. 
(d)  A copy of the approved local limits is available upon request at the following water utilities department locations:

Sec. 102-101. - Discretion regarding certain wastes. 
(a)  If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in sections 102-96, 102-97, 102-98 and 102-99, and which in the judgment of the director may have a deleterious effect upon the WWF, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the director may: 
(1)  Reject the wastes. 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers. 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharges. 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges. 
(5)  Require payment to cover the added cost of a monitoring program to determine compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  If the director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the director and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(c)  If the director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to review by the director and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(G); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 4236, § 1(e), 2-4-02) 
Sec. 102-102. - Interceptors. 
(a)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing fats, oils and greases in concentrations close to or in excess of limits established in sections 102-96, 102-97 and 102-99, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(b)  To ensure that all grease, oil and sand interceptors are maintained and operated efficiently, the city has developed a grease interceptor policy. All grease interceptors within the city shall be installed, operated and maintained in accordance with most current version of this policy. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(H); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3501, § 1, 2-7-94; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96) 
Sec. 102-103. - Maintenance of pretreatment, flow-equalizing facilities. 
    Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be continuously maintained by the owner at his expense and effectively operated to the satisfaction of the city. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(I); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98) 
Sec. 102-104. - Performance of measurements, tests, etc. 
(a)  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by FDEP approved methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analysis involved will determine if whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. 
(b)  For all sampling required by this chapter, grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the sample must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in Chapter 62-160, F.A.C., and DEP-SOP-001/01, multiple grabs collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as follows: 
(1)  Samples for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; 
(2)  Samples for volatile organics and oil and grease may be composited in the laboratory; and 
(3)  Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as allowed in the department's approved sampling procedures and laboratory methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. 
(c)  Oil and grease samples shall be collected in accordance with subsection (b) above, unless the sampling location or point cannot be physically accessed to perform a direct collection of a grab sample. In these instances, the sample shall be pumped from the sampling location or point into the sample container using a peristaltic-type pump. All pump tubing used for sample collection must be new or pre-cleaned and must be changed between sample containers and sample points. The pump tubing shall not be pre-rinsed or flushed with sample prior to collecting the sample. The report of analysis shall indicate that a peristaltic pump was used to collect the oil and grease sample. 
(d)  The city reserves the right to utilize grab samples in lieu of flow-proportion or time-proportion composite samples to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards when, in the opinion of the director, they are warranted. 
(e)  All reports shall be based upon data obtained through sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report. These data shall be representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The control authority shall require a frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(K); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3331, § 5, 1-6-92; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 5319 , § 2, 5-21-12) 
Sec. 102-105. - Special agreements, arrangements. 
    Nothing contained in this division shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the user. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(L); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96) 
Sec. 102-106. - Maintenance responsibility generally. 
(a)  The customer shall be responsible for the maintenance of the building sewer; specifically all plumbing from the public sewer into and including the house plumbing. The city shall assume the responsibility for maintenance of that portion of the building sewer in public right-of-way or easement. The city shall have the right to inspect the building sewer and to cause discontinuance of water service to any property where the plumbing is not maintained in a sanitary and effective operating condition or if the public sewer may be harmed thereby. 
(b)  The city shall be responsible for the maintenance of the public sewer and for providing adequate service to receive the approved wastewater discharge from the building sewers. 
(Code 1960, § 29.06(M), (N); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96) 
Sec. 102-107. - National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
    Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections 102-107(5) and (6), and Rule 62-625.410(4), F.A.C. 
(2)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
(3)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit by using the combined waste stream formula in accordance with Rule 62-625.410(6), F.A.C. 
(4)  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with the section and Rule 62-625.820, F.A.C.: 
a.  Application. Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with this chapter. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the control authority. 
b.  Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the following requirements are met: 
1.  Either: 
i.  The applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471 specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or 
ii.  The industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. 
2.  Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease shall not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the industrial users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
3.  Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. If sufficient data does not exist, additional monitoring shall be required to determine eligibility for credit and compliance with pretreatment standards adjusted under this rule. 
4.  Credit shall be granted only if the industrial user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the WWF discharges. If the control authority desires to waive this requirement, the control authority shall submit a written request to the department for approval. The department will grant approval for the waiver if the control authority provides technical documentation that no environmental degradation will result in the receiving waterbody. 
(5)  When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the control authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director. The control authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections (5)a.1. through (5)a.5. below. 
a.  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
1.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
2.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
3.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
4.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b.  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
1.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
3.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (5)a.3. of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the (superintendent) will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
4.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection (5)a.1. of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the director: 
1.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 102-111. The industrial user must also be in compliance with subsection 102-111(b) regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
(6)  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section (102-107) in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(7)  Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
(8)  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the director within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate.

(Code 1960, § 29.06(Q); Ord. No. 3243, § 6, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96) 
Sec. 102-110. - Dangerous, accidental discharges; notice procedures. 
(a)  A notice shall be permanently posted by the significant industrial user in a prominent place on the significant industrial user's premises advising employees who to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer should such a dangerous discharge occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. Each significant industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the significant industrial user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the director for review, before construction of the facility. No significant industrial user who commences contribution to the WWF after the effective date of this chapter/ordinance shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been reviewed by the city. Review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the significant industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the significant industrial user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the WWF of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions. 
(b)  Evaluate, at least once every two years, whether each significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges. New significant industrial users must be evaluated within one year of being designated a significant industrial user. The results of such evaluations shall be made available to the department upon request. Significant industrial users are required to notify the control authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. If the control authority decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges. 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals and containment areas. 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the city of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under Rule 62-625.400(2), F.A.C., with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days. 
(4)  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(c)  Within five days following an accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.

Sec. 102-112. - Cleaning of private sewer lines. 
(a)  Any user who has any or all of their internal private sewer system cleaned, for any reason, shall cause to have any material generated during this cleaning operation removed. This material from the cleaning operation shall not be discharged into the city's sanitary sewer system. This cleaning shall include, but is not limited to the following operations: Pressure or jet cleaning; hydrocleaning; flushing of system with water or chemical(s); rooting; pigging; etc. The discharge of "recycle water" from the cleaner, with acceptable water quality (compliance with this chapter), may be allowed by the City of Lakeland during the cleaning operation. 
(b)  Prior notification of any cleaning to the city's industrial pretreatment section shall be required. Failure to notify the city and/or have any material generated removed, may be considered a violation of this section and be liable for enforcement actions by the City of Lakeland. 
(c)  In addition to any enforcement actions by the City of Lakeland, any user who causes any material from a cleaning operation or their system shall be required to have the city's sewer system cleaned, downstream of their connection to the satisfaction of the city's wastewater operations division at the users expense.

Sec. 102-126. - Sewer connection charges. 
(a)  A sewer connection charge shall be imposed by the city for each connection to the WWF as set forth in this section. 
(b)  There is hereby established and imposed a sewer connection charge, the amount of which will be established by resolution of the city commission, which resolution may be amended from time to time. 
(c)  Each connection of a building sewer to a service line from the city's sewer main within the corporate limits of the city shall be inspected by the plumbing inspector to determine its compliance with applicable ordinance and code provisions. 
(Code 1960, § 29.08.1; Ord. No. 3243, § 7, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98; Ord. No. 4236, § 1(g), 2-4-02; Ord. No. 4573, § 1, 9-20-04; Ord. No. 5203, § 1, 9-20-10) 
Sec. 102-127. - Wastewater impact charges. 
(a)  The intent of this section is to recover from new customers connecting to the wastewater facility(s) (WWF) a fee which represents such customer's proportionate share of the cost of providing increased sewage treatment or conveyance capacity. 
(b)  For each detached single-family residential dwelling unit, there shall be a wastewater impact charge. The wastewater impact charge, the amount of which will be established by resolution of the city commission, which resolution may be amended from time to time. 
(c)  For attached single-family residential dwelling units, multiple-family dwelling units and mobile homes, the wastewater impact charge shall be a percentage of the charge established in subsection (b) of this section, per unit, based on an annual day average. The capacity for each unit shall be 244 gallons per day, annual average. 
(d)  For industrial and commercial connections, the wastewater flow impact charge shall be based upon the gallons per day allocated by the city. Future fee schedules for the wastewater flow impact charges shall be established by resolution of the city commission. In determining such equivalent, 260 gallons per day, annual average, shall be equal to an equivalent residential unit. When in the opinion of the director the equivalent residential connections cannot be readily determined on the basis of accepted normal flow standards or experience, the wastewater impact charge may be computed on the basis of fixture-unit values as defined in chapter XIII, section 1304.1, Standard Plumbing Code. For the purpose of such computation, 16 fixture units shall equal one equivalent residential connection. Additionally, it will be at the discretion of the director to utilize historical data from similar sites to determine impact assessment for wastewater and water. 
(e)  When appropriate, the director of water utilities shall have the discretion to determine the applicable water capacity fee when specific water capacity has been allocated to a particular site or project. 
(f)  Full payment of initial wastewater impact charges shall be made at the time of permanent water service request from Lakeland, or in the absence of Lakeland water service, at the time the service location has the potential to generate wastewater as determined by the director of water utilities. 
(g)  Customers who had sewer service available to their property prior to the initial adoption of wastewater impact charges in October 1971, who were annexed into the city prior to 1972 and who were paying monthly sewer charges prior to 1985, are not subject to those fees for wastewater flows generated at that time. Each customer's wastewater flow for that time will be considered the baseline flow for that customer, and increases in flow over the baseline amount shall be subject to wastewater impact charges computed in accordance with the manner prescribed in subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section. 
(h)  Wastewater impact fees shall remain with the property on which they were paid or grandfathered and are not transferable with the structure, should the structure be moved from the property to a new location. The calculation of wastewater impact fees for customers whose operations consist of separately metered facilities located on contiguous parcels of property shall be calculated by combining the flow generated by all such facilities located on those contiguous parcels. 
(i)  Adjustments to the initial wastewater impact fees shall be imposed upon commercial/industrial customers when it is determined that their wastewater flows have increased significantly in excess of the flow on which their initial wastewater impact charge was based. Increased flow shall be determined by averaging users' flow in the month of calculation with the users' flows in the five consecutive months immediately preceding the month of calculation. Increments of flow in excess of 8,000 gallons per month shall be considered sufficient flow increases to warrant imposition of additional wastewater impact charges. Fees for increased flows shall be calculated in the manner provided in subsection (d) of this section using current fee amounts. 
(j)  In addition to the wastewater impact charge established in subsection (e) of this section, a high-strength waste impact charge shall be imposed upon industrial users as provided in subsection (l) of this section, whenever it is determined that the volume of equivalent daily flow of wastewater in combination with a strength, expressed in pounds, of BOD above 300 mg/l and/or total suspended solids above 300 mg/l and/or nitrogen above 40 mg/l, exceeds the baseline strength, expressed in pounds, established for each customer. 
(k)  Baseline strength of wastewater will be determined for industrial users in the following manner: 
(1)  For customers connected to the WWF after the adoption of this article, the baseline strength shall be based on a concentration, converted to pounds, of 300 mg/l for BOD, 300 mg/l for total suspended solids and 40 mg/l for total nitrogen. 
(2)  For customers connected to the WWF prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article was derived, the baseline strength shall be the highest value, expressed in pounds, determined by a six-month rolling average of equivalent daily flow of wastewater and of each of the constituents' strengths utilizing the previous 12 months of monitored experience. If previous monitoring has not been performed, 12 months' monitoring experience will be obtained to compute the six months' rolling average. 
(l)  The high-strength wastewater impact charge shall be $300.00 per pound of BOD, $70.00 per pound of suspended solids and $456.00 per pound of total nitrogen above the baseline strengths determined in subsection (k) of this section. Future fee schedules for the high-strength wastewater impact charges shall be established by resolution of the city commission, which resolution may be amended from time to time. 
(m)  Wastewater flow impact fees paid for trucked waste would be transferred with the relocation of the company. If the company were to relocate to a facility connected to the city wastewater system, the impact fees would be applied to the flow impact fees paid by the property. The impact fees would remain with the property from that point in time and not be transferable. 
(n)  In the event a company cites the city wastewater system in its emergency operations plan for disposal of trucked waste in times of emergencies, no wastewater flow impact fees will be initially assessed. They will be tabled until the time of actual disposal. At that time, the city will make a determination regarding the assessment of flow impact fees based upon the amount of loadings, duration of loadings, and all other factors. 
(Code 1960, § 29.08.2; Ord. No. 3243, § 7, 11-5-90; Ord. No. 3706, § 1, 3-4-96; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98; Ord. No. 4081, § 1, 9-20-99; Ord. No. 4236, § 1(h), 2-4-02; Ord.

Sec. 102-128. - Wastewater impact refunds. 
(a)  Commercial or industrial customers whose wastewater flows have decreased significantly from the flow on which their initial wastewater impact charge was based, may be entitled to a wastewater impact charge refund. 
(b)  Beginning on the effective date of this article and no less often than every two years thereafter, a review of each commercial and industrial customer, whose account has been active and held by the same customer for the preceding 24 months, shall be conducted. If the highest six-month rolling average during the preceding two fiscal year periods does not exceed the flow on which their wastewater impact charge is based, plus 30 percent, the customer may be eligible for a reimbursement of their wastewater impact charge. Accounts which exhibit irregular or increasing flow characteristics may not be entitled to a refund. A commercial or industrial customer whose wastewater account has been active for at least the preceding 24 months and has experienced a substantial decrease in flow may request a review of their account by the city to determine eligibility for a refund of wastewater impact fees. The value of this impact fee refund shall equal the difference between an amount equal to 70 percent of the actual amount of wastewater impact fees paid by the customer to date and an amount equal to the highest six-month rolling average flow during the preceding two fiscal year periods; provided, however, that the minimum impact fee charged to any customer shall be one equivalent residential connection (E.R.C.) per unit. 
(c)  For purposes of this section, and the receipt of any reimbursement, the "customer" shall be the person or entity in whose name the wastewater utility account currently is held, if and to the extent, that person or entity paid the wastewater impact charge; where the current account holder assumed the account of a previous customer, any impact charges paid by predecessors on the account shall be treated as if paid by the current account holder. Otherwise, and to the extent, that the amount of any reimbursement exceeds the amount of any impact charge paid by the current account holder, such excess shall be paid to the current owner of the property to which the service is delivered. 
(d)  If in the judgment of the director, there is a likelihood of an increase in flows, or there are irregularities in flow, the refund may not be offered. Subsequent increases in flows will be billed in accordance with subsection 102-127(j). 
(Ord. No. 3501, § 2, 2-7-94; Ord. No. 3960, § 1, 9-21-98; Ord. No. 4708, § 1, 10-17-05; Ord. No. 4936, § 1, 12-17-07) 
Sec. 102-129. - Standard rates for sewer services. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
(1)  Multiple dwelling unit: Any dwelling unit served in common with one or more other dwelling units by a master water meter. 
(2)  Single dwelling unit: Any individual dwelling unit served by its own water meter. 
(3)  Operation and maintenance. Those functions that result in current expenditures for operation, maintenance, and ordinary current repairs of the WWF and its facilities and shall include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, materials, labor, insurance premiums, administrative expenses of the city relating solely to the system, and such other reasonable current expenses as shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
(4)  Replacement. Expenditures for obtaining and installing equipment, accessories or appurtenances which are necessary during the useful life of the WWF facilities to maintain the capacity and performance for which such facilities were designed and constructed. 
(5)  Fiscal year. The accounting period commencing on October 1 and continuing to and including the next succeeding September 30, or such other annual period as may be prescribed by law. 
(b)  Uniform schedule of charges. The fees, rates and charges for the use of the system shall be sufficient to provide necessary funds for operation and maintenance, replacement costs, and debt service. Said costs shall be reviewed annually to ensure that there is adequate revenue to meet such costs and that such costs are proportionately distributed among all users of the system. By resolution of the city commission, a uniform schedule of monthly charges shall be established for the use of the services and facilities of the WWF, by each dwelling unit (residential and multiple-family), business establishment, public building or other type of private entity producing wastewater and trucked waste. When a change(s) in the uniform schedule of charges is necessary, a resolution will be prepared to establish the applicable fees, rates and charges. The city shall adopt the resolution establishing applicable fees, rates and changes at a regular meeting of its city commission with such agenda item being appropriately noticed and available for public review. 
(c)  Determination of wastewater flows. The determination of flow volumes for purposes of computing additional impact fees and volume component of monthly service charges shall be based on metered water consumption; however, such determination may be made by the installation at the user's cost and expense, of an approved operable wastewater flow meter. 
(1)  In the event that the customers flow meter is inoperable, an average of the preceding 12 months flows shall be used for the purpose of wastewater billing calculations. The use of the average flow for an inoperable flow meter shall only be used for two consecutive months. If, at that time, the flow meter is not operational, the customer shall be considered to be without a flow meter and billing shall be based on water meter consumption. If the customer is required to have a flow meter because more water is discharged than metered for consumption, then the customer shall be billed on the highest monthly flow reading from the past 24 months. 
(2)  Any customer who fails to keep their monitoring equipment is good working order as specified in subsection 102-55(b) shall not be grounds for the customers claim that the sample results and/or flow monitoring is unrepresentative of the discharge. 
(3)  Any customer that installs a wastewater flow meter shall be required to record and maintain daily records of actual water consumption and wastewater volumes including the time the readings were taken and the person responsible for reading the meters. These results shall be mailed, on or before the 10th of the following month, to the following address:

(b)  Surcharge upon wastewater impact fees for users outside the corporate limits. Any person requesting wastewater service at any location outside the corporate limits of the city shall pay a surcharge equal to 25 percent of the established wastewater impact charge in addition to such fees. 
(c)  Large users. Nothing in section 102-128 shall restrict the city commission's authority to modify such charges by special contractual agreement to serve major institutional, commercial or industrial establishments or major complex of such users to the extent such modifications are necessary to preserve an equitable distribution of the costs associated with the use of the sewer system. 
(d)  Abnormal strength wastes of commercial/industrial users. 
(1)  Discharge into the public sewer of certain waters or wastes is prohibited or limited under the provisions of sections 102-31 through 102-71 of this chapter. The term "abnormal strength wastes", as used in this subsection, shall refer to the degree of concentration of permissible waste material per unit volume of sewage discharged by the customer. A surcharge on monthly service charges may be imposed upon customers discharging abnormally high-strength sewage. 
(2)  Abnormally high-strength wastes shall be wastes containing a BOD above 300 mg/l and/or total suspended solids above 300 mg/l and/or total nitrogen above 40 mg/l. 
(3)  Additional charge for high-strength wastes: 
a.  An additional monthly service charge shall be imposed where the wastes from any institutional, commercial or industrial plant, building or premises contain an abnormally high BOD concentration or abnormal strength wastes. 
b.  The additional charge provided in this subsection shall be computed by converting the concentration in mg/l above 300 for BOD and TSS and above 40 for TN to total pounds, based upon monthly wastewater flow. The total charges per pound for BOD, TSS and TN shall be established by resolution of the city commission. 
c.  The determination of BOD, total suspended solids and total nitrogen concentrations for purposes of computing high-strength waste impact charges and high-strength waste monthly service charges shall be in pounds per day and shall be based on the averaging of tests performed on one or more samples collected per month of the user's wastewater discharge. The user may provide additional tests to be averaged with the city's data; however, such additional tests shall be performed by a certified laboratory. Sample schedules shall not be manipulated to produce average values not representative of the actual discharges. 
d.  In the event that the city is unable to collect a sample in any one month, an average of the preceding 12 months strengths shall be used. 
e.  Calculation of monthly service charges for a month in which a slug discharge occurs shall be based on a weighted average of the slug discharge concentration times the number of days of the occurrence and the nonslug discharge concentration times the remaining number of days in the month without the slug discharge occurrence.

that district.
Refer to the Official Zoning Map to determine the zoning district classification of the property. (Example: RA-4.)
Refer to Table 2.3-1 to determine what principal uses are permitted in that district.*
2. Determine the context sub-district classification of the property and understand the development standards
pertaining to that sub-district.
Refer to the Official Zoning Map to determine the context sub-district of the property. (Example: UNH) Each
context is divided into sub-districts according to the underlying zoning district. Refer to Article 3 (Urban Form
Standards) for the development standards pertaining to that context sub-district.*
(Ord. No. 5455, § 2, 07-21-14)
3. Understand the general site development standards.
Refer to Article 4 (General Site Development Standards) to find the rules pertaining to specific elements of site
design such as access management, landscaping, signs etc.
4. Understand the natural resource protection standards.

1.5 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
1.5.1 ESTABLISHMENT AND AUTHORITY
a. The city is divided into zoning districts and context sub-districts, the boundaries and
designations of which are shown in a series of maps, covering in combination the
entire land and water area of the city, and identified as the Official Zoning Map of the
City of Lakeland. The Official Zoning Map, together with all lawfully adopted
explanatory material shown therein, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to
be part of this Code.
b. The Official Zoning Map and amendments thereto located in the office of the
Community Development Department shall be the final authority as to the current
zoning and context status of all lands and waters in the city, and shall be the final
authority as to regulations set forth therein as applying to such districts.
c. Where SPI Districts created in accordance with this Code have the effect of
superseding previously existing districts or sub-districts or portions of districts, the SPI
District boundaries and designations shall be shown directly on the basic map sheets.
Where SPI Districts have the effect of modifying requirements, regulations, or
procedures applying in existing districts, but do not supersede such districts, the
boundaries of such SPI Districts may either be indicated by SPI designation to the basic
map sheet or by SPI District map supplements.
(Ord. No. 5455, § 2, 07-21-14)
d. Where the scale generally applicable to the basic map sheets or supplemental maps is
inadequate for presentation of details in particular areas, such areas may be
cross-referenced on the basic map sheets or supplemental maps to separate inset
maps drawn at appropriate scale. Other supplements, in the form of maps, indexes,
guides, illustrations, records, reports, interpretive material and standards may be
Article 1: Introduction and Use of this Code
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 1.15
officially adopted, directly or by reference, to facilitate administration and public
understanding of the Official Zoning Map, or of regulations adopted for the zoning
districts or context sub-districts or other divisions established thereby.
1.5.2 RULES FOR ZONING DISTRICT AND CONTEXT DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
a. Except as otherwise specifically provided, a district or sub-district symbol or name
shown within district boundaries in the Official Zoning Map indicates that regulations
pertaining to the district or sub-district extend throughout the entire area within the
boundary line.
b. Where the zoning district or sub-district of a parcel is not shown on the map, the
following rules shall apply:
1. Where a district or sub-district designation is not indicated for an area in the
Official Zoning Map, the area shall be construed to be zoned as for the most
restrictive adjoining district or sub-district.
2. Upon discovery of such omissions, the Director of Community Development shall
initiate the proposed corrective amendment.
c. Where uncertainty exists as to location of district or sub-district boundaries or other
areas delineated for regulatory purposes in the Official Zoning Map, the rules set forth
in d. through j., below, shall apply.
d. Where district or sub-district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
center line of streets, highways, or alleys or their extensions, street lines, highway
right-of-way lines, railroad right-of-way lines, or alley lines or their extensions, such
center lines or their extensions, street lines, right-of-way lines, alley lines or their
extensions shall be construed to be said boundaries.
e. Where district or sub-district boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot
lines or their extensions, such lot lines or their extensions shall be construed to be said
boundaries.
f. Where district or sub-district boundaries obviously do not coincide with any of the
aforesaid lines, and are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the center
lines or street lines of streets or alleys or projections thereof, or the center lines of
right-of-way lines of highways or railroads or projections thereof, or the lot lines or
projections thereof, such district or sub-district boundaries shall be construed as being
parallel thereto and at such a distance therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map. If
no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale
shown on the Zoning Map.
g. Boundaries indicated as approximately following mean high water lines or center lines
of streams, canals, lakes, bays, or other bodies of water shall be construed as
following such mean high water lines or center lines. In the case of a change in mean
Article 1: Introduction and Use of this Code
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 1.16
high water line, the boundary shall be construed as moving with the change, except
where such would change the zoning status of a lot or parcel, in which case the
boundary shall be interpreted in such manner as to avoid such change.
h. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the corporate limits of the City of
Lakeland shall be construed as following said city limits.
i. Where distances are not specifically indicated on any map in the Official Zoning Map,
they shall be determined by reference to the scale of the map.
j. In other circumstances not covered above, or where existing natural or man-made
features are at variance with those shown in the Official Zoning Map, or where the
map is illegible or unclear, or where interpretations based on the above rules appear
to produce contradictions or conflicts with the intent of the Land Development Code,
or upon request from the Director of Community Development or from any affected
property owners, or on its own initiative upon determination that inconsistencies or
uncertainties exist, the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall make a finding
and interpretation concerning the boundaries involved in accord with the intent and
purpose of this Land Development Code. In cases where such finding and
interpretation involves only correction to the Official Zoning Map or any official
supplement, and does not change the zoning of any lot, the Zoning Board of
Adjustment and Appeals may direct corrections without proposing an amendment to
the map involved. In cases where the zoning of any lot would be changed by such
correction, the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall initiate a proposed
corrective amendment and transmit its recommendations thereon to be considered
by the Planning and Zoning Board in accord with Article 12 (Administration and
Enforcement).
1.5.3 AUTHENTICATION AND LOCATION
a. Each basic map sheet and each overlay or supplemental element thereto contained in
the Official Zoning Map shall be authenticated by the signature of the mayor; attested
by the signature of the City Clerk, and bear the seal of the city, under the following
words:

(Administration and Enforcement). Any proposed amendment shall be identified by
Article 1: Introduction and Use of this Code
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 1.17
reference to the map sheet and/or supplement involved, in addition to legal
description or other property identification or such other information as is required to
make specific the application of the amendment.
b. Amendments shall be authenticated by entries on map sheets, supplements, or
schedule sheets affected, and a record of the nature and date thereof maintained.
Such entries shall indicate the date the change became effective, the number of the
amending ordinance, and an indication of the nature of the change sufficient to
facilitate specific identification.
c. No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map, or any information
shown thereon, except in conformity with the requirements and procedures set forth
in this Code. Any unauthorized changes of whatever kind by any person or persons
shall be considered a violation of this Code and punishable as provided by this Code;
provided, this provision shall not be held to foreclose action under other applicable
criminal statutes of the State of Florida against any person or persons alleged to have
made unauthorized changes in this Code.
1.5.5 RETENTION AND REPLACEMENT OF ZONING MAPS
a. At least one copy of all zoning maps, or remaining portions thereof, which have had
the force and effect of official zoning maps for the city prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Code shall be retained by the office of the Community
Development Department and preserved as a public record and as a guide to the
zoning status of lands and waters prior to such dates.
b. At any time the Official Zoning Map, or any portion thereof becomes damaged, lost,
destroyed, or difficult to interpret by reason of the nature or number of changes, the
City Commission may by resolution adopt a new Official Zoning Map, or any portion
thereof, which shall supersede that previously in effect. The superseding document
or documents may correct errors or omissions in prior versions, but no such
correction shall have the effect of amending the district designation of any property,
except where such replacement is accompanied by action in the form of an
amendment making such changes.
c. Where replacement does not involve amendment, replacing elements shall
individually bear a record of authority for such replacement indicating the number
and date of the resolution, the date of the replacement, and specific identification of
the material replaced, attested by the City Clerk.
d. Where replacement is accompanied by amendment, in addition to the entry indicated

2.2.3 INTENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
2.2.3.1 Single-Family Districts (RA)
a. It is the intent of the single-family districts to provide for single-family detached
residential development at a variety of densities and lot sizes that are consistent with
Article 2: Use Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.4
the existing and desirable future pattern of development in the city. Provision is
made for a variety of residential densities in order to accommodate different
residential preferences.
b. The use restrictions protect single-family detached residential development from the
encroachment of incompatible land uses. At the same time, provision is made for a
limited number of appropriate non-residential uses which may be established for the
convenience of residents while still preserving the overall residential character of the
districts.
2.2.3.2 Two-Family District (RB)
a. It is the intent of the two-family district to provide for two-family residential
development at intermediate densities which are consistent with the existing and
desirable future pattern of development in the city.
b. The use restrictions protect two-family residential development from the
encroachment of incompatible land uses. At the same time, provision is made for a
limited number of appropriate non-residential uses which may be established for the
convenience of residents while still preserving the overall residential character of the
districts.
2.2.3.3 Multi-Family Districts (MF)
a. General
1. It is the intent of the multi-family districts to provide for single-family attached
and multi-family residential development at a variety of densities which are
consistent with the existing and desirable future pattern of development in the
city. Provision is made for a variety of residential densities in order to
accommodate different residential preferences.
2. The use restrictions protect multi-family residential development from the
encroachment of incompatible land uses. At the same time, provision is made for
a limited number of appropriate non-residential uses which may be established
for the convenience of residents while still preserving the overall residential
character of the districts.
2.2.3.4 Mobile Home District (MH)
a. It is the intent of the mobile home district to provide separate areas for mobile home
development. Separate areas are provided because mobile homes are constructed to
different design standards than conventional dwelling units and the mixture of the
two has a destabilizing effect on both housing types. Separate areas for mobile home
development are also needed to allow for the provision of adequate emergency
shelter for mobile home residents in accordance with adopted policy of the Central
Florida Regional Planning Council.
Article 2: Use Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.5
b. Uses permitted by right include mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions.
Mobile home parks are developments in which individual mobile home pads are
rented, leased or held in condominium ownership by occupants. Mobile home
subdivisions are developments in which mobile home lots are individually owned as in
conventional single-family subdivisions.
c. Recreational vehicle parks are permitted as conditional uses. It is the intent of this
code that a significant number of recreational vehicle spaces not be included in
mobile home parks. Recreational vehicle facilities are prohibited in mobile home
subdivisions.
2.2.3.5 Office Districts
a. General
1. It is the intent of the office districts to provide for office developments at a variety
of sizes and intensities that are consistent with the existing and desirable future
pattern of development in the city.
2. The use restrictions provide primarily for office development. At the same time,
provision is made for a limited number of appropriate retail uses which support
major office complexes.
b. Low Impact Office District (O-1)
The intent of the O-1 District is to permit those office uses which meet the needs of
local resident and business populations and which have a low impact and are the
most compatible with adjacent residential development. Because most of the
permitted uses typically generate low traffic volumes per unit of floor area, this
district is appropriate for locations along thoroughfares where conflicts between site
access and traffic-carrying functions should be kept to a minimum.
c. Limited Impact Office District (O-2)
The intent of the O-2 District is to permit those office uses which meet the needs of
local resident and business populations and which have a limited impact but are still
compatible with adjacent residential development. Because most of the permitted
uses typically generate low traffic volumes per unit of floor area, this district is
appropriate for locations along thoroughfares where conflicts between site access and
traffic-carrying functions should be kept to a minimum.
d. Moderate Impact Office District (O-3)
The intent of the O-3 District is to permit those office uses which meet regional needs
for office headquarters and other large-scale office space. The uses permitted
generate relatively low traffic volumes per unit of floor area; however, they are
Article 2: Use Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.6
developed at a scale which makes them substantial traffic generators. This district is
most appropriate for sites which: 1) are located along thoroughfares which have
rights-of-way sufficiently wide to permit separate turning and
acceleration/deceleration lanes; and 2) are separated from single-family residential
development by natural features or other less intensive land uses.
2.2.3.6 Commercial Districts
a. General
1. It is the intent of the commercial districts to provide for office and retail
developments at a variety of sizes and intensities that are consistent with the
existing and desirable future pattern of development in the city. It is the intent of
this land development code that most new commercial developments occur
either in the Downtown or Munn Park Commercial Districts or in shopping centers
of various sizes.
2. The use restrictions provide primarily for office and retail development. However,
permitted uses do not include heavy commercial developments which have
environmental characteristics that make them more appropriate for industrial
areas.
b. Pedestrian Commercial District (C-1)
The intent of the C-1 District is to provide for office uses and a limited range of retail
uses primarily oriented toward the pedestrian. Permitted uses do not include some
sales and service uses which have characteristics that make them more appropriate
for more intense areas.
c. Highway Commercial District (C-2)
The intent of the C-2 District is to provide for a broad range of office and retail uses
primarily oriented toward the motoring public and development on relatively small
individual lots with exposure to high traffic volumes. The C-2 Highway Commercial
District is intended for locations along arterial and collector streets. The district is not
intended for shopping centers or large retail establishments other than as outparcels.
Article 2: Use Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.7
d. Neighborhood Center Commercial District (C-3)
The intent of the C-3 District is to provide primarily for convenience commercial uses
which serve the everyday shopping needs of the surrounding population and which
are appropriate for small shopping centers that are under unified ownership or
management. The uses are relatively high traffic generators and thus have significant
impact on surrounding uses and on the traffic-carrying capacity of access
thoroughfares. Certain complementary office, financial and retail uses are permitted
in order to provide flexibility in the use of property zoned in this district. The C-3
District is intended for sites which are located at the intersection of two collector
streets or at the intersection of a collector street and an arterial street. Mapping of
the C-3 District in any one location is intended to extend over an area of no more than
two acres.
e. Community Center Commercial District (C-4)
The intent of the C-4 District is to provide for a broad range of office and retail uses
serving a community-wide population and which are appropriate for moderate size
shopping centers that are under unified ownership or management. This district is
most appropriate for sites which are located along thoroughfares which have
rights-of-way sufficiently wide to permit separate turning and
acceleration/deceleration lanes. The C-4 District is intended for sites which are
located at the intersection of a collector street and an arterial street, or at the
intersection of two arterial streets.
f. Regional Center Commercial District (C-5)
The intent of the C-5 District is to provide for a broad range of office and retail uses
serving a region-wide population and which are appropriate for large shopping
centers that are under unified ownership or management. This district is most
appropriate for sites which are separated from single-family residential development
by natural features or other less intensive land uses. The C-5 District is intended for
sites which are located at the intersection of two arterial streets.
g. Downtown Commercial District (C-6)
The intent of the C-6 District is to provide for a broad range of office, retail and
residential uses appropriate for a central city business district, pursuant to and
compatible with adopted plans for Downtown Lakeland. Such plans guide the
development of a traditional downtown environment and emphasize the pedestrian
over the automobile within the core of the downtown. The C-6 District is primarily
intended for mapping in the Lakeland Downtown Development Authority District.
Development within the C-6 district is subject to design review.
Article 2: Use Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.8
h. Munn Park Historic District (C-7)
The intent of the C-7 District is to permit use and development of properties in ways
which are: 1) consistent with the economic role that the Munn Park area can play in
the continuing revitalization of Lakeland's downtown, and 2) consistent with the
overall historic preservation program of the city. Use regulations permit a broad
range of office, commercial and residential activities, but are somewhat more
restrictive than the use regulations applicable to the C-6 Downtown Commercial
District. In particular, vehicle-intensive uses are prohibited or restricted. Banks, very
high turnover restaurants, parking garages and parking lots are subject to special use
review, primarily to control vehicular impacts on pedestrian circulation. Motor
vehicle sales and service uses are not permitted. The C-7 District is primarily intended
for mapping in the Munn Park Historic District. Development within the C-7 district is
subject to design review.
2.2.3.7 Industrial Districts
a. General
1. It is the intent of the industrial districts to provide for industrial developments at a
variety of sizes and intensities that are consistent with the existing and desirable
future pattern of development in the city.
2. The use restrictions provide primarily for heavy commercial and industrial
development.
b. Light Industrial - Limited Commercial District (I-1)
The intent of the I-1 District is to permit the establishment of business park uses and a
limited range of industrial uses along with retail and service commercial uses that
support business park and industrial employment centers, subject to limitations
established in the Comprehensive Plan. The industrial uses permitted include those
which usually have the most limited external impacts. Such uses do not create an
appreciable nuisance or hazard. They are generally compatible with non-industrial
uses, but they are more tolerable adjacent to non-industrial uses than are more
intensive industrial uses.
c. Medium Industrial District (I-2)
The intent of the I-2 District is to permit the establishment of a broad range of
business park, industrial and wholesale uses. Any retail shall be limited and
subordinate to the principal use. The uses permitted include those which usually have
relatively moderate external impacts. Such uses do not create an appreciable
nuisance or hazard. The I-2 District also provides for some industrial uses which
typically have more external impacts, subject to conditional use review.
Article 2: Use Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.9
d. Heavy Industrial District (I-3)
The intent of the I-3 District is to permit the establishment of industrial and wholesale
uses which often have significant external impacts because of their appearance
and/or their potential for generating noise, vibration, odor, glare, fire, explosion, or air
or water quality threats. Uses permitted in the I-3 District can create an appreciable
nuisance or hazard. In addition to these uses, the I-3 district also permits the same
light industrial uses and non-industrial uses permitted in the I-2 District.
2.2.3.8 Limited Development District (LD)
a. It is the intent of the limited development district to limit development in accordance
with the future land use designation of the area. The LD district provides for rural,
agricultural, conservation and recreation land uses where appropriate and where
consistent with the existing and desirable future pattern of development. The LD
district is intended for mapping in areas designated on the Future Land Use Map of
the Comprehensive Plan as follows.
b. In areas designated P (Preservation), the LD district may be utilized to prohibit most
development. Such areas may have significant wetlands, floodplains, wildlife habitat,
poor soils or other natural characteristics that make them inherently unsuitable for
development.
c. In areas designated C (Conservation), the LD district may be utilized to limit most
types of development. Such areas may have natural or environmental constraints
that can only support low intensity uses.
d. In areas designated R (Recreation), the LD district may be utilized to limit
development to passive and active recreation facilities and uses that are compatible
therewith. Such areas may be identified for use as parks, open space and lakeshore
parkways.
e. In all other Future Land Use designations, the LD district may be utilized to conserve
rural, agricultural and undeveloped land where development at suburban or urban
intensities is not desirable or it may be utilized as a holding zone where development
at suburban or urban intensities is not presently feasible due to an inability to provide
urban services or for other reasons. If and when more intense development is both
desirable and feasible in such areas, rezoning shall be required.
f. The LD District is intended for land which is mapped Preservation Area or Rural
Conservation by Polk County prior to annexation by the city.
Article 2: Use Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.10
2.2.4 RELATIONSHIP OF ZONING DISTRICTS TO FUTURE LAND USE MAP DESIGNATIONS
a. In accordance with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan, zoning districts may be
applied to the Official Zoning Map only within specific Future Land Use Map
designations in accordance with Table 2.2-1. Indication that a zoning district may be
applied within a particular future land use designation does not signify an entitlement
to that zoning. The application of zoning is limited by the goals and policies of the
Comprehensive Plan and subject to the technical and procedural requirements set
forth in Article 12 (Administration and Enforcement).
(Ord. No. 5455, § 2, 07-21-14)
b. Zoning districts applicable within Special Public Interest (SPI) Districts or Planned Unit
Development (PUD) zoning districts shall be in accordance with this section unless
otherwise specified in the ordinance establishing the SPI District or PUD.

Article 2: Regulation of Use
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.21
2.3.2 PROHIBITED USES
Any use not listed as permitted as a principal use in Table 2.3-1 or Table 2.3-3 or as
an accessory use in Table 2.3-2 or Table 2.3-3 shall be prohibited unless it is
determined by the Director of Community Development to be essentially the
same as a use permitted within the same district.
(Ord. No. 5721, 06-18-18)
2.4 CONDITIONAL USES
2.4.1 INTENT
It is the intent of this section to set forth standards for conditional uses. These standards
are intended to provide an opportunity to use property for activities which, under usual
circumstances, could be incompatible with or detrimental to adjacent existing or
permitted land uses and cannot normally be permitted within the same district, but which
can be permitted under circumstances particular to the proposed location and subject to
conditions which provide protection to adjacent land uses and the public welfare.
2.4.2 INTERPRETATION OF CONDITIONAL USE STANDARDS
Uses set forth in this Code as conditional uses shall be deemed to be adverse to the public
interest and welfare except in specific instances when the City Commission finds that all
land development code standards for approval of such uses will be met. In those instances
when the City Commission finds that all land development code standards for approval of
a particular conditional use at a specific location have been met, and the public welfare is
adequately protected, then the City Commission shall approve the use. The application
procedures for conditional uses are set forth in Section 12.5.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
2.4.3 GENERAL CONDITIONAL USE STANDARDS
Prior to approving any conditional use, the City Commission shall find, based on
competent and substantial evidence, that the use exactly as proposed at the location
where proposed, will be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and compatible with
existing uses and uses most likely to occur in the immediate area, and will provide for the
adequate protection of the public welfare. The proposed use shall not result in premature
development nor shall it substantially reduce the public benefit that would result from use
of the same site by a use permitted by right.
Article 2: Regulation of Use
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.22
2.4.4 SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES
a. Prior to approving any conditional use, the City Commission shall find, based on
competent and substantial evidence, that the proposed use will not reduce the level
of service or result in a significantly greater amount of through traffic on local streets
than would result from development of a use permitted by right or otherwise be
detrimental to the public welfare. The proposed use will be appropriately located
with respect to the thoroughfare system and in relation to water lines, sanitary
sewers, storm sewers, surface drainage systems and other utility systems that it will
result in neither extension nor enlargement nor any other alteration of such systems
in a manner resulting in higher net public cost or earlier incursion of public cost than
would result from development of a use permitted by right.
b. The proposed use will not place a demand on municipal police or fire protection
services beyond the capacity of those services, except that the proposed use may
place a demand on municipal police or fire protection services that does not exceed
the demand likely to result from a development permitted by right.
2.4.5 STANDARDS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL CONDITIONAL USES IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
a. Prior to approving any non-residential conditional use in any residential district and
prior to approving any more intensive residential conditional use in a less intensive
residential district, the City Commission shall find, based on competent and
substantial evidence, that the size and location of the conditional use, along with the
nature and intensity of the operations involved, will be compatible with the
predominantly residential character of the district and not hazardous or inconvenient
to surrounding residents or injurious to the long range development of the district for
the residential purposes.
b. The location of the conditional use will not result in a small existing or planned
residential area being isolated from other residential areas by being completely or
largely surrounded by arterial streets and non-residential land uses.
c. The design of buildings for non-residential conditional uses in residential districts shall
be compatible with that of residential structures in the same general area or
neighborhood. Such a finding shall be based on a consideration of the building mass,
height, materials, window arrangement, yards, landscaping and any other pertinent
considerations.
d. The maximum height of broadcast and transmission towers in residential districts shall
be one foot in height for each one foot in setback from any lot line. Broadcast and
transmission towers are not personal wireless service facilities which are regulated in
accordance with Section 5.18.
(Ord. No. 5455, § 2, 07-21-14)
Article 2: Regulation of Use
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.23
2.4.6 CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS
Prior to granting approval for a use subject to special conditions, the City Commission may
impose any additional conditions or limitations upon the establishment, location,
construction, landscaping, maintenance or operation of the use authorized by the
approval as in its judgment may be reasonably necessary to prevent the use from being
detrimental to other permitted land uses adjacent to or in the surrounding area of the
conditional use, and for the protection of the public interest and welfare. Conditions and
requirements stated as part of the approval of a conditional use shall be a continuing
obligation of holders of approval. The Director of Community Development may make
investigations of developments authorized as conditional uses to determine compliance
with the approved conditions.
2.4.7 CHANGES TO CONDITIONAL USE
a. A conditional use shall be approved for the benefit of the person or entity for whom
application was made. The character of the conditional use shall not be changed
without a new conditional use and the benefit of the conditional use shall not be
transferred to another person or entity without the approval of the Director of
Community Development. The Director of Community Development may, at his
discretion, request a resolution of the City Commission on any request to change or
transfer a conditional use.
b. Proposed changes to an approved conditional use, including changes to conditions,
site development plans or any other provision incorporated as part of the ordinance
enacting a conditional use for a particular parcel or parcels, shall be reviewed by the
Director of Community Development to determine whether the change is a major or
minor modification from previously approved plans or conditions. Any modification of
an approved conditional use which involves a change to a more intensive use shall be
considered a major modification. Other modifications may be declared major
modifications if the Director of Community Development determines they deviate
substantially from the approved conditional use. Requests for major modifications
shall follow the same procedure set forth herein for conditional use approval. Any
proposed change to a conditional use which does not constitute a major modification
shall be considered a minor modification. At the discretion of the Director of
Community Development, minor modifications may be referred to the Planning and
Zoning Board with a recommendation or, if the Director of Community Development
deems the proposed change to be de minimus, he may make the minor modification
administratively.
c. Action by the Planning & Zoning Board or Director of Community Development in
such cases shall be final. Requests for minor modifications shall be made in writing
and shall indicate the effect of the proposed changes, the reasons why the changes
are necessary, and, if applicable, shall include a revised site development plan.
Article 2: Regulation of Use
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 2.24
2.4.8 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF CONDITIONAL USE IF CONSTRUCTION NOT
COMMENCED
Failure to commence construction within five years of the effective date of the adoption
of a conditional use shall be grounds for the city, at its discretion, to repeal the conditional
use, modify the conditional use or retain the conditional use in its current form.
2.5 TEMPORARY USES
2.5.1 GENERAL
In all zoning districts, the temporary uses listed below shall be permitted subject to
approval by the Director of the Community Development Department on a case by case
basis. Prior to approving any temporary use, the Director shall find, based on competent
and substantial evidence, that the use exactly as proposed at the location where
proposed and in accordance with such conditions he may impose, will be in conformity
with the Comprehensive Plan and compatible with existing uses and uses most likely to
occur in the immediate area, and will provide for the adequate protection of the public
welfare.

2.6 MASTER USE LIST
2.6.1 INTENT
It is the intent of this article to provide a master list of all uses addressed by this land
development code and definitions for the uses that require such definitions. Some uses
are further defined in Article 5 (Regulation of Specific Uses) and elsewhere in this code.
2.6.2 SIGNIFICANCE OF STANDARD INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS
Some industrial, warehouse, wholesale and transportation uses in the Master Use List are
described or defined by reference to a U.S. Government Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) code number or numbers. (The Standard Industrial Classification system is available
on several U.S. Government agency web sites.) When the use is identified by the phrase
"as listed in SIC group" followed by a number, the identification has no regulatory
significance; it is provided for information only. When the use is identified by the phrase
"including all uses listed in SIC group" followed by a number, the identification has
regulatory significance; it means the use identified includes all the uses listed in the
specified SIC group and that all those uses are permitted wherever the named use is
permitted. When the use is identified by the phrase "including the following uses listed in
SIC group" followed by a number and a list of uses, the identification has regulatory
significance in that the list of uses that follow the SIC group number are included in the
previously named use and that all those uses are permitted wherever the named use is
permitted. However, no other uses, from the indicated SIC, group are permitted.

implement the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan; to create a
compact, walkable, energy-efficient, transit-supportive urban form; to encourage a
diverse mix of land uses and to ensure a high quality public realm. The elements of
urban form include streets, blocks, lots and parcels, buildings and structures and open
spaces.
3.1.2 APPLICABILITY
a. Except as otherwise provided herein, no building, structure, or land located within the
city shall hereafter be used or occupied except in conformity with the urban form
standards of this article for the context sub-district classification of the property as
depicted on the Official Zoning Map.
b. Applicability of Certain Urban Form Standards
Certain urban form standards set forth in this article are intended for development of
undeveloped sites and for substantial alteration or redevelopment of developed sites.
They are not intended for minor or incidental expansions or changes to existing
development. Therefore, the following urban form standards shall apply only under
the circumstances indicated. In the case of a multi-building complex containing more
than one principal building, these urban form standards shall apply only to the new,
enlarged or renovated principal building.
1. Maximum Block Face, Maximum Block Perimeter
(a) Upon the creation of any new block.
(b) Upon the redevelopment of any existing block in such a way that allows the
introduction of new public or private roads to create conforming blocks, as
determined by the Director of Community Development.
2. Maximum Lot Width and Maximum Lot Area
Upon the creation of any new lot or parcel.
3. Maximum Building Setbacks, Frontage Buildout
Upon the construction of a principal building.
4. Parking Location
Article 3: Urban Form Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 3.2
(a) Upon the construction of a principal building, except where the Director of
Community Development shall determine a conforming parking location is
not feasible due to physical site constraints or to maintain existing cross
access connections.
(b) Upon the redevelopment of any existing development in such a way that
allows the minimum amount of code-required off street parking to be
provided in a conforming location or locations, as determined by the Director
of Community Development.
5. Entrance Feature
(a) Upon the construction of any principal building.
(b) Upon enlargement by 50 percent or more of the existing gross floor area of
any existing principal building or of the total of all principal buildings in the
case of a site legally containing more than one principal building.
(c) Upon renovation valuing 75 percent or more of the current assessed value of
any existing principal building or of the total of all principal buildings in the
case of a site legally containing more than one principal building.
6. Civic Open Space

any existing building, complex of buildings or project triggering the civic open
space requirements.
(d) Upon renovation valuing 75 percent or more of the current assessed value of
any existing building, complex of buildings or project triggering the civic open
space requirements.
c. Applicability With Respect to PUDs and SPI Districts
To the extent that any adopted Planned Unit Development (PUD) or Special Public
Interest (SPI) District provides specific development standards or regulations, those
development standards or regulations shall prevail. To the extent that any adopted
Planned Unit Development or SPI District does not provide such development
standards or regulations, the urban form standards set forth in this article shall
apply in accordance with the context sub-district that most closely approximates the
intent of the PUD or SPI District as the Director of Community Development shall
determine.
(Ord. No. 5455, § 2, 07-21-14)
Article 3: Urban Form Standards
3.2 ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTEXT DISTRICTS
3.2.1 GENERAL
Context Districts and their associated standards describe the general form of the desired
built environment and are referred to herein as context districts or contexts. Contexts
may be assigned to perpetuate the existing character or pattern of development of an
area or to encourage change to a more desirable character or pattern of development.
A primary distinction is made between areas that are urban in character and those that
are suburban in character. Urban contexts generally exhibit a more fine-grained built
environment with higher densities, a more well-connected street pattern, smaller
blocks, smaller parcels and shorter setbacks relative to suburban contexts. The urban
and suburban areas are classified into Neighborhoods, Centers, Corridors and Special
Purpose contexts. There is also one Preservation, Conservation, Recreation context. The
contexts are further classified into context sub-districts according to the underlying
zoning districts to account for development patterns that were established when the
zoning districts governed physical development under previous codes.
3.2.1.1 Context Districts Enumerated
The City of Lakeland is divided into the following context districts and context sub-districts
for the purpose of regulating urban form. The context sub-districts coincide with specific
underlying zoning districts as indicated by sets of parentheses. For example, SNH (RA-3,
RA-4) is a discrete context sub-district to which specific development regulations apply.

3.2.2 INTENT OF CONTEXT DISTRICTS
3.2.2.1 Urban Neighborhood (UNH) District
The UNH district is intended to describe urban residential areas where people live and
which incorporate facilities within walking distance for gathering, going to school,
worshiping, shopping for daily needs and recreating. The district is characterized by
moderate to high density development, a relatively small block structure, a highly
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 3.3
Article 3: Urban Form Standards
walkable environment and high connectivity. It is oriented toward public spaces such as
sidewalks and parks and may contain some civic and small-scale office and commercial
uses.
3.2.2.2 Urban Center (UCT) District
The UCT district is intended to describe relatively compact urban areas having land uses
that attract a substantial number of people for purposes such as shopping, employment,
health care, education, government services, entertainment and civic participation. The
district is characterized by moderate to high density development, a mixed and multiuse
environment typically consisting of retail, office, civic, and residential uses, a
relatively small block structure, a highly walkable environment and high connectivity. It
is typically served by urban, high capacity, slow-speed roadways.
3.2.2.3 Urban Corridor (UCO) District
The UCO district is intended to describe linear areas along urban, high capacity, highspeed
roadways and having typically retail or office uses with or without above-groundfloor
residential uses. The district is characterized by low to moderate density with
higher density within Transit Oriented Corridors, a relatively small block structure, a
relatively shallow parcel depth, a limited to moderately walkable environment and high
connectivity.
3.2.2.4 Urban Special Purpose (USP) District
The USP district is intended to describe generally single-use urban areas that
accommodate uses such as business and industrial parks or special facilities such as
hospitals and universities and may have supporting retail or service commercial uses.
The district is characterized by moderate to high density development, no consistent
block structure and a moderate to highly walkable environment.
3.2.2.5 Suburban Neighborhood (SNH) District
The SNH district is intended to describe suburban residential areas composed almost
entirely residential uses and characterized by low to moderate density development, a
relatively large block structure, a low to moderately walkable environment that requires
primarily vehicular mobility and has limited connectivity. The SNH district may
transition over time to a more urban form that is more walkable with smaller blocks,
greater connectivity, higher density and that incorporates facilities within walking
distance for gathering, going to school, worshiping, shopping for daily needs and
recreating, particularly within Transit Oriented Corridors.
3.2.2.6 Suburban Center (SCT) District
The SCT district is intended to describe relatively compact suburban areas having land
uses that attract a substantial number of people for purposes such as shopping,
employment, health care, education, government services, entertainment and civic
participation. The district is characterized by low to moderate density development a
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 3.4
Article 3: Urban Form Standards
multi-use environment typically consisting of retail and office uses, a relatively large
block structure, a low to moderately walkable environment and limited connectivity. It
is typically adjacent to suburban, high capacity, high-speed roadways. The SCTR district
may transition over time to a more urban form that is more walkable with smaller
blocks, more mixed use and greater connectivity, particularly within Transit Oriented
Corridors.
3.2.2.7 Suburban Corridor (SCO) District
The SCO district is intended to describe linear areas along major suburban roadways
having typically retail or office uses. The district is characterized by low to moderate
density development, a relatively large block structure, a low to moderately walkable
environment and limited connectivity. The SCOR district may transition over time to a
more urban form that is more walkable with smaller blocks, greater connectivity, more
mixed use and higher density, particularly within Transit Oriented Corridors.
3.2.2.8 Suburban Special Purpose (SSP) District
The SSP district is intended to describe generally single-use suburban areas that
accommodate uses such as business and industrial parks or special facilities such as
hospitals, universities, power plants, freight yards and airports. The district is
characterized by low to moderate density development, no consistent block structure,
and a typically low walkable environment. It is typically located on periphery of
developed areas and oriented toward major transportation facilities.
3.2.2.9 Preservation, Conservation, Recreation (PCR) District
The PCR district is intended to describe areas designated as Preservation, Conservation
or Recreation on the Future Land Use Map. These include major wetlands and other
areas having environmental constraints where little or no development should occur,
and lakeshores and parks where development is limited to park and recreation facilities.
Such areas have no consistent block structure, have generally large parcel size or are
contained within large parcels and often have meandering boundaries. This district can
be mapped in urban and suburban areas.
3.2.3 PROCESS FOR CREATING AND AMENDING CONTEXT DISTRICTS
Only the Community Development Department, the Planning and Zoning Board or the
City Commission may initiate proposals for the creation or amendment of context
districts. Changes to context districts shall be by the same procedure as for Code
amendments generally.
3.3 STREET TYPES
3.3.1 GENERAL
Streets are classified in accordance with roadway typologies adopted as part of the
Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Each type has a different function
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 3.5
Article 3: Urban Form Standards
and provides the framework for a different urban form. Consequently, some urban form
standards vary depending on the street type. Development that is required to construct
new streets in accordance with the block structure standards of Section 3.4, or
otherwise, shall do so in accordance with these standards, except where a variation is
specifically authorized as part of a PUD, SPI District or as approved by the Planning and
Zoning Board pursuant to Sub-Section 9.7.1.6. All streets and roads shall be constructed
in accordance with the City of Lakeland Engineering Standards Manual and Article 9
(Subdivision Standards).
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
3.3.1.1 Classification of Street Types
a. Public and private streets are classified according to the following types. The titles are
intended for the regulatory purposes of this Code only and are not synonymous with
words or terms used elsewhere to describe the functional classification, maintenance
classification or other classification of streets or roadways. Existing and planned
street types are illustrated in Figure 3.3-1.

b. Limited Access Roads
The city also contains high speed limited-access freeways and expressways. These
roads are shown on Figure 3.3-1 but do not provide direct access to property or
bicycle or pedestrian facilities and are not included among the enumerated street
types.
c. Alleys
The city also contains alleys which are an important means of secondary access to
property, especially in urban contexts. Alleys do not provide the primary means of
access to property and are therefore not included among the enumerated street
types. Alleys may be constructed where appropriate but may not be used to create
a required block structure.
3.3.2 INTENT OF STREET TYPES
The intent of each street type is described in Table 3.3-1 according to its essential
characteristics. Each type is described as an ideal type and the specific characteristics are
desired or typical and are not necessarily present in all cases. Some design variation may
occur within the general classification of each street type. Other street types not listed
may be approved by the city if the Director of Community Development determines that
the alternative street type is appropriate in a particular instance.

3.3.4 PROCESS FOR CLASSIFICATION OF STREET TYPES
Only the Community Development Department, the Planning and Zoning Board or the
City Commission may initiate proposals for the classification or reclassification of street
types. Changes to street types shall be by the same procedure as for Code amendments
generally.
3.4 CONTEXT STANDARDS
3.4.1 GENERAL
Tables 3.4-1 through 3.4-13 set forth the minimum standards specific to each context and
context sub-district. Sub-Sections 3.4.2 through 3.4.5 describe each standard referenced
in the tables, explain how it is measured and provide additional details or criteria
regarding how it is applied.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
3.4.2 BLOCK REQUIREMENTS
3.4.2.1 General
a. Block Requirements describe minimum standards for the creation of blocks. It is
the intent of the Block Requirements to create blocks of walkable scale that form an
interconnected network of streets, maximize connectivity, minimize travel distances
and provide a framework for the subdivision of land and the placement of buildings.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
In general, the vacation of existing rights-of-way to create larger blocks is
discouraged.
b. When a development lot or parcel exceeds the maximum block face or maximum
block perimeter set forth in Tables 3.4-1 through 3.4-13, the development shall
provide public or private streets to form blocks meeting those criteria unless the
Director of Community Development makes a determination that the required block
structure in a particular instance is contrary to the desired development pattern or
that physical site constraints or lack of adjoining streets make the creation of the
required block structure impractical.
3.4.2.2 Block Formation
a. Block faces shall be measured from the outer parcel boundaries of lots or parcels
comprising the block or along the margins of continuous physical features such as
lakes, railroads and canals that may form the face of a block. Block perimeter shall be
the sum of all block faces that enclose the block.
b. Block faces shall be more or less rectilinear unless the continuation of existing streets
or physical site constraints provides no practical alternative as determined by the
Director of Community Development or unless block alternatives are specifically
provided in an approved PUD, SPI District or subdivision plat.

d. Where they do not exist, collector or arterial streets shall be constructed a minimum
of every one quarter mile (1,320 ft.) in urban contexts and every one half mile (2,640
ft.) in suburban contexts, unless the Director of Community Development makes a
determination that such streets are contrary to the desired development pattern of
the area or where an adopted street plan calls for a different street pattern.
e. Where block structure is required interior to unified development parcels, such as
within shopping centers and school campuses, streets may be private with no publicly
dedicated right-of-way, but the typical cross sections shall otherwise meet the
requirements of this section and the Engineering Standards Manual.
d. Alleys may be constructed interior to blocks but shall not be used to form the
perimeter of blocks.
e. Blocks shall provide for the continuation of and connection to existing streets except
where the Director of Community Development makes a determination that such
extension is contrary to the desired development pattern or where an adopted street
plan calls for a different street pattern.
f. Street stubouts shall be provided to adjacent undeveloped land except where
otherwise indicated in an adopted street plan.
g. Cul-de-sacs or other street terminations shall be prohibited except where physical
barriers such as limited access highways, railroads, canals or wetlands prevent
connectivity or where street connections cannot be made to existing development, as
determined by the Director of Community Development.

3.4.3 BUILDING TYPES
3.4.3.1 General
a. Building Types describe the types of principal buildings allowed. For purposes of
this section, a detached building is a freestanding building, regardless of the number
of units it contains, that is not attached to a building located on another lot. An
attached building is a building, regardless of the number of units it contains, that is
attached to another building located on another lot.
b. Mobile Homes, Personal Wireless Service Facilities and Utility and Essential Service
Facilities are not included and are regulated elsewhere.
(Ord. No. 5582, 05-16-16)
3.4.3.2 Special Building Types
a. The following special building types are allowed as indicated in the context tables
and where the principal use is permitted by right or as a conditional use by the
underlying zoning designation, except for within single-family zoning sub-districts as
outlined in Sub-Section 3.4.3.2.b. below. Lot and principal building requirements for
each special building type are specified in Tables 3.4-10 through 3.4-13.

b. Within single-family zoning sub-districts, the Cottage (CT) and Zero Lot Line (ZLL)
special building types shall only be established subject to the following procedures
and in accordance with the lot and principal building requirements specified in
Tables 3.4-10 and 3.4-13.
1. For proposed special building type lots not in designated historic districts,
the applicant shall submit to the Planning and Zoning Board a site
development plan showing the lot configuration, building placement and
Article 3: Urban Form Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 3.13
orientation, vehicle access and other appropriate site features, and
elevations or other architectural drawings showing the proposed exterior
treatment. The Board shall make determinations regarding 4. (a) through
(e) below.
2. For proposed special building type lots in designated historic districts, the
applicant shall submit to the Planning and Zoning Board a site development
plan showing the site layout with respect to the lot configuration, building
placement and orientation, vehicle access and other appropriate site
features. The Planning and Zoning Board shall make determinations
regarding 4.(a) through (d) below. If approved by the Planning and Zoning
Board, the applicant shall then apply to the Historic Preservation Board for a
Certificate of Review/Appropriateness. The Historic Preservation Board
shall make a determination regarding the design of the buildings as
specified in 4.(e) below.
3. The Planning and Zoning Board shall notify the owners of record of
properties within 250 feet of the subject property and shall conduct a public
hearing on the matter at a regular meeting.
4. In making its determination, the Board (or Boards) shall find that:
(a) The proposed lot configuration is compatible with the block and lot
configuration of the district and not hazardous or inconvenient to
surrounding residents or injurious to the long range development of
the district for residential purposes.
(b) The special building type does not result in excessive noise, traffic,
or parking congestion.
(c) There is adequate open space provided for both the special building
type and the adjacent properties.
(d) The special building type does not significantly impact the privacy,
light, air, or parking of adjacent properties.
(e) The design of the buildings shall be compatible with that of the
residential structures in the same general area or
neighborhood. Such a finding shall be based on a consideration of
the building mass, height, materials, window arrangement, yards,
Article 3: Urban Form Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 3.14
landscaping and any other pertinent considerations. If located in a
historic district, the Historic Preservation Board shall make this
determination with specific reference to the design guidelines for
the historic district in which the special building type is to be
located.
5. The Planning and Zoning Board may impose any conditions or limitations

Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.1
ARTICLE 4: GENERAL SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
4.1 INTENT AND APPLICABILITY
4.1.1 INTENT
It is the intent of this article to establish minimum standards for the layout and design of
development sites to ensure a quality urban form that is compatible with the context.
These standards are intended to supplement the development standards set forth in
Article 3.
4.1.2 GENERAL APPLICABILITY
a. Except as otherwise provided in this Code, no building, structure, or land located
within the city shall hereafter be developed except in conformity with the standards
and requirements of this article. Determinations regarding applicability shall be made
by the Director of Community Development.
b. Nonconforming Sites Lawfully Existing as of the Effective Date of this Code
1. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, existing development that does
not conform to the standards and requirements of this article shall conform in full
or, where site constraints exist, shall conform to the greatest practical extent
upon:
(a) Expansions of principal buildings which exceed 50 percent of the existing
square footage of the building, or buildings in the case of a multi-building
complex, or
(b) Building alterations if the aggregate cost exceeds 50 percent of the assessed
value of the structure or structures.
2. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, where an improvement or
alteration is proposed to a portion of an existing nonconforming development
site, the standards and requirements of this article shall apply only to that portion
of the site.
Example 1: If only a section of a nonconforming fence is replaced, only that
section of the fence must meet the standards and requirements for fences.
Example 2: If only a portion of a nonconforming parking lot is repaved, only that
portion must meet the standards and requirements for vehicle use areas.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.2
3. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, where an improvement or
alteration is proposed to an existing development site that eliminates constraints
or impediments that had prevented conformity with one or more of the standards
and requirements of this article, the standards and requirements thus enabled
shall henceforth conform to the greatest practical extent. (Example: If a new
conforming access point eliminates the need for a nonconforming access point,
the nonconforming access point shall be removed.)
c. Each section of this article contains further applicability provisions which are specific
to that set of standards and requirements.
d. If any provision of this article is found to be in conflict with the development
standards set forth in Article 3, the adopted Design Guidelines for a Historic District,
the conditions of an Special Public Interest District, the conditions of a Planned Unit
Development or the conditions of a Conditional Use, the more restrictive shall prevail.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14; Ord. No. 5714, 06-18-18)
4.2 ACCESS MANAGEMENT
4.2.1 INTENT AND APPLICABILITY
4.2.1.1 Intent
The intent of this section is to provide and manage access to properties while preserving
the operating efficiency of the roadway system, to improve the safety of motorists and
non-motorists, reduce traffic congestion and delay associated with poor access location
and design, to coordinate access management with the Florida Department of
Transportation (FDOT) and Polk County, and to support a multi-modal transportation
system. This section is also intended to help implement the access management
policies of the US Highway 98 South Corridor Access Management Plan.
4.2.1.2 Applicability
This section shall apply to all arterial and collector roadways within the city limits, and to
all properties that abut or have access to these roadways.
4.2.2 DEFINITIONS
Access Classification: A system for assigning the appropriate degree of access control to
roadways, based upon roadway function, traffic characteristics, and community
development objectives.
Access Management: The process of providing and managing access to land
development, while preserving the safety and efficiency of travel on the surrounding
roadway system.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.3
Arterial Roadways: Routes that provide service that is relatively continuous and of
relatively high traffic volume, long average trip length, high operating speed, and high
mobility importance. In addition, every United States numbered highway is an arterial
road. Arterial roadways are given the highest capacities since they are designed to carry
the greatest amount of through-traffic while generally providing a lower amount of
access to adjacent land uses.
Central City Transit Supportive Area (CCTSA): Area within which roadway levels-ofservice
are less stringent due to the presence of a traditional street grid network,
extensive bicycle and pedestrian networks and transit services and facilities.
Collector Roadways: Routes which provide service which is of moderately average
traffic volume, moderately average trip length, and moderately average operating
speed. Such a route also collects and distributes traffic between local roads or arterial
roads and serves as a linkage between land access and mobility needs.
Connection: A driveway, street, turnout, or other means of providing for the right of
vehicle access to or from transportation facilities. For the purpose of this section, two
one-way connections to a property may constitute a single connection.
Corner Clearance: The distance from an intersection of a public or private road to the
nearest connection along the public roadway. The distance is measured from the closest
edge of pavement of the intersecting road to the closest edge of the pavement of the
connection. The projected future edge of pavement of the intersecting road should be
used, where available. (See Figure 4.2-1)
Cross Access: An easement or service drive providing vehicular access between two or
more contiguous sites.
Directional Median Opening: An opening in a restrictive median that provides for
specific traffic movements and physically restricts other movements.
Edge of Pavement: The physical existing edge of a paved road or the future edge.
Future edge shall be used for the measurement where the associated capacity
improvements are within an adopted five year capital improvements program or within
the Polk Long Range Transportation Plan short term, financially feasible work program.
Full Median Opening: An opening in a restrictive median designed to allow all turning
movements to take place from the public road system and the adjacent connection, and
which therefore is intended for signalization.
Functional Area (of an intersection): That area beyond the physical intersection of two
roadways that comprises decision and maneuver distance, plus any required vehicle
storage length, and is protected through corner clearance standards and connection
spacing standards.
Functional Classification: A system used to group public roadways into classes according
to their purpose in moving vehicles and providing access.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.4
Joint Access (or Shared Access): A driveway connecting two or more contiguous sites to
the public street system.
Local Roads: Routes providing service that is of relatively low average traffic volume,
short average trip length or minimal through-traffic movements, and high land access
for abutting property. Local roads provide the greatest amount of access to adjacent
properties and have the lowest vehicle capacities.
Lot Frontage: The linear portion of property that directly abuts a roadway.
Minimum Connection Spacing: The minimum allowable distance between conforming
connections, measured from the closest edge of the pavement of the first connection to
the closest edge of the pavement of the second connection along the edge of the
traveled way.
Minimum Median Opening Spacing: The minimum allowable spacing between openings
in a restrictive median to allow for crossing the opposite traffic lanes to access property
or for crossing the median to travel in the opposite direction (U-turn). The minimum
spacing or distance is measured from centerline to centerline of the openings along the
traveled way.
Minimum Signal Spacing: The minimum spacing or distance between adjacent traffic
signals on a public roadway measured from centerline to centerline of the signalized
intersections along the traveled way.
Multi-Modal Transportation Level of Service: Refers to minimum level of service
standards for roadways outlined in the Comprehensive Plan, in the Transportation
Element, whereby the standards will vary based upon transit service frequency, bicycle
amenities and pedestrian facilities.
M-3 Level of Service District: The geographic area, adopted in the Comprehensive Plan,
which provides a multi-modal level of service standard for transportation facilities. The
M-3 District is where the local bicycle-accommodated bus system provides service at
least every 30 minutes and where there is a substantial sidewalk system present within
¼ mile of those 30 minute routes.
Non-Restrictive Median: A median or painted centerline that does not provide a
physical barrier between center traffic turning lanes or traffic lanes traveling in opposite
directions. This includes highways with continuous center turn lanes and undivided
highways.
Outparcel: A lot identified on a site plan or subdivision plan that is owned by a party
other than the primary owner of the parent property, and is intended to be developed
separately from the parent property and/or is intended to be developed for a different
use (e.g. a non-residential use vs. residential use).
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.5
Peak Hour: The highest hour of vehicular traffic volume on the adjacent public street
network as measured for the citys level of service standards for transportation. In some
instances, the peak hour of the development is evaluated for access management
purposes when the project could create an operational or safety problem on the public
road network during an off-peak time for adjacent street traffic.
Reasonable Access: The minimum number of connections, direct or indirect, necessary
to provide safe ingress and egress to the public road system based on the access
management classification (if any), the proposed connection(s) and projected roadway
traffic volumes, posted speeds, and the type and intensity of the land use.
Restrictive Median: The portion of a divided highway physically separating vehicular
traffic traveling opposite directions. Restrictive medians include physical barriers that
restrict movement of traffic across the median such as a concrete barrier, a raised
concrete curb and /or island, and a grass or a swaled median.
Service Road: A public or private street or road, auxiliary to a controlled access facility,
which has as its purpose the maintenance of local road continuity and provision of
access to parcels adjacent to the controlled access facility.
Stub-Out (Stub Street): A portion of a street or cross access drive used as an extension
to an abutting property that may be developed in the future.
Throat Length: The distance parallel to the centerline of a driveway to the first on-site
location at which a driver can make a right turn or a left turn. On roadways with curb
and gutter, the throat length shall be measured from the face of the curb to the end of
the physical barrier. On roadways without a curb and gutter, the throat length shall be
measured from the edge of the paved shoulder to the end of the physical barrier.
Transit Oriented Corridors (TOC): See definition in Article 1.

4.2.3.2 Connections at Intersections
a. General
1. New connections shall not be permitted within the functional area of an
intersection, as illustrated in Figure 4.2-2, unless:
(a) No other reasonable access to the property is available, and
(b) The connection does not create a potential safety or operational problem
as determined by the Director of Public Works, and
(c) A condition is included in the permit that the applicant shall agree to
close the access if and when alternative access becomes available that is
more consistent with the corner clearance standards for the abutting
roadways.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.8
2. Where no other alternatives exist, construction of an access connection may
be allowed along the property line farthest from the functional area of the
roadway intersection as a non-conforming access. Property access will be
restricted to the roadway with the lower functional classification and shall be
closed within six months of when any conforming access becomes available.
b. Limited Access Interchange Areas
1. Connections and median openings on arterial and collector roadways located
up to 1,320 feet (1/4 mile) from an interchange area or up to the first
intersection, whichever distance is less, shall be regulated to protect the
safety and operational efficiency of the limited access facility and the
interchange area. (See Figure 4.2-3)
Figure 4.2-2 Functional and Physical Area of the Intersection
Figure 4.2-3 Interchange Area Connections
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.9

ramp shall be at least 660 feet (1/8 mile). (See Figure 4.2-3)
3. The city may require the use of service roads for direct access to property
within the area abutting freeway interchanges. These roads shall be designed
to connect to more than one other roadway, wherever feasible, to enhance
the overall accessibility of interchange development to the surrounding area.
4. The minimum distance to the first full median opening shall meet FDOT
connection spacing standards.
4.2.3.3 Connection to Lower Classification Roadway
a. Where property is served by roads of different functional classifications, the City may
require development to provide primary access on the road with the lower functional
classification in order to minimize access and traffic congestion on the primary
roadway.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
b. Access to through lots shall be required on the street with the lower functional
classification. (See Figure 4.2-4) Access onto the higher functional classification
roadway may be approved by the Director of Public Works.
4.2.3.4 Service Roads
a. Service roads and/or shared access roads may be required on roadways operating
below acceptable level-of-service standards to help mitigate the adverse impact of
access on roadway safety and efficiency for concurrency purposes.
Figure 4.2-4 Double Frontage Lot Access
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.10
b. Parcels that abut service roads must provide a primary connection to the service road.
Secondary driveways to the public road system shall be prohibited. In instances
where a connection cannot be made to a service road (for example, the planned
service road has not yet been constructed to the subject property), a temporary
connection to the public road system may be granted by the proper permitting
authority (City, County or State). This temporary connection must be removed within
six months from the time that a service road is constructed to or adjacent to the
subject property.
c. Service roads shall not access any roadway within the functional area of an existing
intersection and shall not create a new access point that violates the connection
spacing criteria in this section.
d. All service roads shall be constructed to public street standards.
4.2.3.5 Cross Access and Joint Access
a. If the connection spacing standards of this section cannot be achieved, then joint use
connections and/or cross access easements shall be required.
b. Applicants for all non-residential developments may be required to use cross access
easements and joint use connections to connect adjacent properties in order to
reduce curb cuts, to increase the area for parking and landscaping, and to preserve
the capacity and safety of the roadway system.
c. Property owners utilizing joint and/or cross access shall record with the Polk County
Clerk of Court:
1. An easement allowing cross access to and from the adjacent properties;
2. A joint maintenance agreement defining maintenance responsibility of
property owners that share the joint use connection and cross access system.
d. Property owners that provide for joint and cross access may be granted a temporary
connection permit, where necessary, to provide reasonable access until such time as
the joint use connection and cross access connections are provided with adjacent
properties.
e. Within six months after construction of a joint use or cross access connection,
property owners utilizing such access shall close and remove any existing temporary
connections provided for access in the interim.
f. Development may be required to construct a paved stub-out to the property line in
anticipation of a future cross access connection. (See Figure 4.2-5)
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.11
g. The design of the cross access corridor or joint connection including driveway apron
shall conform to the Engineering Standards. The design shall ensure efficient and safe
vehicular operation and pedestrian movements for internal traffic circulation and for
traffic mobility on the adjacent roadway.
h. Cross access easements are not intended to be publicly maintained.
i. Properties that provide for joint use driveways under this section shall be eligible for a
reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces of up to 15 percent,
subject to review and approval of the Director of Community Development.
4.2.3.6 Unified Access
a. In the interest of promoting unified access and circulation systems, development sites
under the same ownership or consolidated for the purposes of development and
comprised of more than one building site shall be considered unified parcels for
purposes of this section. This shall also apply to phased development plans and
master developments such as Planned Unit Developments that contain a mix of land
uses. Accordingly, the following requirements shall apply:
1. The number of connections permitted shall be the minimum number
necessary to provide reasonable access to the overall site and not the
maximum available for that frontage.
2. All easements and agreements required under Sub-Section 4.2.3.5 shall be
provided.
3. Access to outparcels shall be internalized using the shared circulation system.
(See Figure 4.2-6) Internal connections (vehicular and non-vehicular) shall be
Figure 4.2-5 Cross Access Stub-Outs
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.12
made between different land uses within a master or planned development.
The shared internal circulation system shall be designed to avoid excessive
movement across parking aisles or queuing across surrounding parking and
driving aisles and shall encourage pedestrian and bicyclist safety.
b. Where abutting properties are in different ownership and not part of an overall
development plan, cooperation among the various owners in development of a
unified access and circulation system is encouraged; this includes pedestrian
connections. Such coordinated access may qualify for impact fee credits where it in
effect creates a reliever road system and provides at least two points of connection to
the public road network. Only the building sites under consideration for development
approval shall be subject to the requirements of this section. Abutting properties shall
not be required to provide unified access and circulation until they are developed or
are redeveloped.
c. Access to an outparcel shall be appropriately designed and marked with pavement
markings, signage, and similar appropriate guidance to maximize the efficiency of the
internal traffic circulation.
d. An adequately demarcated pedestrian pathway shall provide a safe route for
pedestrians between the outparcel and the primary development.
Figure 4.2-6 Internalized Access to Out-Parcels
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.13
e. Outparcels for land uses with connection volumes exceeding 100 peak hour trips may
be considered for a single right-in access point. This access shall not be within the
functional area of an existing intersection. The Director of Public Works shall
determine whether or not the proposed right-in access point is appropriate, based
upon the roadway characteristics, relevant traffic data, and the existing and proposed
land uses.
4.2.4 CORRIDOR MANAGEMENT FOR TYPE I ROADWAYS
4.2.4.1 General
a. The Comprehensive Plan identifies Type I roadways that are of particular
significance for freight movement and high capacity connectivity to Lakelands urban
core. Type I roadways include: US 98, County Line Road, SR 548 (George Jenkins
Boulevard from Sloan to US 98), SR 563 (Harden Boulevard from Ariana to SR 570/Polk
Parkway), State Road 33 (north of Granada Street), West Pipkin Road (west of Old
Highway 37 to County Line Road) and SR 546 (Memorial Boulevard between US
92/Wabash Avenue and Interstate 4).
b. To minimize local traffic and improve corridor efficiency and safety, access to
development sites on Type I roadways shall be controlled and cross-access and/or
service roads to adjacent properties and improvements to adjacent corridors shall be
required.
c. Access from development sites to County Line Road shall be restricted to the
minimum amount necessary to provide safe ingress/egress. Driveway connections
shall be coordinated with Polk County as the permitting agency.
4.2.5 CONNECTION DESIGN STANDARDS
4.2.5.1 General
a. Connections shall not be designed to require vehicles to back out directly onto the
abutting roadway except for driveways serving single family detached or two-family
dwellings on individual lots.
b. Where the roadway is undivided or where there is no signal control, and when
existing or projected connection volumes exceed 75 vehicles in the peak hour or 500
vehicles per day, a 3-lane connection typical section may be required. (See Figure 4.2-
7)
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.14
c. Where there is no traffic signal, raised traffic separators may be required when
connection volumes exceed 200 vehicles in the peak hour or 1,000 vehicles per day.
Channelization islands shall conform to appropriate City, County or State design
standards and shall be reviewed by the Director of Public Works. (See Figure 4.2-8)
Small pork chop raised islands are not an appropriate design alternative.
4.2.5.2 Throat Length
a. The minimum throat length for unsignalized driveway connections to arterial and
collector roadways shall, at a minimum, meet the following standards shown in Table
4.2-3 and Figure 4.2-9. However, deviations may be allowed by the Director of Public
Works for all constrained development sites on a Transit Oriented Corridor or within
the Central City Transit Supportive Area.

e. Continuous right turn lanes shall be prohibited.
f. Turn lane warrant requirements may be modified for a development based on factors
including but not limited to higher peak period traffic volumes, higher operating
speeds, localized roadway congestion, pedestrian volume, crash experience
(especially rear-end crashes) and facilities that have a larger number of heavy trucks
or similar vehicles. Modifications to requirements shall be supported by traffic
operations data and approved by the Director of Public Works.
4.2.6 INTERNAL SITE CIRCULATION
a. For non-residential developments that are projected to generate 300 or more total
peak hour trips and that are located along a roadway that has public transit service,
the following internal traffic circulation features shall be included in the development
plans. These features are in addition to other site plan requirements in the Land
Development Regulations.
Figure 4.2-11 Right Turn Storage and Taper Lanes
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.18
1. Internal service roads to serve as internal collectors and which can accommodate
transit vehicles shall be defined through the use of pavement markings/striping
and if possible via physical delineation techniques such as curbing of landscaped
areas in the parking lot. (See Figure 4.2-10)
2. Coordination with the local transit system and Director of Public Works or
their designee(s) regarding the feasibility of a transit circulation route that
allows for a transit stop within the site and near or along the front of the
principal building(s).
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
3. Separation of heavy trucks routed to the side or rear of the principal
building(s) including use of appropriate directional signage, as necessary.
b. Non-residential developments that are adjacent to a public sidewalk and projected to
generate less than 300 peak hour trips shall provide an adequately marked pedestrian
pathway between the building entrance and the adjacent sidewalk. For projects
located on corner parcels fronting more than one public street with a sidewalk, the
number of dedicated pedestrian pathways shall correspond to the number of project
driveways onto the public street system, with a maximum of one such connection per
frontage. Additional connections may be required for large retail and employment
center projects, including those within Developments of Regional Impact or Planned
Unit Developments. (See Figure 4.2-13) Marking for the pedestrian pathway may
include pavement striping, landscaping, bollards, or similar markings and appropriate
directional signage, as needed.
Figure 4.2-12 Service Road
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.19
c. Residential developments shall provide internal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-
compliant pedestrian connectivity within the development with special emphasis on
access to on-site recreational amenities, trails, clubhouses and open spaces.
d. The internal road networks for new or redevelopment plans shall include, at
minimum, a mainline internal roadway that maximizes on-site connectivity and shall
also include, wherever possible, a system of internal grid or modified grid connections
throughout the plan. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent all use of the
cul-de-sac but shall promote internal connections for vehicular traffic to the degree
such is reasonable and possible. Where cul-de-sacs or other street terminations are
used, sidewalk extensions or other such pathway connections to adjacent streets may
be required to maintain or enhance overall network connectivity.
e. Developments with drive-through facilities shall have adequate space to store the
projected peak demand of vehicles off the public rights-of-way and off public and
private streets. The minimum vehicle queue storage lengths for developments with
drive-through facilities that have direct access to arterial or collector roadways shall,
at a minimum, meet the standards set forth in Table 4.2-6.

4.2.7 DEVIATION FROM CONNECTION STANDARDS
a. Meeting the standards of this section may not always be possible. Therefore, the
following process is available to evaluate requested deviations from the standards of
this section. In all cases, however, safety for the driving public and pedestrians shall be
the primary consideration.
b. The Director of Public Works may make a determination to modify or waive the
requirements of Sub-Section 4.2.3.5 (Cross Access and Joint Access) where the
characteristics of abutting parcels would make adherence to the standards infeasible.
This determination shall be made in consultation with the Director of Community
Development.
c. Deviations of up to 10 percent of the connection standards in this section or
deviations of up to 100 feet, whichever is less, are considered Minor Deviations. The
Director of Public Works may grant such deviations based on roadway characteristics,
land use, traffic operations, and safety.
d. Except where otherwise provided for in this section for determination by the Director
of Public Works, other requests for deviations are considered Major Deviations and
shall be considered by the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals (ZBAA) in
accordance with the standards for variances contained in Article 12.
e. In addition to the general requirements for a variance contained in Article 12, the
applicant for a variance (major deviation) from the terms of this section shall provide
adequate data and analysis to the Director of Public Works to demonstrate how the
proposed alternate access management and/or site circulation plan is equal to or
better than the relevant required access management and internal circulation
provisions of this section. A staff report and recommendation from the Director of
Public Works, prepared in consultation with the Director of Community Development,
shall accompany the major deviation request to the ZBAA. Applicants for major
deviations from access spacing standards shall submit an access management plan to
the Director of Public Works as follows:
1. Encompasses a study area that includes the length of the property frontage
on all abutting roadways, plus the distance established by access spacing
standards on either side of the property lines, and the corresponding area on
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.21
the opposite side of undivided roadways or divided roadways where a median
opening is present.
2. Addresses existing and future access for study area properties.
3. Evaluates impacts of the proposed plan versus impacts of adherence to
adopted standards.
4. Includes all improvements and recommendations necessary to implement the
proposed plan.
4.3 ACCESSORY STRUCTURES
4.3.1 GENERAL
a. Certain accessory structures are permitted in addition to principal structures in
accordance with all standards of the context sub-district in which they are located and
the procedures and standards of this section.
b. Accessory structures shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to the principal
structure and located in a district that allows the principal use.
c. No accessory structure shall be constructed prior to the construction of a principal
structure.

4.5 LANDSCAPING, TREES AND BUFFERING
4.5.1 INTENT AND APPLICABILITY
4.5.1.1 INTENT
It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to
improve the quality and appearance of the built environment by preserving natural
vegetation and trees where possible and by incorporating new landscaping and trees into
development; to establish minimum standards for landscaped areas; to establish and
maintain street trees within rights-of-way; to establish minimum standards for buffer
screens between incompatible land uses; to establish minimum standards for water
efficient irrigation systems; to prevent excessive surface water runoff and maintain
permeable land areas; to encourage the use of native plants and discourage the use of
exotic or nuisance plants in landscape design.
It is further the intent of this article to prevent the destruction of existing tree canopy
where possible and to mitigate for the loss of tree canopy when its destruction cannot be
avoided. Trees are a valuable public resource. A healthy tree canopy prevents soil
erosion; provides windbreaks; beautifies the urban environment; increases the value of
land; reduces noise, dust, and glare; controls air pollution through the production of
oxygen and the reduction of carbon dioxide; provides wildlife habitat and moderates
extreme temperatures.
4.5.1.2 APPLICABILITY
Except as otherwise provided herein, the requirements of this article shall apply as
follows:
a. Upon the construction of any principal structure, the entire site shall conform to the
requirements of this article, except as follows:
1. In the case of single-family and two-family structures, only the minimum tree
density requirements of Sub-Section 4.5.4.2 shall apply.
2. In the case of phased development, the requirements of this article shall apply to
phases in accordance with the approved landscape plan.
3. In the case of multiple structure complexes, the requirements of this article shall
apply only to that portion of the site containing the new structure unless Sub-
Section 4.5.1.2.b or c applies.
b. When any principal non-residential structure or complex of structures is enlarged by
50 percent or more in gross floor area, the entire site shall conform to the
requirements of this article.
c. When alterations to any principal non-residential or multi-family structure or complex
of structures exceed 50 percent of the assessed value, the entire site shall conform to
the requirements of this article.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.34
d. When any vehicle use area is constructed or established or when any existing vehicle
use area is enlarged by 50 percent or more in area, the entire vehicle use area shall
conform to the requirements of Sub-Section 4.5.7. When any existing vehicle use
area is enlarged by less than 50 percent in area, the requirements of Sub-Section 4.5.7
shall apply only to the enlarged area unless Sub-Section 4.5.1.2.b or c. applies.
e. Proposed subdivisions requiring landscaping within rights-of-way and/or common
areas in accordance with Article 9 Subdivision Regulations.
f. The requirements of this article shall not apply to those portions of an airport or
heliport determined by the Federal Aviation Administration or the Florida Department
of Transportation to be required for the ground or aerial maneuvering of aircraft, or
land owned or operated by a public aviation authority in connection with the
development, operation or maintenance of airports and aviation areas or facilities
used for runways, taxiways, aprons, runway protection zones and approaches, air
traffic control towers, and aircraft navigational aids.
4.5.2 ADMINISTRATIVE MODIFICATIONS
The Director of Parks and Recreation shall be authorized to modify the requirements of
this article pertaining to street trees and to the preservation of regulated trees as
provided herein. At the recommendation of the Director of Parks and Recreation, the
Director of Community Development may modify other requirements of this article
under the following circumstances. Such modifications shall be noted on the applicable
permit or site plan. Applicants are not entitled to such modifications which are at the
discretion of the Director of Community Development or Director of Parks and
Recreation.
4.5.2.1 Modification for Physical Limitations
If the Director of Community Development determines that it is impossible or impractical
to meet the requirements of this article due to physical limitations imposed by the
location and arrangement of existing buildings, existing site dimensions or other existing
physical constraints, he may allow part or all of the required landscaping to be provided
elsewhere on the same site, or waive part of such requirements altogether, provided that
the requirements are implemented to the fullest extent possible given the physical
limitations.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.35
4.5.2.2 Modification for Solar Access
If the Director of Community Development determines that required trees or landscaping
will materially impede the functioning of any solar energy system or solar power
generating facility, he may allow part or all of the required landscaping to be provided
elsewhere on the same site, or modify the landscape requirements, provided that the
modification is the minimum necessary to allow the solar energy system or solar power
generating facility to operate properly.

flourishing and shall be protected during construction in accordance with Sub-Section
4.5.10.5. Trees damaged during construction shall not receive credit.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.54
4.5.10.3 Preservation of Regulated Trees
a. Tree Removal Permit Required
1. Except as otherwise provided herein, no regulated tree may be removed,
relocated or destroyed without a tree removal permit as provided in this section.
2. For development activity requiring a landscape plan or site alteration plan, the
approval of the landscape plan or site alteration plan shall constitute the tree
removal permit.
3. Any regulated tree that is proposed to be removed, relocated or destroyed for
any other reason shall require a separate tree removal permit using such form
and submittals as the Director of Parks and Recreation may require.
b. Identification on Landscape Plan or Site Alteration Plan
1. The location, size and species of all regulated trees shall be indicated on the
landscape plan or site alteration plan and shall indicate whether each is proposed
to be preserved, relocated or destroyed. As an alternative, regulated trees
proposed to be destroyed may be documented on a separate tree survey or
existing conditions plan. A table shall be included summarizing the total number
of trees by species and the total caliper inches of trees to be preserved, relocated
or destroyed. The applicant shall consider the following as a means to preserve
regulated trees and incorporate them into the site design:
(a) The location of proposed buildings;
(b) The location and design of proposed roads and vehicle use areas;
(c) The location and design of proposed drainage systems and stormwater
retention ponds;
(d) The use of tree wells, tree guards, root protection devices, hardening of
utilities or other methods of protecting trees on developed sites.
2. The landscape plan or site alteration plan shall indicate proposed grade changes
which may adversely impact or endanger regulated trees to be preserved. Spot
elevations may be required prior to the issuance of a tree removal permit.
c. Review by Director of Parks and Recreation
1. The Director of Parks and Recreation shall review the landscape plan, site
alteration plan or tree removal permit, which review shall include a field visit to
the site, and shall either approve or deny the plan as to each regulated tree
proposed to be preserved, relocated or destroyed.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.55
2. Approval Criteria
The Director of Parks and Recreation shall approve the plan or permit upon a
finding that the regulated trees will be preserved, or that adequate measures are
in place to assure the viability of regulated trees proposed to be relocated, or that
compensation has or will be provided for regulated trees proposed to be
destroyed.
d. Compensation Required
When the Director of Parks and Recreation approves a plan authorizing the
destruction of regulated trees, such trees shall be subject to compensation in
accordance with the following. Trees located within the footprint of any building
shown on an approved site plan shall not be subject to compensation. Replacement
trees shall be planted in accordance with Sub-Section 4.5.11. Trees planted in
fulfillment of other requirements of this article, such as required trees in vehicle use
areas or required buffers, shall count toward the number of trees required as
compensation for destroyed regulated trees. Compensation shall not be required for
regulated trees that the Director of Parks and Recreation determines pose a safety
hazard, have been weakened by disease, age, storm, fire or other injury or are near
the end of their lifespan and likely to become a hazard; are of negligible public value
including exotic, invasive, ornamental or fruit-bearing species; are likely to cause
damage to buildings, utilities or other planned infrastructure; or are overcrowded and
selective thinning is appropriate.
(Ord. No. 5522, 07-20-15)
1. Option 1: Tree Replacement on Same Lot or Parcel
Each destroyed regulated tree subject to compensation shall be replaced
elsewhere on the same lot or parcel as follows:
Destroyed Tree Replacement Trees
6  23 DBH Two new trees of the same class size (A or B)
24+ DBH New trees totaling the number of caliper inches destroyed
2. Option 2: Off-Site Mitigation
If the Director of Parks and Recreation determines that it is impractical to locate
the replacement trees on the same lot or parcel, he may authorize the
replacement trees to be planted at one or more off-site locations within the
corporate limits of the City of Lakeland.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.56
3. Option 3: Payment of Fee-in-Lieu
If he determines that other options are not feasible, the Director of Parks and
Recreation may authorize the payment of a fee-in-lieu for the value of regulated
trees that are destroyed. The fee schedule shall be as established by resolution of
the City Commission. If a fee-in-lieu is approved, the fee shall be paid into the
Tree Trust Fund prior to the issuance of any permit authorizing construction or
site alteration.
4.5.10.4 Preservation of Street Trees
a. No person shall destroy, remove, mutilate or abuse any street tree except as provided
herein.
b. Visibility of signage other than signs within rights-of-way shall not be grounds for the
destruction, removal or trimming of street trees.
c. The maintenance of all street trees shall be the responsibility of the city, except where
trees within rights-of-way are maintained by a homeowners association or other
entity in accordance with a duly recorded agreement. Authorized city personnel and
authorized contractors working for the city may trim or remove street trees as needed
to maintain the health of street trees; to allow free passage of pedestrians and
vehicles; to prevent the obstruction of or interference with utilities, street lights,
traffic lights, street signs and traffic control devices; or to prevent obstruction of the
view of vehicle operators at any street intersection.
d. Nothing in this section shall prevent the cutting or removal of any street tree that in
the opinion of the Director of Parks and Recreation is required for public safety.
e. Authorization Required to Work on Street Trees
1. Except where trees within rights-of-way are maintained by a homeowners
association or other entity in accordance with an agreement with the city, all work
on street trees shall be done only with the authorization of the Director of Parks
and Recreation. The Director of Parks and Recreation may authorize utility
companies, including contractors working for utility companies, and tree service
contractors to perform the following types of work on or near street trees: tree
removal, trimming or pruning, grading or trenching near street trees, installation
of pavement over street tree root zones, transport of buildings or other large
items that could damage street trees. All underground work performed in the
city-maintained right-of-way shall also require a right-of-way permit issued by the
Public Works Department. In the event of an emergency such as a storm, such
work may be performed without prior authorization, provided that
documentation of the work performed is provided afterward to the Director of
Parks and Recreation.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.57
2. In granting such authorization, the Director of Parks and Recreation shall find that
there is a need for the proposed work; that those who are to perform the work
are qualified to do so and are insured, bonded or pre-registered with the city; and
that any potential detriment to the citys street tree population entailed by the
proposed work is justified in the individual case. In making this determination,
the Director of Parks and Recreation shall consider factors such as the probability
that the proposed work will destroy or seriously injure the tree, the tree's health,
whether the tree's condition and size threaten serious damage to property, the
condition and number of other city street trees in the vicinity and other related
criteria.
3. The Director of Parks and Recreation may place conditions on any such
authorization that he deems necessary.
4. Where tree roots damage sidewalks, curbs, underground pipelines or similar
public facilities, every effort shall be made to correct the problem without
removing or damaging the tree. The Director of Parks and Recreation shall
determine corrective measures in consultation with the Public Works
Department. If repairs will result in extensive root damage, the Director of Parks
and Recreation may direct the department to remove the tree prior to facility
repairs.
5. All pruning shall be done in accordance with ANSI A300 (Part 1) Pruning. Any
proposed deviation from this standard must be approved by the Director of Parks
and Recreation in advance.
6. All trenching and tunneling shall be done in accordance with Trenching &
Tunneling Near Trees: A Field Pocket Guide for Qualified Utility Workers, by Dr.
James R. Fazio, 1998, The National Arbor Day Foundation. Any proposed
deviation from this standard must be approved by the Director of Parks and
Recreation in advance.
7. The Director of Parks and Recreation may inspect such work and shall have the
authority to stop any work if the standards of this article are not being followed.
8. In the event that development activity will destroy or require the relocation of
street trees or other public landscaping, the developer shall relocate such trees
and landscaping or shall replace such trees in accordance with Table 4.5-5 in a
location approved by the Director of Parks and Recreation. Such proposed
replacement or relocation shall be approved in advance by the Director of Parks
and Recreation and shall be shown on site plans or construction plans submitted
for review and approval. Such work shall be performed only by those authorized
by the Director of Parks and Recreation and shall include any required irrigation
systems. Repairs for any damage caused to utilities during such relocation shall
be at the expense of the developer.

4.5.10.5 Protection of Trees During Development Activity
Trees identified for preservation on the approved landscape plan, whether individually or
within a generalized area of natural vegetation, shall be protected during development
activity as follows.
a. Protected trees or groups of trees shall be clearly marked by flagging, painting or
other means.
b. All protected trees shall have the trunk and roots protected by protective barriers
erected prior to development activity in accordance with the following.
1. Protective barriers constructed of wood rails, pipe, chain link fabric or orange
plastic safety netting shall be placed around the tree or trees to form a continuous
barricade at least four feet high. Ideally such barriers will form a protection zone
described by the drip line. The Director of Parks and Recreation may allow a
smaller protection zone or alternative tree protection measures where space is
constrained. The barriers shall be shown on the site alteration plan and/or
landscaping plan.
2. Signs or other markings shall be placed on all sides of the protective barrier to
designate the protected area.
3. Protective barriers shall remain in place until landscape operations begin or until
construction in the immediate area has been completed.
4. Existing street trees located within rights-of-way interior to or adjacent to the
development shall have protective barriers before site work begins.
5. Trenching for underground utilities shall be prohibited inside the protective
barriers. If underground utilities must be routed through the protected area,
tunneling shall be required. All landscape preparation in these areas shall be
conducted by hand, except for mechanical tunneling as needed.
6. No vehicles, equipment, materials or fill shall be placed or stored within the
protected area.

4.5.11 STANDARDS FOR LANDSCAPE DESIGN, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE
4.5.11.1 Required landscaping and irrigation shall be installed and maintained in accordance with
the following standards. Approved landscape and irrigation plans shall provide the basis
on which compliance is determined.
4.5.11.2 Selection and Installation of Plant Material
a. Required plant material shall be selected from and planted in accordance with Tables
4.5-6, 4.5-7 and 4.5-8. Other species not listed may be approved by the Director of
Parks and Recreation.
b. A (Large) trees shall be used except when the use of B (Medium) or C (Small) trees is
specified or permitted herein. The Director of Parks and Recreation may authorize
the use of smaller tree sizes depending on specific site conditions. If so, tree size
substitution shall be made on the following basis: One A (Large) tree shall equal three
B (Medium) trees or six C (Small) trees. One B (Medium) tree shall equal three C
(Small) trees.
c. Newly planted trees shall be a minimum eight feet high and a minimum diameter of
one inch DBH or one and one-half inches six inches above grade at the time of
planting.
d. Upon the recommendation of the Director of Parks and Recreation, palms listed in
Table 4.5-7 may be used in place of required qualified trees on a case-by-case basis
such as where planting space is limited or where immediate vegetation height is
needed. The substitution ratio shall be as determined by the Director of Parks and
Recreation.

4.5.11.3 Irrigation Systems
a. Unless otherwise provided herein, all required landscaping shall be irrigated by a
permanent irrigation system designed for maximum water conservation which shall
provide 100 percent coverage of plant material, and shall be fully operational before
building occupancy, except that no irrigation system shall be required in those areas
where existing trees or areas of natural vegetation are to be preserved as indicated on
the approved landscape plan. If approved by the Director of Parks and Recreation,
newly planted trees may be irrigated by a temporary irrigation system. Newly planted
trees shall be irrigated until they are established, at which time irrigation may be
terminated and any temporary irrigation system removed.
b. Rain shut-off devices shall be required.
c. Irrigation systems serving landscape areas having different irrigation demand shall be
zoned accordingly.
d. Water Source
1. At the discretion of the Water Utilities Department, the use of non-potable water
sources may be required for irrigation. Non-potable sources include shallow
wells, agricultural wells, lakes, ponds, stormwater retention and detention
facilities, and reclaimed/reuse water systems. Where non-potable irrigation
water systems are planned but not yet operational, at the discretion of the Water
Utilities Department the irrigation system may be connected to the potable water
system and disconnected when non-potable irrigation water becomes available.
The use of non-potable irrigation water sources shall not exempt development
from the water-efficient landscaping principles of this article.
2. Irrigation systems shall not be connected to both potable and non-potable
sources due to the potential of contaminating the Citys potable water
system. Any water source other than the Citys potable water system is an
auxiliary supply. Where an auxiliary supply is used, there shall be a physical
disconnect (air gap) between the two piping systems. An approved backflow
prevention assembly shall be installed at the Citys water service connection to
any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply, even though there is no
connection between the auxiliary water supply and the public potable water
system. Backflow prevention assemblies approved by the Water Utilities
Department shall be installed on all potable water service connections/meters to
the site, including those for domestic, fire service and irrigation water.
4.5.11.4 Maintenance of Landscaping
a. Required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition at all times. No
required shrubs or trees shall be destroyed without a permit issued by the Director of
Parks and Recreation upon approval of a proposed landscape plan or subdivision
construction plan.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.79
b. Required trees shall not be abused. Required trees shall not be pruned or trimmed in
such a manner as to prevent the tree from reaching its mature height and canopy.
c. All areas that are to be preserved as natural vegetation shall be maintained to
eliminate invasive vegetation, lawn grasses, trash, or other debris and shall be
managed to maintain the plant community in its natural state.
d. Stormwater management facilities shall be maintained free of cattails or other
invasive or noxious growth in accordance with City of Lakeland and SWFWMD
requirements and permits.
e. Landscaping within visibility triangles shall be maintained in accordance with 4.12.
f. Mulch shall be replenished as necessary to maintain a three inch depth.
g. This section shall not apply to tree clearance activity or emergency repair work
authorized by a public utility within a right-of-way or utility easement.
4.5.12 LANDSCAPE AND IRRIGATION PLANS
4.5.12.1 Landscaping and Irrigation Plans Required
a. A landscape plan and an irrigation plan, prepared in accordance with this article and
the most recent administrative procedures, shall be submitted with applications for
building permits, site plans, preliminary subdivision plats and occupancy permits for
all projects to which this article applies (See Sub-Section 4.5.1.2 Applicability.)
Additional landscaping, landscape plans and irrigation plans shall not be required for
premises with conforming landscaping. Landscape and irrigation plans for nonresidential
and multi-family projects of five acres or greater shall be signed and sealed
by a Registered Landscape Architect licensed in the State of Florida.
(Ord. No. 5522, 07-20-15)
b. A separate landscape plan and an irrigation plan is optional in the case of single-family
or two-family structures. In lieu of a separate landscape plan, the location of all trees
necessary to meet minimum tree density and all trees to be preserved and protected
during construction shall be shown on the construction plans as part of the
application for a building permit. Where irrigation is provided, rain shut-off devices
and back flow preventers are required and non-potable water sources may be
required.
4.5.12.2 Landscaping Plan Requirements
Landscaping plans shall contain the following minimum information:
a. Name, address, and telephone number of both the owner and the designer.
b. Scale (minimum 1" = 40'), north arrow, and date.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.80
c. Location, common name and DBH of all regulated trees. Indicate whether each is to
be preserved, relocated or destroyed. The new location of all relocated trees. The
proposed location of replacement trees. As an alternative, regulated trees proposed
to be destroyed may be documented on a separate tree survey or existing conditions
plan. This requirement may be waived by the Director of Parks and Recreation if he
finds after a field visit that there are no significant trees in the site.
d. Areas of natural vegetation proposed to be preserved.
e. Location and dimensions of all planter strips, planter beds, landscape islands and plant
materials.
f. Vehicle use areas including parking spaces, driveways, drive aisles, loading areas and
other vehicle maneuvering areas.
g. Abutting rights-of-way, street names, centerlines, curb lines, curb cuts and median
openings.
h. Stormwater retention ponds, backflow prevention assemblies, transformers,
switchgear boxes and other on-site facilities.
i. Overhead and underground utilities.
j. Sight visibility triangles in accordance with Section 4.12.
4.5.12.3 Irrigation Plan Requirements
Irrigation plans shall contain the following minimum information. Such plans should be
separate from the landscape plan but should use the same format and scale.
a. Location of rotor and spray heads, drip system mainlines, valves and valve boxes,
controller, rain shut-off devices, and back flow preventer;
b. Location and identification of water source including, if applicable, location of well
and size of pump;
c. Location and size of pipes;
d. Location of sleeves, if any;
e. Design radius of rotor and spray heads; and
f. Flow rate and static water pressure at the point of connection.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.81
4.5.13 ENFORCEMENT
4.5.13.1 General
a. No building permit shall be issued unless the landscape and irrigation plans have been
approved.
b. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued unless all required landscaping has been
installed in accordance with the approved landscape and irrigation plans, unless a
cash bond in the amount of 200 percent of the cost of the required landscaping is
posted by the developer in lieu of complete installation. The amount of the bond shall
be determined by the Director of Parks and Recreation. The owner shall comply with
these landscaping requirements within 30 days from the date the bond is posted.
c. Failure to comply with the provisions of this article shall constitute grounds for the
issuance of a stop work order and/or the withholding or revocation of site plan
approval, building permits, certificates of occupancy or any other approvals necessary
to commence or continue development.
d. The property owner shall take immediate corrective action upon notice from the city
that any tree or landscaping is a threat to public safety or to property.

4.7.2 SIDEWALKS
4.7.2.1 Applicability
a. Principal Structure on Lot or Parcel
Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for any residential or nonresidential
principal structure, the developer or property owner shall construct
sidewalks along roadways adjacent to all front and street side lot lines where
sidewalks do not presently exist, except for any new single family or two-family
structure on any local street where a sidewalk presently exists directly on the opposite
side of the street. Such sidewalks shall not be required for the enlargement,
alteration or reconstruction of existing single family or two-family structures, provided
that a building permit for reconstruction is pulled within 12 months of the demolition
of the existing single family or two-family principal structure. In the case of new
principal structures in existing multi-building complexes, such sidewalks shall only be
required when the aggregate cost of the improvements exceeds 50 percent of the
total assessed value of all structures located on the same lot or parcel.
b. Enlarged, Altered or reconstructed Multi-Family or Non-Residential Principal Structure
on Lot or Parcel
Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for any enlarged, altered or
reconstructed multi-family or non-residential principal structure on a lot or parcel, the
developer or property owner shall construct sidewalks along roadways adjacent to all
front and street side lot lines where sidewalks do not presently exist when the
aggregate cost of the improvements exceeds 50 percent of the total assessed value of
all structures located on the same parcel.
c. Subdivisions (including Mobile Home Subdivisions).
1. Abutting Streets: Upon the construction of roadways for any new subdivision
or resubdivision, the developer shall construct sidewalks along the subdivision
side of each roadway abutting the subdivision where sidewalks do not
presently exist, except that in the case of abutting local streets, no sidewalk
shall be required where a sidewalk presently exists directly on the side
opposite the subdivision and, if no sidewalk presently exists on either side, the
required sidewalk may be constructed on the side opposite the subdivision if
it results in better pedestrian connectivity.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.88
2. Internal Streets: Upon the construction of roadways for any new subdivision
or resubdivision, the developer shall construct sidewalks along both sides of
arterial and collector roadways internal to the subdivision, and along at least
one side of local streets internal to the subdivision. As an alternative,
required sidewalks on internal local streets adjacent to building sites may be
constructed on a lot by lot basis prior to the issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy for a structure on each respective lot. If this alternative is used, the
developer shall construct sidewalks on arterial roadways, collector roadways,
and on local streets adjacent to common areas that are not building sites at
the time of roadway construction. If the developer elects to have sidewalks
on only one side of any internal local street, he shall indicate on the plat the
side of the street on which the sidewalk will be constructed. Such sidewalks
shall be continuous on one side of the street within the same block but may
cross to the other side on the next block. In the case of through lots, the
Director of Community Development shall determine which yards function as
rear yards and which functions as front yards and the developer shall
constructed sidewalks adjacent to any yards that function as rear yards at the
time of roadway construction. Sidewalks adjacent to through lot yards that
function as front yards may be constructed on a lot by lot basis as above.
d. Multi-family Developments
Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the first unit in any new multifamily
residential development, the developer or property owner shall construct
sidewalks along the development side of each roadway abutting the development
where sidewalks do not presently exist, except on any local street where a sidewalk
presently exists directly on the opposite side of the street, and along at least one side
of all internal roadways. Internal sidewalks shall connect all buildings, on-site
amenities and any existing or planned external sidewalks along the project frontage.
e. Mobile Home Parks
Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for any new mobile home park, the
developer or property owner shall construct sidewalks along the development side of
each roadway abutting the development where sidewalks do not presently exist,
except on any local street where a sidewalk presently exists directly on the opposite
side of the street, and along at least one side of all entrance roadways.
f. Shopping Centers
Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the first unit in any new
shopping center, the developer or property owner shall construct sidewalks along the
development side of each roadway abutting the shopping center where sidewalks do
not presently exist.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.89
g. Multi-Unit Industrial or Office Park Developments
Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the first unit in any new multiunit
industrial or office park development, the developer or property owner shall
construct sidewalks along the development side of each roadway abutting the
development where sidewalks do not presently exist, except on any local street where
a sidewalk presently exists directly on the opposite side of the street, and along at
least one side of the principal entrance roadway. Sidewalks shall be constructed
between the principal customer entrances of each building entrance within an office
park campus.
4.7.2.2 Exceptions
a. Payment in Lieu of Construction
1. Where Sidewalk Network Does Not Exist on Local Streets: In the case of infill
development or infill redevelopment on a local street where there is no existing
sidewalk to tie into on the same side of the street and no existing sidewalk
directly on the opposite side of the street, the developer or property owner
shall make a payment into the Sidewalk Construction Fund in lieu of
constructing sidewalks along local streets. Such payment shall be equivalent to
twenty percent of the per linear foot cost to the City for installing the sidewalk
based upon the current market price as determined by the City Engineer.
Payment shall be made prior to the issuance of a building permit for the
structure. This exception shall not apply in the case of lots in subdivisions where
the developer has chosen to construct sidewalks on a lot by lot basis in
accordance with Sub-Section 4.7.2.1.c.2.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
2. Where Sidewalk Not Feasible, Regardless of Street Classification: The City
Engineer shall be authorized to determine if the construction of sidewalks
required by this section is infeasible, impractical, unsafe or otherwise
undesirable in a particular case due to topographic conditions, right-of-way
restrictions that cannot be mitigated, the presence of existing physical
impediments including trees, impending roadway or utility construction, or
other circumstances that the City Engineer shall deem appropriate. In such
case, the developer or property owner shall make a payment into the City of
Lakeland Sidewalk Construction Fund in lieu of constructing the required
sidewalks. Such payment shall be equivalent to eighty five percent of the per
linear foot cost to the city for installing the sidewalk based upon the current
market price as determined by the City Engineer. Payment shall be made prior
to the issuance of any building permit for the development, or in the case of a
subdivision, prior to final plat approval.
b. Sidewalks shall not be required along roads that are specifically exempted as part of
an approved Alternative Pedestrian Circulation System Plan pursuant to Sub-Section
4.7.2.3.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.90
c. The Director of Community Development may grant relief from some or all of the
requirements of this section for qualified affordable housing developments including
single family, two-family and multi-family developments, in accordance with
administrative policies for affordable housing. In granting such relief, the Director
may propose a plan to fund the construction of sidewalks from other sources,
including but not limited to the City of Lakeland Sidewalk Construction Fund.
4.7.2.3 Alternative Pedestrian Circulation System Plan
To allow for flexibility and to encourage innovative design, the developer may submit an
alternative pedestrian circulation system plan as part of a Planned Unit Development,
conditional use or subdivision plat. The city may also initiate an alternative pedestrian
circulation system plan as part of an Special Public Interest District. Such plan may
incorporate paths, trails, overpasses, underpasses or other design features that provide
equal or greater pedestrian mobility to the requirements of this section. If the site design
elements of the plan are approved, relief may be granted from some or all of the
requirements of this section. Facilities that are part of an alternative pedestrian
circulation system that are not conventional sidewalks to be dedicated for public
maintenance shall be privately maintained. All components of an alternative pedestrian
network shall be located within a dedicated access easement approved by the Director of
Public Works.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
4.7.2.4 Sidewalk Construction Standards
All required sidewalks shall meet requirements of the City of Lakeland Engineering
Standards Manual regardless of whether they are located in a public right-of-way, private
right-of-way, or easement.
4.7.2.5 Donation of Right-of-Way or Easement
Sidewalks may be constructed within public road rights-of-way, private road rights-of-way,
or within suitable easements. Where sidewalks required by this section are to be publicly
maintained and sufficient public right-of-way does not exist to construct the sidewalks,
the property owner shall donate the right-of-way or shall provide easements to allow the
sidewalks to be constructed. The City Engineer shall determine the amount of right-ofway
or easement needed in each case. Where the donation of additional right-of-way
would cause unnecessary hardship with respect to minimum building setbacks, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment and Appeals may issue a variance. A private entity such as a
developer or property owners association may construct required sidewalks on private
property without donating land for public right-of-way, provided that the sidewalks are
privately maintained.
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.91
4.7.2.6 Protection of Street Trees
Where possible, sidewalks shall be routed to avoid existing street trees and root zones of
street trees. Sidewalk construction that will involve the removal of street trees or paving
over or grading within 30 percent or more of the root zone of street trees shall require
authorization of the City Arborist in accordance with Section 4.5 (Landscaping, Trees and
Buffering).
4.7.2.7 Construction Bond
Construction plans shall include sufficient detail for the construction of required
sidewalks. Except as noted herein, construction of sidewalks shall be completed prior to
the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, provided, however, that in instances where
completion of sidewalk construction is delayed due to circumstances beyond the
reasonable control of the developer or property owner, and all other requirements for a
Certificate of Occupancy have been met, the Building Official shall be authorized to issue
the Certificate of Occupancy upon receipt of a cash bond in the amount of 110 percent of
the cost of the sidewalk construction. Such bond shall be held for a period not to exceed
four weeks from date of receipt; after which if the sidewalk construction has not been
started by the developer or property owner, the bond shall be applied toward
construction of the sidewalk by the city.
4.7.2.8 Maintenance
Sidewalks within public rights of way shall be maintained by the City of Lakeland. The City
of Lakeland shall repair defects caused by normal deterioration in accordance with Public
Works Department policy, provided, however, that in the event any sidewalk is damaged
by the act or omission of the abutting property owner or one acting by, through or with
the permission of the abutting property owner, including lack of maintenance of
vegetation that causes damage or slippery conditions to the sidewalk, then the cost of
repairing any damage occasioned by the act or omission of the abutting property owner
or the act or omission of other person acting by, through or with the permission of the
abutting property owner shall be borne by such abutting property owner. If the abutting
property owner fails to cause such repairs to be made, the City of Lakeland shall repair or
restore the sidewalk and shall assess the cost of such repair or restoration against such
abutting property owner in the manner prescribed for the assessment of local
improvements.

of the Director of Public Works the developer may pay a fee in lieu of construction
into the Transportation Fund for Pathways Projects. The fee shall be based on a
signed and sealed cost estimate prepared by a registered professional engineer in
the State of Florida. If the pathway facility is not necessary to achieve a favorable
transportation concurrency determination, the development may provide a
payment to the Pathways Fund equivalent to the Sidewalk Construction Fund
payment otherwise allowed under Sub-Section 4.7.2.2.
b. Any subdivision or development proposing a multi-use pathway as part of an
Alternative Pedestrian Circulation System Plan shall do so in accordance with the
requirements of Sub-Section 4.7.3.2 for the appropriate pathway type.
c. Any development not located on a Priority Pathways Corridor which voluntarily
provides multi-use pathways or bike lanes, shall do so in accordance with the
requirements of Sub-Section 4.7.3.2 for the appropriate pathway type.

4.9 SIGNS
4.9.1 INTENT
It is the intent of the City Commission through the provisions of this article to create the
legal framework for comprehensive sign regulations. Furthermore, it is the intention of
this article to authorize the use of signs which are:
a. Compatible with the surroundings;
b. Appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain;
c. Expressive in the identity of individual proprietors or of the community as a
whole; and,
d. Legible in the circumstances in which they are seen.
The City Commission has determined that the public has a primary interest in controlling
the erection, location, and maintenance of on-premises and off-premises signs in a
manner designed to protect the public health and safety, to promote the public welfare,
including the preservation and improvement of the aesthetic beauty of the community
and to protect the free speech rights of its citizens. The number, size and location of such
signs may, if uncontrolled, detract from traffic safety by diverting the drivers attention
away from the driving task. The indiscriminate erection and maintenance of numerous
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.97
large signs seriously detract from the enjoyment and pleasure of the natural scenic beauty
of the city.
Therefore, the promotion and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare of the
people of the city requires that the erection, construction, location, maintenance, size,
and number of signs be regulated and controlled.

4.11.5 ADMINISTRATIVE MODIFICATIONS
4.11.5.1 General Procedures
a. The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility in modifying the minimum required
and the maximum allowed number of off-street parking spaces of Sub-Section
4.11.4.1 through a number of parking options which may be approved through an
administrative modification.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
b. An administrative modification to Sub-Section 4.11.4.1 that utilizes one or more of the
Parking Options listed below may be approved by the Director of Community
Development or his designee after consultation with the Public Works Department.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
c. Applications seeking to modify the required number of parking spaces shall be made
in writing to the Director of Community Development and shall:
1. Demonstrate that a particular use or situation, such as physical site constraints,
is unusual or unique to the extent that it poses practical difficulty in complying
with the required number of off-street spaces; and
2. Include technical justification in the form of an independent parking analysis or
alternative standards published by a recognized professional organization such
as the American Planning Association (APA), the Urban Land Institute (ULI)
and/or the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE).
4.11.5.2 Parking Options
a. Alternative Design
Parking quantities above the maximum allowed under Sub-Section 4.11.4.1 may be
considered for projects which document a demonstrated need and incorporate
alternative design techniques to minimize impervious surface areas within the
project. Such techniques may include but are not limited to the use of pervious
pavers for perimeter and/or overflow parking, the use of bioswales and the creation
of site amenities such as additional green space areas.
(Ord. No. 5455, 07-21-14)
b. Parking Offsets (Reductions)
1. Tree Protection Offset
The required number of off-street parking spaces may be reduced by up to 20
percent if that area which would normally be required for parking is used for
the protection of existing trees or for landscaping in addition to the minimum
required by Section 4.5 (Landscaping, Trees and Buffering).
(Ord. No. 5721, 06-18-18)
Article 4: General Site Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 4.146
2. Transit Offset
The required number of off-street parking spaces may be reduced up to a
maximum of 10 percent for non-residential or multi-family projects that are
located along a fixed transit route operated by either the Lakeland Area Mass
Transit District (LAMTD) or the Polk County Transit Authority. The route on
which the project is located must provide service at headways, or frequency,
of sixty minutes or less and must have a designated transit stop located within
1,320 feet (¼ mile) of a projects boundaries.
3. Cumulative Parking Offsets
In no case shall the reduction of required off-street parking spaces by offsets
be greater than 20 percent. This includes any credit against minimum offstreet
parking requirements that may be granted through the provision of
bicycle parking facilities in accordance with Sub- Section 4.11.6.

Adult (regulated) uses which have been lawfully established at their existing locations
prior to annexation into the city and which are not in conformance with the
requirements of this land development code shall be required to discontinue such
regulated use within one year from the effective date of annexation if the adult
(regulated) use continues to be in violation of the distance requirements of this
section; however, in no event shall the adult (regulated) use of such establishment be
allowed to continue beyond that date upon which it would have been required to
discontinue said adult (regulated) use had the property not been annexed into the
city.
When a non-conforming use of such establishment has been discontinued for 30 days
or more, its future use shall revert to the uses permitted in the district in which the
establishment is located.
d. Variance from Location Requirements
The Zoning Board of Adjustment and Appeals is authorized to grant a variance from
the location requirements of this section if it finds:
1. That the proposed regulated use will not be contrary to the public interest or
injurious to nearby properties and that the spirit and intent of the code will be
observed;

contrary to any programs of neighborhood conservation or urban revitalization;
and
3. That all appropriate regulations of this code will be observed.
4. That a sufficient physical barrier separates the adult (regulated) use for which a
variance is being sought from the land uses(s) which has caused the regulated
or adult use not to be in compliance with the distance or locational
requirements of this section so as to substantially fulfill the purpose of these
requirements. Such physical barriers include, but are not limited to, limited
access streets or highways, walls, and natural or manmade waterways.

industrial, office, or institutional structure, or any multi-family structure of three or
more stories. This shall include buildings, water tanks, private light poles, light poles
at publicly owned athletic facilities or other structures not originally designed as PWS
antenna mounts. PWS facilities shall not be mounted on single family structures, two
family structures or on multi-family structures less than three stories in height. The
facility shall include any associated equipment shelters regardless of where they are
located with respect to the mount.
c. Placement of a PWS facility on a legally non-conforming structure shall not be
considered an expansion of the non-conforming structure.
d. PWS facilities shall not project into a required setback more than the maximum
projection permitted in the zoning districts in which the facilities are located.
e. Structure-mounted PWS facilities shall be located and designed to be accessible to
authorized persons only.
5.18.4.2 Maximum Height
a. Structure-mounted PWS facilities may extend above the roofline or highest point of

limitations of the Polk County Airport Zoning Regulations.
5.18.4.3 Visual Compatibility
a. To the greatest practical extent, structure-mounted PWS facilities shall be placed on
the structure out of public view. When this is not practical, the use of enclosures or
screens made of fiberglass or other material pervious to radio signals is encouraged to
conceal the facility from public view in a manner that is compatible with the scale,
color, and architectural character of the structure.
b. When it is necessary to place the facility in public view, to the greatest practical
extent, it shall be integrated into the structure in a manner that is compatible with the
scale, color, and architectural character of the structure. When use of a pole or mast
antenna mount is necessary, the use of cross-polarized (dual-polarized) antennas or
similar designs that reduce the visual obtrusiveness of the facility is encouraged.
Article 5: Standards for Specific Uses
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 5.45
c. To the greatest practical extent, equipment shelters associated with structuremounted
PWS facilities shall be located inside the existing structure, or concealed
from public view, or made compatible with the scale, color, and architectural
character of the structure.
5.18.5 STANDARDS FOR GROUND-MOUNTED FACILITIES

conventional zoning district which most closely approximates the use or uses
permitted in the particular PUD district.
b. Ground-mounted facilities are free-standing facilities constructed upon the ground.
Utility pole-mounted facilities shall not be considered ground-mounted facilities. The
ground-mounted facility shall include any associated equipment shelters regardless of
where they are located with respect to the mount.
c. The use of existing structures as antenna mounts shall be preferred to the
construction of new ground-mounted facilities. An applicant for a new groundmounted
facility shall submit a report inventorying the availability of existing
structures, including utility poles, within the applicants search area which may serve
as alternatives to the proposed ground-mounted facility. The applicant must
demonstrate that the proposed facility cannot reasonably be accommodated on such
existing structures due to one or more of the following factors:
1. The structure provides insufficient height to allow the applicants facility to
function reasonably in parity with similar facilities.
2. The structure provides insufficient structural strength to support the applicants
antenna and related equipment.
3. The structure provides insufficient space to allow the applicants antenna to
function effectively and reasonably in parity with similar equipment.

6.2 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
6.2.1 INTENT
The purpose of this section is to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due
to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to:
a. Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during
times of flooding;
b. Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or
minimize future flood damage;
c. Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations,
storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase
flood damage or erosion potential;
d. Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to
minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the
floodplain;
e. Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;
f. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of
flood hazard areas;
g. Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects
and response to and recovery from flood events; and
h. Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community
participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.
(Ord. No. 5610, 12-20-16)
6.2.2 APPLICABILITY
The provisions of this section shall apply to all development that is wholly within or
partially within any flood hazard area as established in Sub-Section 6.2.2.3 including but
not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and
utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement,
replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are
exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of
manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks;
placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other
development.

6.2.2.3 Basis for Establishing Flood Hazard Areas
The Flood Insurance Study for Polk County, Florida and Incorporated Areas dated
December 22, 2016, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and
revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this section and shall serve
as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that
establish flood hazard areas are on file at the Lakeland Planning Division, 228 South
Massachusetts Ave, Lakeland, 33801.

6.2.2.4 Submission of Additional Data to Establish Flood Hazard Areas
To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to Sub-Section 6.2.5,
the Floodplain Administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field
surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital
topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations:
a. Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated
as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood
hazard area and subject to the requirements of this section and, as applicable, the
requirements of the Florida Building Code.
b. Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as
special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a Letter of Map Change that
removes the area from the special flood hazard area.

6.2.3 Disclaimer of liability
a. The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered the minimum
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside of mapped
special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be
free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations
contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and
the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be
revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to
revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied
or expressed by compliance with this section.
b. This section shall not create liability on the part of the City or by any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this section or
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

7.4 EFFECT OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ZONING
7.4.1 SITE PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL REQUIRED
After a parcel or group of parcels has been zoned as a PUD, all improvements not
subject to review and approval pursuant to the subdivision regulations of this code shall
be subject to site plan review. Except, however, site plan review shall not be required:
Article 7: Planned Unit Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 7.8
a. For the construction of single-family and two-family dwellings and related
improvements on lots designated by the Site Development and Standards Plan for
such purposes; or
b. For the construction of any improvements which are specified in the Site
Development and Standards Plan to a level of detail equal to or greater than is
required pursuant to the site plan review provisions of this code.
7.4.2 CHANGES TO SITE DEVELOPMENT AND STANDARDS PLANS, CONDITIONS AND
COVENANTS
Proposed changes to PUD Site Development and Standards Plans, conditions, covenants
and any other provision incorporated as part of the ordinance enacting PUD zoning for a
particular parcel or parcels, shall be reviewed by the Director of Community
Development to determine whether the change is a major or minor modification from
previously approved plans or conditions. Any modification of an approved PUD plan
which involves a change in land use shall be considered a major modification. Other
modifications may be declared major modifications if the Director of Community
Development determines they deviate substantially from an approved PUD plan.
Requests for major modifications shall follow the same procedure set forth herein for
PUD zoning.
Any proposed change to an approved PUD which does not constitute a major
modification shall be considered a minor modification. At the discretion of the Director
of Community Development, minor modifications may be referred to the Planning and
Zoning Board with a recommendation or, if the Director of Community Development
deems the proposed change to be de minimus, he may make the minor modification
administratively. Action by the Planning & Zoning Board or Director of Community
Development in such cases shall be final. Requests for minor modifications shall include
a revised PUD plan indicating the effect of the proposed changes and the reasons why
the changes are necessary.
7.4.3 REPEAL OR MODIFICATION OF PUD IF CONSTRUCTION NOT COMMENCED
Failure to commence construction within five years of the effective date of the adoption
of PUD zoning shall be grounds for the city, at its discretion, to initiate a rezoning of the
subject property. In such event, the Planning & Zoning Board may recommend to the
City Commission that the subject property be returned to its previous zoning
classification, that the PUD be modified, or that the PUD be retained in its current form.
7.5 PRECEDING PUD ORDINANCES INCORPORATED
Prior to the effective date of this article, numerous parcels of land were zoned Planned
Unit Development. It is the intent of this article that parcels which were so zoned, and
which are zoned Planned Unit Development pursuant to this article, shall be regulated
by the language contained in the particular ordinance which designated them as
planned unit developments. However, this intent does not apply to parcels which were
Article 7: Planned Unit Development Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 7.9
at one time zoned planned unit development, but which were specifically rezoned by
subsequent ordinances including those ordinances enacted prior to and after this
article. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein is intended to or shall be
interpreted as limiting the city's authority to initiate the rezoning of any parcel of land.

the time of the creation of an SPI District, or have the effect of modifying or
supplementing the requirements, regulations and standards of the existing base
districts or districts to the extent indicated in the SPI District amendment. Where an
SPI District entirely supplants and replaces an existing district, the boundaries of the
SPI District shall be mapped on the Official Zoning Atlas as the base district. Where an
SPI District modifies or supplements the requirements, regulations or standards of an
existing district, it shall be graphically depicted on the Official Zoning Atlas as a pattern
or layer on top of the base zoning district.

check, or irrevocable letter of credit satisfactory to the City Attorney. The city may use
the performance guarantee to recover the cost of correcting faulty workmanship,
damage caused by on-site or off-site construction, material failures, or other outstanding
construction issues.
The performance guarantee shall not be released nor shall it expire without the written
consent of the Director of Public Works and shall remain in effect until a maintenance
guarantee is provided and accepted by the city for all components covered under the
performance guarantee. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued nor shall any
beneficial occupancy of any buildings take place until the off-site improvements which
are required by the city for the specific phase being constructed are complete and a
maintenance guarantee has been accepted.
The performance guarantee shall include language giving the city the right to complete
the project or to assign the project to others for disposition or completion in the event of
default on the guarantee by the developer. In accepting such guarantee, the city shall
not in any way be bound to complete the project.
c. The developer shall furnish a maintenance guarantee covering all off-site improvements.
The guarantee shall be in the form of cash, cashiers check, or irrevocable letter of credit
satisfactory to the City Attorney. At a minimum, the maintenance guarantee shall be in
the amount of 15 percent of the engineers cost estimate, reviewed and approved by the
city, for the improvements. The maintenance guarantee shall be provided prior to

ARTICLE 10: CONCURRENCY STANDARDS
10.1 INTENT AND APPLICABILITY
The intent of this article is to provide the regulatory mechanism for determining that a
property owner meets the concurrency provisions of the Comprehensive Plan which
ensures that adequate public facilities are available at acceptable levels of service.
10.2 DEFINITIONS
Central City Transit Supportive Area: Area within which less stringent roadway levelsof-
service are allowed due to the presence of a traditional street grid network, extensive
bicycle and pedestrian networks and transit services and facilities. Levels-of-service may
be measured on an averaged corridor basis for facilities with common trip ends.
Certificate of Concurrency: The certificate issued by the Community Development
Department upon finding that an application for a development approval will not result
in the reduction of the level of service standards set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.
For developments with residential uses, this shall include a confirmation of adequate
school capacity as determined by the Polk County School Board.
Concurrency: When adequate public facilities meeting the level of service standard are
in place at the time a development permit is issued, or a development permit is issued
subject to the determination that the necessary facilities will be in place when the
impacts of the development occur, as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.
Concurrency Determination: A non-binding determination of what public facilities and
services are available at the date of inquiry. Projects requiring a major traffic study must
obtain a letter signed by the Community Development Department approving the
methodology for that specific study as detailed in the Departments memo regarding
Major Traffic Study Review Requirements. Projects requiring a school capacity
determination shall be required to provide information as required by the Community
Development Department and as in collaboration with the Polk County School Board.
Concurrency Management System: The procedures and processes utilized by the city to
determine that development approvals, when issued, will not result in the reduction of
the level of service standards set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.
Concurrency Service Areas (Schools): Those geographic areas within which the school
level of service will be measured when an application for final development is reviewed
which includes non-exempt residential uses. Contiguous School Concurrency Service
Areas are those that have an adjacent (coterminous) boundary.
De Minimis Development: A proposed development relating to land use of such a low
intensity as to have a de minimis effect, if any, upon the level of service standards set
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.2
forth in the Comprehensive Plan; such development shall be exempt from concurrency
review. Development approvals for single-family dwellings shall be deemed de minimis.
Any development generating less than 120 average daily trips shall be deemed de
minimis for purposes of assessing transportation levels of service.
Development: The particular development activity authorized by the unexpired
development approval issued for a specific project.
Development Approvals: The following unexpired development approvals shall be
considered to be final development approvals for purposes of issuance of a Certificate
of Concurrency:
a. final subdivision plat approval,
b. final site plan approval, and
c. building permit
Development Actions: An action of the city which requires a non-binding concurrency
determination such as a land use amendment to the Comprehensive Plan or a rezoning.
Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH) Capacity: The report of the permanent
capacity of existing public school facilities. The FISH capacity is the number of students
that may be housed in a facility (school) at any given time as determined by the Florida
Department of Educations Office of Educational Facilities. In the Polk County School
District, permanent capacity does not include temporary classrooms unless they meet
the standards for long-term use pursuant to Section 1013.20, Florida Statues.
Public Facilities and Services: The following public facilities and services for which level
of service standards have been established in the Comprehensive Plan:
a. Potable water
b. Wastewater
c. Drainage
d. Solid waste
e. Parks and recreation
f. Transportation
g. Public Schools
Spot Zone: An area zoned to a particular school that is not in the immediate
neighborhood of that school facility in order to facilitate desegregation and balance
socio-economic diversity.
Student Capacity: The estimated number of students (in full-time equivalency) that can
be satisfactorily housed in a facility at any given time based upon a percentage of the
total number of satisfactory student stations.
Temporary Classroom: A movable or portable classroom facility also known as a
relocatable.
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.3
Transit Agency: The Lakeland Area Mass Transit District or successor agency.
Vested Rights: The right of certain property owners secured by obtaining a
determination that their property is exempt from the concurrency provisions of the
Comprehensive Plan.
10.3 APPLICATIONS

Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.4
10.4 TRANSPORTATION CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT
10.4.1 TRANSPORTATION PROPORTIONATE FAIR-SHARE PROGRAM
a. Applicability
The Proportionate Fair-Share Program shall apply to all developments in the city that
have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a
transportation facility in the city CMS, including transportation facilities maintained by
FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations. The
Proportionate Fair-Share Program does not apply to developments of regional impact
(DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under §163.3180(12), F.S., or to developments
exempted from concurrency as provided herein and including those with de minimis
impacts. The Proportionate Fair-Share Program does not preclude applicants from
funding transportation improvements pursuant to a development agreement to meet
concurrency requirements.
b. General Requirements
1. An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements
of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the
following requirements:
(a) The proposed development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and
applicable land development regulations.
(b) The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the city CIE or the longterm
schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS
includes the construction phase of a transportation improvement(s) that,
upon completion, shall satisfy the requirements of the city transportation
CMS.
2. The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency
through the Proportionate Fair-Share Program by adding an improvement
(construction phase) to the CIE or adopted long-term CMS that will satisfy the
requirements of the city transportation CMS. For the purposes of the
Proportionate Fair-Share Program, no capacity road project shall be added to the
CIE unless any required alignment study or a Project Development and
Environmental (PD&E) Study has been completed with an endorsed build
alternative.
To implement this option, the city shall adopt, by resolution or ordinance, a
commitment to add the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital
improvements in the CIE or long-term schedule of capital improvements for an
adopted long-term CMS no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To
qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be
reviewed by the appropriate city body, and determined to be financially feasible
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.5
pursuant to §163.3180(16) (b) 1, F.S., consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, and
in compliance with the provisions of this article. Any improvement project
proposed to meet the developers fair-share obligation must meet the design
standards of the jurisdiction with maintenance responsibility for the subject
transportation facility.
c. Memorandum of Understanding
The city shall coordinate with the Florida Department of Transportation, Polk
Transportation Planning Organization, Central Florida Regional Planning Council and
other local governments to implement the provisions of the Proportionate Fair-Share
Program. Appropriate provisions for intergovernmental coordination shall be detailed
in a Memorandum of Understanding on the Proportionate Fair-Share Program (MOU),
and city shall coordinate with the signatory parties to ensure that mitigation to
impacted facilities is based on comprehensive and consistent transportation data.
d. Application Process
1. Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the
applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy
transportation concurrency through the Proportionate Fair-Share Program.
2. Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a preapplication
meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, e.g., project status in CIE,
application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related
issues. If the impacted facility is on the SIS, or any state transportation facility,
then the FDOT shall be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application
meeting.
3. Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an
application fee as established by a resolution of the City Commission of the City of
Lakeland, and the following:
(a) Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent;
(b) Property location, including parcel identification numbers;
(c) Legal description and survey of property;
(d) Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development;
(e) Phasing schedule, if applicable;
(f) Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method(s);
(g) Copy of concurrency application;
(h) Copy of the projects traffic study or traffic impact analysis; and
(I) Location map depicting the site and affected road network.
4. The city shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient
and complete within 10 business days. If an application is determined to be
insufficient, incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the
Proportionate Fair-Share Program, then the applicant shall be notified in writing
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.6
of the reasons for such deficiencies within 10 business days of submittal of the
application. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days
of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed
abandoned. The City Commission may, in its discretion, grant an extension of
time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies, provided that the applicant
has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect
a cure.
5. Pursuant to §163.3180(16) (e), F.S., proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation
for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrence of the
FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the
applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement.
6. When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant
shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and
binding agreement shall be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction
from the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy
to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a SIS facility,
or any state transportation facility, no later than 60 days from the date at which
the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer
than 45 working days prior to the Commission meeting when the agreement will
be considered.
7. The city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the Commission meeting
when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fairshare
agreement shall be effective until approved by the Commission, or pursuant
to staff approval for agreements below a certain dollar amount.
e. Determining Proportionate Fair-Share Obligation
1. Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without
limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and
construction and contribution of facilities as provided in §163.3180 (16) (c), F.S.
2. A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fairshare.
The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the
impacted facilities shall not differ based on the form of mitigation as provided in
§163.3180 (16) (c), F.S. (contributions of private funds, land or facility
construction).
3. The methodology used to calculate an applicants proportionate fair-share
obligation shall be as provided for in Section 163.3180 F.S. To the extent not
inconsistent with Section 163.3180, F.S., the following is intended as a guide for
calculating proportionate share and the costs of subject transportation mitigation
measures:
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.7
The cumulative number of peak hour, peak direction trips from the complete
buildout of the proposed development, or buildout of the stage or phase being
approved, that are assigned to the proportionate share program segment divided
by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of the
proportionate share program segment resulting from construction of the
proportionate share program improvement, multiplied by the anticipated cost of
the proportionate share project. In this context, cumulative does not include
project trips from previously approved stages or phases of development.
This methodology is expressed by the following formula: Proportionate Fair
Share = S[ [(Development Tripsi) / (SV Increasei)] x Costi ]
Where:
(a) S = Sum of all deficient links proposed for propor??onate fair-share
mitigation for a project;
(b) Development Tripsi = Those trips from the stage or phase of
development under review that are assigned to roadway segment i
and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management
system (CMS);
(b) SV Increasei = Service volume increase provided by the eligible
improvement to roadway segment i;
(c) Costi = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment i. Cost shall
include the cost of all project phases (preliminary engineering or
alignment study, design, rights-of-way acquisition and construction) in
the years said phases will occur with all associated costs.
4. The cost of the proportionate fair-share project shall be determined by the
maintaining jurisdiction. If any road is determined to be transportation deficient
without the project traffic under review, the costs of correcting that deficiency
shall be removed from the projects proportionate-share calculation and the
necessary transportation improvements to correct that deficiency shall be
considered to be in place for the purposes of the proportionate-share calculation.
5. The value of right-of-way dedications used for proportionate fair-share payment
shall be subject to the approval of the maintaining jurisdiction. No value shall be
assigned to right-of-way dedications required under ordinance or as a condition of
development approval.
f. Impact Fee Credit
1. The city shall maintain a list of transportation projects funded by road impact fees
under the CIE. If the subject improvement is contained in the current CIE and
funded in part or whole by road impact fees, the proportionate fair-share
contributions shall be applied as a credit against road impact fees.
2. Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution shall be
determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.8
proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant shall be reduced per
the Proportionate Fair-Share Agreement as they become due per the citys
adopted Impact Fee Ordinance and per provisions in Ch. 163.3180 F.S.. If the
applicants proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the developments
anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under
review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee
amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of the city impact fee ordinance.
3. The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation
impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road
impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a
proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless
provided for within the local impact fee ordinance.
4. The amount of traffic impact fee credit for a proportionate fair-share contribution
may be up to, but shall not exceed, the projects proportionate fair-share amount
and shall be determined based on the following formula: Credit = [(Cost of
Proportionate Share Project) ÷ (Total Cost of All Projects in Applicable Impact Fee
District)] x (Total Project Traffic Impact Fee Liability)
Where:
Cost of projects shall include the cost of all project phases in the year said
phases will occur with all associated costs. Credit shall be calculated based
on multiple Proportionate Share Projects, if applicable.
g. Proportionate Fair-Share Agreements
1. Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (Agreement) and
satisfying other concurrency requirements, an applicant shall receive a city
certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for building
permits within the timeframe provided for in the city concurrency certificate, then
the projects concurrency vesting shall expire, and the applicant shall be required
to reapply. Once a proportionate fair share payment for a project is made and
other impact fees for the project are paid, no refunds shall be given. All
payments, however, shall run with the land.
2. Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution for a project and payment
assessed of other road impact fees assessed to that project not subject to an
impact fee credit shall be due and must be paid within 60 days of the effective
date of the proportionate fair share agreement. The effective date shall be
specified in the agreement and shall the date the agreement is approved by the
Commission or its designee.
3. All developer improvements accepted as proportionate fair share contributions
must be completed with three years of the issuance of the first building permit for
the project which is the subject of the proportionate fair share agreement and be
accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.9
of all required improvements. It is the intent of this section that any required
improvements be completed within three years of the issuance of the first
building permit for the project which is the subject of the proportionate fair share
agreement.
4. Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a
proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to the effective date
of the proportionate fair share agreement.
5. Any requested change to a development project subsequent to issuance of a
development order shall be subject to additional proportionate fair-share
contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that
would require mitigation.
6. Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share
agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application
fee and any associated advertising costs to the city shall be nonrefundable.
h. Appropriation of Fair-Share Revenues
1. Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project
account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city CIE, or as otherwise
established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the
discretion of the local government having jurisdiction over the relevant
transportation facility subject to the proportionate fair share agreement, and with
the concurrence of the local government issuing the development order,
proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements
prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fairshare
revenues were derived. These operational improvements shall be
consistent with, and sustainable through, the construction of the capacity project.
Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match
for funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program.
2. In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the
revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of
another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the
impacts of development.
10.4.2 TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT MITIGATION
10.4.2.1 Intend and Applicability
a. Intent
It is the intent of this section to make available concurrency mitigation measures for
development that adversely impacts constrained roadways within designated Transit
Oriented Corridors (TOC) and the Central City Transit Supportive Area (CCTSA). These
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.10
measures may be used at the discretion of the Director of Community Development
to allow automobile traffic to exceed adopted roadway segment capacities in
exchange for the presence of or mitigation funding for bicycle, pedestrian and transit
facilities or services. Concurrency mitigation is in accordance with citys designation as
a Transportation Concurrency Exception Area (TCEA) with locally-preferred
transportation multi-modal level-of-service standards and the goals, policies and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan which support alternative transportation
modes.
b. Applicability
Where development on a TOC or within the CCTSA adversely impacts roadway
segments with volume-to-capacity ratios at or above 1.0, the Director of Community
Development may require the multi-modal mitigation measures set forth herein in
order for the development to obtain a Certificate of Concurrency, depending on the
scale of the development activity and impact on the surrounding road network.
Development seeking a longer transportation concurrency approval horizon than
defined in this article, may request a Development Agreement or other such
instrument to be considered by the city.
10.4.2.2 Mitigation Measures by Type of Development
a. Type of Development: Development located adjacent to a transit stop and generating
at least 120 daily trips.
Mitigation Measures: Construction of a transit bench pad and deployment area in

potential to generate demand for public school facilities and that are proposed or
established after the effective date of this article.
b. Exemptions
The following residential uses or projects shall be exempted from school
concurrency compliance review:
1. Any single family residential development project having construction plan
approval or multifamily residential development project having a current and
unexpired final site plan approval prior to the effective date hereof. Subject
projects shall be deemed concurrent for school facilities. This concurrency
determination shall be subject to the provisions of Sub-Section c. and shall remain
valid for the time period specified based on an effective date of this article.
2. Single family subdivisions actively being reviewed on the effective date hereof
that are determined to be sufficient and approvable by the city. Sufficient and
approvable shall mean a complete application having been submitted, including
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.13
all required items as specified within Section 9.5 of the Land Development
Regulations. Upon receiving final development approval, projects shall be deemed
concurrent for school facilities, subject to the provisions of Sub-Section c.
3. Multi-family project site plans under active review on the effective date hereof
that are determined to be sufficient and approvable by the city. Sufficient and
approvable shall mean a complete application having been submitted, including

Upon receiving final development approval, subject projects shall be deemed
concurrent for school facilities, subject to the provisions of Sub-Section c.
4. Residential development projects that have set aside a site for a public school that
is found acceptable to the School Board and that have agreed to provide site
access and necessary utilities shall be exempt for up to three years from
concurrency for the school level (i.e. elementary, middle or high school) to be
addressed by the future school. A Development of Regional Impact or DRI that has
set aside one or more acceptable school sites and shall provide site access and
necessary utilities shall be exempt for up to five years from concurrency for the
school level(s) to be addressed by said future school(s). Any residential or mixeduse
DRI with an approved Development Order in effect prior to the effective date
hereof shall be exempt from school concurrency for the current phase or to the
extent exempted through an approved development order. Consistent with the
provision of Section 39, Chapter 2005-290, Laws of Florida, this provision shall not
apply to DRIs for which a development order was issued prior to July 1, 2005, or
for which an application was submitted prior to May 1, 2005, unless the
developer elects otherwise in writing.
5. Single family lots of record having received final plat approval or having been

hospitals, bed and breakfast establishments, colleges, motels, hotels, temporary
emergency shelters for the homeless, adult halfway houses, firehouse dorms and
religious non-youth facilities.
8. Two-lot split of a vested parcel in compliance with all other land development
regulations. For purposes of this section, a property owner may not divide a
property into several tracts for development in order to claim exemption under
this section. In making a determination as to whether a property is exempt under
this section, the city shall consider, in addition to the ownership and parcel
configuration at the time of the application, the ownership of the property as of
the effective date of this article.
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.14
9. Age-restricted development projects that are subject to deed restrictions
prohibiting the permanent occupancy of residents under the age of 18 years. Such
deed restrictions must be recorded and must be irrevocable for a period of at
least 30 years, with revocation conditioned upon the project satisfying school
concurrency. Such deed restrictions shall also name the City and Polk County
School Board as parties to be notified in the event that there is proposed change
to the age restriction requirement.
10.5.2 GENERAL
10.5.2.1 School Concurrency Time Limits
Concurrency for school capacity shall be granted for a development project for a period
of 18 months. At a minimum, the project must have commenced rough lot grading
consistent with an approved Water Management District Stormwater Permit within 18
months of the issuance of the citys certificate of concurrency in order for reserved
school capacities to remain valid. This shall not include grading for model homes or
model home centers. If an applicant donates land for a school facility, then concurrency
for schools may be extended for a longer period, subject to approval by the local
government and the School Board. For mixed use or residential DRIs, school
concurrency may be extended for up to five years where the DRI has addressed all
questions regarding school impacts and the Development Order includes conditions to
address mitigation of any school impacts, as agreed to by the School Board including
those defined in the Interlocal Agreement.
10.5.2.2 School Concurrency Service Areas
School Concurrency Service Areas (CSA) are established and may be subsequently
modified to maximize available school capacity and make efficient use of new and
existing public schools. These areas shall be school attendance zones (excluding
attendance spot zones) as expressed in Policy 2-C1 of the Comprehensive Plan Public
School Facilities Element, and are established so that the adopted Level-of-Service will
be achievable and maintained within bounds of the School Boards requirement for
financially feasible five year program of work.
10.5.2.3 Methodology
To ensure that adequate school capacity is available for each school level (elementary,
middle, and high school) and concurrent with the impacts of development, a Level of
Service (LOS) standard of 100 percent of the permanent Florida Inventory of School
Houses (FISH) capacity is in effect for all schools. Pursuant to State legislative changes
to Chapter 163, F.S. in year 2011, school capacity determinations shall include the
capacity of qualified relocatable or portable classrooms as provided in Ch. 163.3180, F.S.
(Ord. No. 5455, § 2, 07-21-14)
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.15
10.5.2.4 School Concurrency Determinations
Upon the receipt of a complete application for a non-binding or binding School
Concurrency Determination, the city will transmit the application to the School Board
for a determination of whether there is adequate school capacity, for each school level
to accommodate the proposed development, based on the LOS standards, CSAs, and
other standards set forth in the Interlocal Agreement.
The City shall issue a binding certification of School Capacity only upon:
a. The School Boards written determination that adequate school capacity will be in
place or under actual construction within three years after the issuance of final
subdivision or site plan approval for each level of school without mitigation; or
b. The execution of a legally binding mitigation agreement between the applicant, the
School Board and the city. If a proposed development project does not meet school
concurrency requirements and is not issued a Certificate of Concurrency, then the
School Board shall place the development into a queue of pending projects for a
period of 18 months. If conditions change such that adequate capacity becomes
available to serve the project, then the applicant and the city shall be notified of the
determination of adequate school capacity.
10.5.2.5 School Concurrency Management
a. A Certificate of Concurrency shall be issued for a development approval, and remain
in effect for the same period of time as the development approval with which it is
issued. If the development approval does not have an expiration date, the Certificate
of Concurrency shall be valid for 18 months, except that transportation concurrency
certificates shall be valid for 36 months, with an additional one year extension
available through administrative approval by the Director of Community Development
or the Directors designee.
b. A Certificate of Concurrency may be accorded the same terms and conditions as the
underlying development approval. If a development approval shall be extended, the
Certificate of Concurrency shall also be extended.
c. A Certificate of Concurrency may be extended to remain in effect for the life of each
subsequent development approval for the same parcel, as long as the applicant
obtains a subsequent development approval prior to the expiration of the earlier
development approval.
d. A Certificate of Concurrency runs with the land, is valid only for the subsequent
development approvals for the same parcel, and is transferable to new owners of the
original parcel for which it was issued.
e. A Certificate of Concurrency shall expire if the underlying development approval
expires or is revoked by the city.
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.16
10.5.3 SCHOOL CONCURRENCY MITIGATION
10.5.3.1 Mitigation Determination
In the event that a proposed development project will exceed the LOS standards, the
Director of Community Development and the Polk County School Board Superintendent
may consider mitigation measures. The following criteria shall be used to determine
whether or not proposed mitigation can adequately offset the impacts of a proposed
development:
a. The proposed mitigation must be directed toward a permanent school capacity
improvement identified by the Polk County School Boards financially feasible Five
Year Program of Work;
b. The proposed mitigation must satisfy the demand(s) created by the proposed
development;
c. The proposed mitigation must be, at minimum, proportionate to the demand for
public school facilities to be created by actual development of the property;
d. If the needed capacity is available in one or more of the contiguous CSAs and the
impacts of the development can be shifted to that CSA, mitigation shall not be
required;
e. The provision of temporary classrooms shall not be accepted as mitigation.
10.5.3.2 Types of School Concurrency Mitigation
If it is determined by both the Director of Community Development and the School
Board Superintendant that a method of mitigation may be acceptable and can offset the
impacts of a proposed development on schools capacity, then one or more of the
following procedures shall be used and made part of a formal mitigation agreement
described above:
a. The donation, construction, or funding of school facilities sufficient to offset the
demand for public school facilities created by the proposed development project.
b. The creation of a mitigation bank based on the construction of a public school facility
in exchange for the right to sell capacity credits.
c. The donation of acceptable land in conjunction with the provision of additional school
concurrency.
d. The provision of additional student stations through the donation of existing buildings
for use as a primary or alternative learning facility as long as the building meets State
Requirements for Educational Facilities (SREF) standards.
Article 10: Concurrency Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 10.17
e. The provision of additional student stations through the renovation of existing
buildings for use as learning facilities as long as the building meets SREF standards.
f. The construction of permanent student stations or core capacity as long as the
building meets SREF standards.
g. The construction of a charter school designed in accordance with School Board and
SREF standards, providing permanent capacity to the Boards inventory of student
stations. The use of a charter school for mitigation must include provisions for its
continued existence, required attendance by students generated by development,
including but not limited to the transfer of ownership of the charter school property
and buildings and/or operation of the school to the School Board.
10.6 APPEALS
An applicant may appeal a determination by the Director of Community Development,
made pursuant to the terms of this article, to the City Commission. Appeals must be filed
with the City Clerk within 30 business days of the determination or decision being
appealed. Appeals shall be heard by the City Commission at an evidentiary hearing at
which the reasons for the decision and the evidence relied upon shall be presented. The
Applicant also shall have the opportunity to present the reason for appeal and evidence in
support of the appeal. At its discretion, the City Commission may: (a) affirm the decision
of the Director of Community Development; (b) remand the matter to the Director of
Community Development for further proceedings; or (c) reverse the decision of the
Director of Community Development. Decisions of the City Commission may be
challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.

significance shall be determined by the DRC at the time of the demolition request
and shall be based upon documentation of the propertys architectural integrity
and historical or cultural significance. Designation of the building or structure as
non-contributing by the most recent historic district survey does not preclude
the DRC from making a determination of architectural significance.
2. The contribution of the building or structure to the history or origins of the
historic district.
Article 11: Historic Preservation Standards
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 11.7
3. The future utilization of the site, including any replacement buildings or
structures.

e. Redevelopment Areas within Historic Districts
1. The DRC shall operate to further the implementation of redevelopment plans
where such plans have been formally adopted within established local or national
historic districts. These redevelopment areas are listed and described below:
(a) Garden District
Adopted by Ordinance 4549, June 21, 2004 this area encompasses the East
Lake Morton Historic District and includes peripheral areas not part of the
original historic district. This includes property located south of East Main St.,
north of East Walnut St., east of South Iowa Ave., and west of Bartow Road.
The redevelopment plan is intended to make the area more attractive for
redevelopment, create high value residential development while preserving
significant historic structures and create an overall character that contributes
to the maintenance of this central city historic neighborhood.
(b) Dixieland CRA Commercial Corridor
Adopted by Ordinance 4592, November 15, 2004 this area encompasses
portions of the Dixieland Historic District. This includes property located

historic district. The DRC shall utilize established guidelines and also
adopt redevelopment plans.
(c) Demolition within redevelopment areas is generally discouraged and
shall be reviewed with regards to:
i. The architectural significance of the building or structure.
Architectural significance shall be determined by the DRC at the time
of the demolition request and shall be based upon documentation of
the propertys architectural integrity and historical or cultural
significance. Designation of the building or structure as noncontributing
by the most recent historic district survey does not
preclude the DRC from making a determination of architectural
significance.
ii. The contribution of the building, structure or site to the history or
origins of the historic district.
iii. The future proposed utilization of the site in relation to specific or
proposed plans. When specific plans are not available for the site, the
proposed plans may include formally established redevelopment
plans or those plans submitted by the applicant that comply and are
compatible with the district and meet the intent of the adopted
redevelopment plan. The demolition review process will take into
consideration a ranking of properties in redevelopment areas based
on architectural significance and integrity as identified by the HPB.
11.6.4 COMPLIANCE
a. The Building Official shall not issue a building permit for any exterior alteration or
demolition of a building, structure or site within a district unless a Certificate of
Review has been approved and issued by the DRC. A permit for demolition may only
be issued upon the issuance of a building permit for the replacement building or
Article 11: Historic Preservation Standards

compliance with the Certificate of Review. The Building Official shall, as part of his
official duties inspect the building to determine compliance with the Certificate of
Review. Failure to comply with the Certificate of Review shall be treated in the same
manner as any other building code or building permit violation, including revocation
of the permit and municipal ordinance violation punishable as provided in the City
Code.
11.7 ENFORCEMENT AND APPEALS
If the DRC denies an application for a Certificate of Review, the applicant may appeal to
the Historic Preservation Board. Such an appeal must be taken within 14 days of the DRCs
decision. The HPB shall by rule establish procedures for processing appeals. The Applicant
may not take an appeal from an adverse decision of the HPB to the City Commission. Any
other possible remedies are in a court of law or equity.

applicant rather than by neighbors or the general public;

variances where substantial compliance can be achieved. No property owner shall be
entitled to such adjustments which are at the discretion of the Director Community
Development or other administrative staff as specified herein.
b. It is further the intent of this Code that such administrative adjustments:
? Be granted only as needed to relive hardship suffered by the applicant due to

necessary to allow the safe and functional operation of the site or to
accommodate other code requirements;
? Be consistent with the intent of this Code and of the applicable zoning district,
including any applicable conditional use, PUD or SPI district;

mitigated; and
? Be the minimum deviations that will alleviate the unnecessary hardship.

standards including but not limited to the placement of buildings, driveways, parking

12.7.3 APPEAL TO THE CITY COMMISSION
Any aggrieved or adversely affected party, as defined in Section 163.3215, Florida
Statutes, may appeal a decision of the Planning and Zoning Board to the City
Commission based upon one or more of the following grounds:
a. the Planning and Zoning Board failed to properly follow adopted procedure or due
process requirements;
b. the Planning and Zoning Board failed to properly apply adopted standards or
regulations;
c. administrative staff failed to follow professional practice in performing technical
analysis;
d. no competent, substantial evidence was presented to the Planning and Zoning
Board to support its decision; or
e. new evidence has been discovered that, through the exercise of proper diligence,
could not have been discovered prior to the public hearing before the Planning and
Zoning Board.
The applicant shall file the appeal in writing with the City Attorney within thirty (30)
calendar days of the Boards action, stating the specific reasons for the appeal. Failure
to timely file an appeal meeting the criteria set forth herein shall constitute a waiver of
the right to appeal. The City Attorney shall place an appeal meeting the criteria set
forth herein on a City Commission agenda occurring within sixty (60) calendar days of
receipt of the applicants written appeal and shall cause public notice of the hearing on
the appeal to be given in accordance with Sub-Section 12.6.1.1. An appeal may be
scheduled beyond sixty (60) calendar days for good cause.
Upon consideration of the appeal, the City Commission shall first determine whether
one or more of the above grounds for appeal exist. If the Commission does not find that
at least one of the above grounds exists, the Commission shall deny the appeal and
affirm the decision of the Planning and Zoning Board. If the Commission finds that one
or more of the above grounds exist, the Commission shall then, at the same meeting,
conduct a full public hearing on the merits of the case. The hearing may be continued
by the Commission to a later date for good cause. At the hearing, the City Commission
may consider both new testimony and evidence, as well as the record created before
the Planning and Zoning Board. Following the hearing, the City Commission may:
a. affirm the decision of the Planning and Zoning Board;
b. remand the case to the Board for reconsideration; or
Article 12: Administration and Enforcement
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 12.19
c. reverse, in whole or in part, or modify the decision of the Board and direct staff to
prepare an ordinance or other appropriate instrument granting relief in accordance

Article 13: Nonconformities
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 13.1
ARTICLE 13 NONCONFORMITIES
13.1 INTENT
It is the intent of this article to establish regulations and limitations on the continued
existence of uses, lots and structures legally established prior to the effective date of
this Code that do not conform to the provisions of this Code. Many such
nonconformities may continue but the provisions of this article are designed to curtail
substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about their eventual elimination,
where appropriate, to preserve the integrity of this Code.
13.2 GENERAL
13.2.1 SITE PLAN APPROVAL BINDING
Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any building for which a site plan was approved prior to the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Code and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on with a valid building permit. Actual
construction shall include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or
removal shall be deemed to be actual construction.
13.2.2 PUBLIC TAKINGS
If, as the result of a lawful public taking, a lot, use or structure violates any provision of
this Code, such lot, use or structure shall be deemed to be nonconforming and shall be
treated in exactly the same manner as if the nonconformity had existed on the effective
date of this Code.
13.2.3 CALCULATION OF COSTS
Maintenance costs, repair costs and replacement costs shall be determined by the same
method as for the purpose of issuing a building permit. Such method shall be based on
factual sources set forth in tables or the formulas approved from time to time by
resolution of the City Commission.
13.2.4 CHANGE OF TENANCY, OWNERSHIP OR MANAGEMENT
There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing
nonconforming uses of land, of structures, or of structures and land in combination.
Article 13: Nonconformities
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 13.2
13.3 USE NONCONFORMITIES
13.3.1 APPLICABILITY
This section shall apply to any nonconformance with requirements or limitations
pertaining to the use of land or structures as set forth in Article 2 and pertaining to the
use standards set forth in Article 5.
13.3.2 STANDARDS
13.3.2.1 Authority to Continue
Any lawfully existing nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the provisions of this section.
13.3.2.2 Increase, Expansion or Intensification of Nonconforming Uses Prohibited
No increase, expansion or intensification of a nonconforming use shall be permitted
except in accordance with Sub-Section 13.3.2.3.
13.3.2.3 Structures Associated with Nonconforming Uses
a. Structure alterations that do not increase, expand or intensify a use nonconformity
and that increase conformance with site development standards or reduce the
negative impact of the nonconforming use, shall be permitted if such alterations are
otherwise lawful.
b. Structures that are utilized by nonconforming uses may be maintained and repaired,
provided that maintenance and repair does not increase, expand or intensify the
nonconforming use, and provided further that the cost of maintenance and repair
subject to any one permit does not exceed 25 percent of the replacement cost of the
subject structure within any 12 month period. No limit is placed on the aggregate
number of permits that may be issued during the life of a nonconforming use under
this section, but permits shall only be issued as frequently as necessary to allow such
maintenance and repair as required to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
13.3.2.4 Change of Nonconforming Use
a. Subject to conditional use approval, a nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use if the new nonconforming use reduces the extent, intensity or
degree of use nonconformity that previously existed. If the new nonconforming use is
established, the previous nonconforming use shall not be reestablished.
b. Nothing in this article shall prohibit any otherwise lawful action associated with the
change of a nonconforming use to a conforming use. If a conforming use is
established, the previous nonconforming use shall not be reestablished.
Article 13: Nonconformities
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 13.3
13.3.2.5 Termination of Nonconforming Use
a. Whenever a structure utilized by a nonconforming use is destroyed, the use of such
structure by that or any other nonconforming use shall terminate immediately and
shall not thereafter be reestablished. For the purposes of this section, 'destroyed'
shall constitute damage or demolition by any means to such an extent that repair or
replacement would exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of all structures that
are used for the nonconforming use.
b. Any nonconforming use of land alone or land and minor structures in combination
shall be terminated within three years of the effective date of this Code. For the
purposes of this section, minor structures shall be structures with a replacement cost
that does not exceed 10 percent of the market value of the land on which they are
located. Market value shall be determined in the same manner used to determine the
value of land condemned for lawful public taking.
13.3.2.6 Reestablishment of Nonconforming Use
A use nonconformity shall not be reestablished after it has ceased to operate for a
period of 365 consecutive days. Time periods in which uses are discontinued due to
impeded access resulting from government action shall not be considered in applying
this restriction. For purposes of this Code, the presence of a mobile home as a
nonconforming structure in a zoning district shall be considered a nonconforming use,
subject to removal when its actual use or occupancy has ceased for a period of 365
consecutive days.
13.3.2.7 Subdivision Prohibited
Land that accommodates a use nonconformity shall not be subdivided.
13.3.2.8 Single-Family Dwelling Units in Non-Single-Family Districts
Notwithstanding Sub-Section 13.3.2.3, any single-family dwelling unit located in a
non-single-family district other than an industrial district shall be permitted to be
repaired, enlarged, altered or rebuilt, provided that the dwelling unit otherwise meets
the minimum requirements of the least restrictive single-family sub-district allowed in
the context in which the dwelling unit is located.
13.3.2.9 Conditional Use Nonconformity
Any use designated by this Code as a conditional use for which conditional use
approval has not been granted in accordance with Section 2.4 shall be deemed a use
nonconformity until a conditional use is approved.
13.3.2.10 City Purchase or Condemnation of Nonconforming Uses
The elimination of the nonconforming uses and structures is declared to be for a public
purpose and for a public use. The City of Lakeland may acquire, by purchase,
Article 13: Nonconformities
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 13.4
condemnation, or otherwise, private property or an interest in private property for the
removal of nonconforming uses. The cost and expense, or a portion thereof, of
acquiring the private property may be paid from general funds or assessed to a special
district in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions relating to the creation
and operation of special assessment districts for public improvements in the city. The
City Commission may institute and prosecute proceedings for condemnation of
nonconforming uses and structures under the power of eminent domain.
13.4 LOT NONCONFORMITIES
13.4.1 APPLICABILITY
This section shall apply to any nonconformance with requirements or limitations
pertaining to lot arrangement, lot area, lot width or minimum street frontage as set
forth in Sub-Section 9.8.4 and Tables 3.4-1 through 3.4-13.
(Ord. No. 5455, § 2, 07-21-14)
13.4.2 STANDARDS
13.4.2.1 Authority to Continue
Any lawfully existing nonconforming lot may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the provisions of this section.
13.4.2.2 Nonconforming Lots
Lots and parcels created prior to July 18, 1950 that do not meet the minimum lot area,
lot width and/or lot depth requirements of this Code, may be built upon without
recourse to a variance, provided that all height, setback and other applicable
dimensional requirements are met. Where conformance to the dimensional
requirements would cause unnecessary hardship, the Zoning Board of Adjustment and
Appeals may issue a variance to permit use of such lots.
13.4.2.3 Division of Lots Restricted
No lot or parcel shall be divided in such a way as to create a nonconforming lot or parcel
or to increase the degree of nonconformance already in existence.
13.5 STRUCTURE NONCONFORMITIES
13.5.1 APPLICABILITY
This section shall apply to any nonconformance with requirements or limitations
pertaining to structures.
Article 13: Nonconformities
City of Lakeland Land Development Code Page 13.5
13.5.2 STANDARDS
13.5.2.1 Authority to Continue
Any lawfully existing nonconforming structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of this section.
13.5.2.2 Unsafe Structures
Any structure or portion thereof declared unsafe by the Building Official or Fire Official
pursuant to the provisions of the building code or fire code may be restored to a safe
condition, notwithstanding the provisions of Sub-Section 13.3.2.3.
13.5.2.3 Creation or Increase of Structure Nonconformities Prohibited
No structure shall be constructed, enlarged or altered in such a way as to create a new
structure nonconformance or to increase an existing structure nonconformance.
13.5.2.4 Enlargement or Alteration of Nonconforming Structures
a. When a structure exhibits one or more nonconformities, the structure may be
enlarged or altered in any lawful way for any permitted use, provided that the
enlargement or alteration does not create a new nonconformity.
b. When a structure exhibits one or more nonconformities, the structure shall not be
enlarged or altered so as to increase an existing nonconformity, except as follows:
Where 60 percent or more of the total length of a façade of an existing structure is
nonconforming as to a particular minimum setback, the structure may be enlarged
within the same required yard, not to exceed the actual setback of the existing facade,
as illustrated in Figure 13.5-1.
13.5.2.5 Maintenance and Repair of Nonconforming Structures
Subject to Sub-Section 13.3.2.3, nonconforming structures may be maintained and
repaired, provided that maintenance and repair do not increase or intensify the extent
or size of the nonconformity.
13.5.2.6 Destroyed Nonconforming Structures
Whenever a nonconforming structure is destroyed, the nonconforming structure shall
not be rebuilt except in conformance with all the requirements of this Code. For the
purposes of this section, 'destroyed' shall constitute damage by any means to such an
extent that the cost of repair or replacement would exceed 50 percent of the
replacement cost of the structure before it was destroyed.
