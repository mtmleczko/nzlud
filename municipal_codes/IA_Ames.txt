but that the electors of the city or ward, as the case may be, have the right to file a petition requiring that the vacancy
be filled by a special election. The council may publish notice in advance if a member of the council submits a
resignation to take effect at a future date. The council may make an appointment to fill the vacancy after the notice is
published or after the vacancy occurs, whichever is later. However, if within fourteen days after publication of the
notice or within fourteen days after the appointment is made, there is filed with the city clerk a petition which

electors of a city for a valid petition shall be at least two thousand signatures or at least the number of signatures
equal to ten percent of the voters who voted for candidates for the office at the preceding regular election at which
the office was on the ballot, whichever number is fewer.

council opts for a special election or a valid petition is filed under paragraph "a", the special election may be held
concurrently with any pending election as provided by Iowa law if by so doing the vacancy will be filled not more
than ninety days after it occurs. Otherwise, a special election to fill the office shall be called at the earliest
practicable date. If there are concurrent vacancies on the council and the remaining council members do not
constitute a quorum of the full membership, a special election shall be called at the earliest practicable date. The
council shall give the county commissioner at least thirty-two days' written notice of the date chosen for the special
election. The dates for actions in relation to the special election shall be calculated with regard to the date for which
the special election is called, as provided by Iowa law.

CHAPTER 5A
CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
Sec. 5A.1. FINDINGS.
(1) The U.S. EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program
(Program) administered by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (“IDNR”) requires that cities meeting certain
demographic and environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the discharge of storm
water from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) (MS4 Permit). The City of Ames is subject to the
Program and is required to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 Permit. The City’s MS4 Permit is on file at the office
of the city clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours.
(2) The Program requires certain individuals engaged in construction activities (applicant or applicants) to
submit an application to the IDNR for a State NPDES General Permit #2. Notwithstanding any provision of this
ordinance, every applicant bears final and complete responsibility for compliance with a State NPDES General
Permit #2 and a City COSESCO Permit and any other requirement of state or federal law or administrative rule.
(3) As a condition of the City’s MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to undertake primary responsibility for
administration and enforcement of the Program by adopting a CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND
SEDIMENT CONTROL (COSESCO) ordinance designed to achieve the following objectives:
(a) Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, state agency or political subdivision
(“applicant”) required by law or administrative rule to apply to the IDNR for a State NPDES General Permit #2 shall
also be required to obtain from the City a CONSTRUCTION SITE EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
permit (City COSESCO Permit) in addition to and not in lieu of the State NPDES General Permit #2; and
(b) The City shall have primary responsibility for inspection, monitoring and enforcement procedures
to promote applicants’ compliance with State NPDES General Permits #2 and City COSESCO Permits.
(4) No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the City in administering and enforcing the
Program. Accordingly, the City shall fund its application, inspection, monitoring and enforcement responsibilities
entirely by fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to the Program by virtue of state and
federal law, and/or other sources of funding established by a separate ordinance.
(5) Terms used in this ordinance shall have the meanings specified in the Program.

CHAPTER 5B
POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Sec 5B.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
(1) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit program (Program) administered by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) requires that
cities meeting certain demographic and environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES permit for the
discharge of stormwater from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) (the MS4 Permit). The City of Ames
(City) is subject to the Program and is required to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 Permit. The City’s MS4 Permit is
on file at the office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours.
(2) As a condition of the City’s MS4 Permit, the City is obliged to develop, implement and enforce a
program to address stormwater runoff from new construction and reconstruction projects for which stormwater permit
coverage is required.
(3) No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the City with inspections, monitoring
and/or enforcing the Program. Accordingly, the City shall fund its inspection, monitoring and enforcement
responsibilities entirely by fees imposed on the owners of properties which are made subject to the Program by virtue
of state and federal law, and/or other sources of funding established by a separate ordinance.
(4) Land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of
local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition if left uncontrolled; this uncontrolled stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants, and; stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and
minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites.
(5) Therefore, City establishes this set of City stormwater standards applicable to all surface waters to
provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources
from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development and
other construction activities shall not result in increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with stormwater runoff, is in the public interest and will
prevent threats to public health and safety.
(6) The Iowa Stormwater Management Manual published by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources and maintained by the Iowa Storm Water Education Program establishes guidelines consisting of unified
sizing criteria (water quality volume, channel protection storage volume, overbank flood protection, extreme flood
protection) stormwater management designs, specifications, and best management practices (BMPs). City hereby
finds and declares that the guidelines provided in the Iowa Stormwater Management Manual, and in future editions
thereof, along with any locally adopted modifications, are hereby adopted as the stormwater management standards of
City. Any BMP installation that complies with the provisions of the Iowa Stormwater Management Manual, or future
editions thereof, along with any locally adopted modifications, at the time of installation shall be deemed to have been
installed in accordance with this ordinance.
(7) The purpose of this ordinance is to adopt as City’s standards the guidelines established in the Iowa
Stormwater Management Manual (hereinafter collectively City’s stormwater requirements or standards) in order to
protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public within this jurisdiction. This ordinance seeks
to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(a) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from development within the city limits and
within 2 mile limit where the City has exercised subdivision authority fringe area in order to reduce flooding, siltation,
increases in stream temperature, and stream bank erosion in order to maintain the integrity of stream channels;
(b) Minimize mass grading of sites to preserve natural features and drainageways as well as
protection of open space and impervious cover minimization;
(c) Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
(d) Distribute and minimize runoff by utilizing vegetated areas for stormwater treatment (e.g.
parking lot islands, vegetated areas along property boundaries, front and rear yards, building landscaping. Encourage
infiltration and soil storage of runoff through such practices as bioswales, soil quality improvement with compaction
reduction and compost amendments, bioretention cells and rain gardens. Plant vegetation that does not require
Sup #2019-2 5-2 Rev. 04-01-19
irrigation beyond natural rainfall and runoff from the site;
(e) Mitigate stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through establishment of appropriate minimum stormwater management
standards and BMPs and to ensure that BMPs are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety.
(8) This ordinance shall be applicable to all development and redevelopment applications meeting the
minimum square foot applicability criteria of 5B.1(8)(a) and 5B.1(8)(b), unless eligible for an exemption or granted a
waiver by City under Section 5B.4 of this ordinance. The ordinance also applies to land disturbance activities that are
smaller than the minimum square foot applicability criteria specified in 5B.1(8)(a) and 5B.1(8)(b) if such activities are
part of a larger common plan of development or redevelopment that meets the minimum square foot applicability
criteria of 5B.1(8)(a) and 5B.1(8)(b), even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take
place at different times on different schedules:
(a) City stormwater requirements must be met for a development application to be approved. City
stormwater requirements apply to any new development disturbing one (1) acre or more of land or to any development
disturbing less than said acreage of land if the amount of impervious cover created exceeds 10,000 square feet. New
development includes any new residential, commercial, or industrial subdivision or individual site improvement
requiring a site development plan. The following activities are exempt from this ordinance:
(i) Any agricultural activity.
(ii) Additions or modifications to an existing single family property.
(iii) Storm Water Management Design standards do not apply to any area within a
1,000-foot distance from any City of Ames drinking water well located in the Southeast Well Field and Youth Sports
Complex Well Field. In these specific areas, developments will need to meet requirements for storm water
quality-based treatment or a combination of quantity- and quality-based treatment, as approved by both the Director of
Public Works and the Director of Water and Pollution Control.
(b) City stormwater requirements must be met for a redevelopment application to be approved. City
stormwater requirements apply to redevelopment creating one (1) acre or more of impervious cover.
(Ord. No. 4380, 2-26-19)
(9) Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements is as follows:
(a) It is intended that this ordinance be construed to be consistent with Municipal Code
Chapter 5A Construction Site Erosion and Sediment Control, Chapter 23 Subdivisions, Chapter 28 Utilities, and
Chapter 29 Zoning.
(b) The requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule
or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective
standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

condition).
“Pre-Settlement Land and Vegetation Conditions” means for intended stormwater design calculations, meadow in
good condition.
“Redevelopment” means land disturbance activity in areas where existing land use is commercial, industrial,
institutional, or residential.

unbranched tributary is first order, the stream receiving the tributary is second order etc.
“Unified Sizing Criteria” means an integrated approach to managing stormwater runoff quality and quantity by
addressing the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff from development. The intent is to comprehensively manage
stormwater to remove pollutants and improve water quality, prevent downstream streambank and channel erosion,
reduce downstream overbank flooding and safely convey and reduce runoff from extreme storm events.
“Water Quality Volume” means the runoff resulting from a rainfall depth of 1.25”, or less which is approximately
90% of the rainfall events in Central Iowa. By managing these storms many of the “first flush” pollutants of concern
will be effectively managed on-site.

and nonstructural stormwater BMPs including detailed routine maintenance as well as long-term maintenance of
vegetation, and repair procedures to ensure their continued efficient function shall be provided to the Public Works
Department. These plans will identify the parts or components of a stormwater BMP that need to be maintained and
the equipment, skills or training necessary. The plan shall also indicate who will be responsible for the maintenance of
vegetation at the site. Provisions for the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance
program and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall be included in the plan. Native Iowa
plants and trees shall be considered for use with stormwater BMPs.
(n) Proof of permanent recorded Maintenance Easements that will ensure access to all
stormwater BMPs at the site for the purpose of inspection and repair. These easements will be recorded with the
stormwater management final plan and will remain in effect even with transfer of title to the property.
(o) Dedicating Drainage Easements: Any stormwater BMP outside of the public right-of-way
shall be dedicated in a perpetual unobstructed easement with satisfactory access to a public way and from a public way
to a natural watercourse or to other stormwater management measure. Any such easement shall be secured by the
subdivider or developer and dedicated to the City without cost to the City.
(p) The property owners of residential, commercial, and industrial properties are responsible
for short and long-term maintenance of all water quality practices. The City of Ames accepts long-term
responsibility (e.g. dredging, outlet structure replacement) for large water quantity (flood) control practices (e.g.
detention basins) as part of residential developments. A recorded easement shall be provided to the City of Ames to
cover the entirety of and access to the large water quantity control practices. The property owners have short-term
maintenance responsibility (e.g. mowing, weed control, removal of volunteer trees) of the water quantity (flood)
control practices as part of residential developments. The property owners are responsible for maintenance of all
Sup #2019-2 5-6 Rev. 04-01-19
stormwater facilities as part of commercial and industrial properties.
(q) Copies of all existing SWPPPs (as required by the City’s COSESCO ordinance) current as
of the date of submission of the stormwater management final plan for all construction activities related to
implementing any on-site stormwater BMPs .
(r) For lot development impacted by stormwater BMPs and conveyance features:
(i) The builder shall provide to the Municipal Engineer, or designated City
representative, an Elevation Certificate that is signed and sealed by a land surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized
by law to certify elevation information.
(ii) The Elevation Certificate shall certify that the protected level (lowest opening or
protective flood barrier that achieves the same result) of all buildings shall be a minimum of 3 feet above the 100 year
water surface elevation of stormwater BMPs.
(iii) Building foundations adjacent to stormwater BMPSs and/or stormwater
infrastructure (i.e. conveyance features, inlets, manholes) shall be 3 feet above the 100 year water surface elevation.
(s) Any required storm sewers including foundation drain collector lines shall be separate
from any required sanitary sewers and shall be installed at the subdivider's or developer’s expense and subject to
requirements of the City and shall be adequate to serve all lots or parcels of land within the area to be subdivided.
(i) The storm sewer system shall be designed with due regard to the present and
reasonably foreseeable needs of the area to be subdivided and to the location and capacity of existing storm sewers and
other stormwater management measures available to serve existing and reasonably anticipated development or use of
areas abutting the area to be subdivided.
(ii) Upon determination by Municipal Engineer, such storm sewers may become the
property of the City, upon determination of the Municipal Engineer through the City's inspection, approval, and
acceptance of such sewers, after the subdivider pays to the City any costs associated with their installation including
any reasonable charge for any supervisory or other services provided by the City.
(t) Accommodating Upstream Drainage Areas: Any necessary and appropriate stormwater
BMPs shall be designed to accommodate runoff from any upstream area potentially draining into or through the area
to be subdivided, whether such area is inside or outside the area to be subdivided. Such design shall assume that the
upstream area upon development or redevelopment will be regulated such that volume of surface water runoff shall be
equal to the runoff from the current landuse condition.
(u) Protecting Downstream Drainage Areas: Any development shall provide for mitigation of
any overload condition reasonably anticipated on any existing downstream stormwater BMPs outside the area to be
subdivided, provided that the development or use of the area to be subdivided creates or contributes to such condition.
Sec 5B.4. WAIVERS
(1) Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this ordinance except in
certain redevelopment situations when confronted with difficult site conditions that limit design of such BMPs listed
in the Iowa Stormwater Management Manual. In such case, a written request must be filed to waive implementation
of BMPs in part or in whole. Requests to waive implementation of BMPs in part as defined in 5B.4(2) shall be
submitted to the Municipal Engineer for approval.
(2) Partial Waivers
(a) Partial waivers of BMPs required by this ordinance may be granted for redevelopment
projects if the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this ordinance. At least
one of the following conditions, in successive order, shall be established by applicant based on authoritative written
evidence satisfactory to the Municipal Engineer:
(i) Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the Municipal
Engineer and fully implemented. If the applicant is unable, for good cause shown, to meet the requirements of this
subsection, the applicant shall meet the following condition:
(ii) Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility that has been
approved by the Municipal Engineer. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site
practices and there is a responsible entity legally obligated to monitor the performance of and maintain the efficiency
of stormwater BMPs in accordance with an approved maintenance plan.
(b) In instances where one of the above conditions is established, the applicant must further
establish by authoritative written evidence satisfactory to the Municipal Engineer that the partial waiver will not result
in any of the following impacts to downstream waterways:
(i) deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures;
Sup #2019-2 5-7 Rev. 04-01-19
(ii) degradation of biological functions or habitat;
(iii) accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;
(iv) increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.
Sec 5B.5. FINANCIAL SECURITY AND PERFORMANCE BOND
(1) City shall require the submittal of an installation financial security or bond prior to issuance of
final Certificate of Occupancy in order to insure that the stormwater BMPs are installed as required by the approved
stormwater management final plan:
(a) The amount of the installation financial security or bond shall be the remaining estimated
construction cost of the stormwater BMPs approved in the stormwater management plan. The installation financial
security or bond shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the stormwater
management plan.
(b) The installation financial security or bond shall be released in full only upon submission of "as
built plans" of all stormwater BMPs specified in the stormwater management plan and written certification by a
Licensed Professional Engineer or Professional Landscape Architect or person credentialed in a manner suitable to the
city that the stormwater BMPs have been installed in accordance with the approved stormwater management final plan
and other applicable provisions of this ordinance. City will make a final inspection of stormwater BMPs to ensure
compliance with the approved stormwater management plan and the provisions of this ordinance. Provisions for a
partial pro-rata release of the installation financial security or bond based on the completion of various development
stages can be made at the discretion of the Municipal Engineer.
(Ord. No. 4380, 2-26-19)
(2) City shall also require the submittal of a maintenance performance security or bond prior to issuance
of a permit in order to insure that the stormwater BMPs are maintained in an effective state for a minimum of four
years. This maintenance performance security or bond may be released by the City upon a showing satisfactory to the
Municipal Engineer that:
(a) another bona fide financially responsible legal entity, such as a home-owners’ or similar
organization organized under Iowa law, has been assigned responsibility for maintenance of the stormwater BMPs in
an effective state for the balance of the four year period after assignment; and
(b) said assignee-legal-entity has fully accepted such responsibility in a written document that
qualifies for recording and has been recorded in the county recorder’s office under Iowa law; and
(c) said assignee-legal-entity posts a substitute maintenance performance security or bond
subject to release at the end of the initial four year period upon a further showing by the assignee-legal-entity that the
stormwater BMPs are, in City’s sole judgment, still reasonably effective.
Sec 5B.6. CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION
(1) After construction is completed, applicants are required to submit actual “as built” drawings
satisfactory to City for any stormwater BMPs located on-site. The drawings must show the final design specifications
for all stormwater BMPs and must be certified by a Professional Engineer, Landscape Architect or credentialed in a
manner acceptable to the city. A final inspection by City is required before the release of any performance securities
can occur.
(2) Construction inspections will be conducted by the City or designated representative of the City at
the conclusion of a development or redevelopment project after as-built plans are submitted to the City to ensure the
stormwater BMPs have been built according to the stormwater management plan. For subdivisions, the owner is
responsible for covering actual Engineering cost per City code. For individual site developments, the cost is included
in the COSESCO fee.
(3) Financial security or bond will be released upon acceptance.
Sec 5B.7. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF STORMWATER BMPs
(1) The applicant or owner of every site, or an assignee qualified, shall be responsible for maintaining as-built
water quality BMPs in an effective state.
(2) Prior to the issuance of a COSESCO permit that has a stormwater management BMP as one of its
requirements of the permit, and part of receiving approval of the stormwater management plan, the applicant or owner
of the site agree to provide for access to the BMP and the land it serves at reasonable times for periodic inspection by
City or City’s designee and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the BMP is maintained
in proper working condition to meet City stormwater requirements.
(3) Maintenance of all stormwater management BMPs shall be ensured through the creation of a
Sup #2019-2 5-8 Rev. 04-01-19
maintenance plan that must be approved by City at time of the stormwater management plan approval. As part of the
plan, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the
stormwater management BMPs. The plan shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper
performance of the BMPs between scheduled cleanouts.
(4) All stormwater management BMPs must undergo an annual inspection to document maintenance
and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this ordinance and accomplishment of its purposes.
Any maintenance or repair needs detected must be corrected by the developer or entity responsible in a timely manner,
as determined by City, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to
ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management BMPs.
(5) Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis. Inspections may include, but are
not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and
material or water in storm water BMPs, and evaluating the condition of stormwater management BMPs.
(6) Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of stormwater management BMPs shall make
records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least 3 years. These
records shall be made available to City during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request.
(7) If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the approved plan or any provision
of this ordinance, City, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation by performing all necessary work to place the
BMP in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management BMP becomes a danger to public
safety or public health, City shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management BMP in
writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall have 30 days to effect maintenance and repair of the
stormwater management BMP in an approved manner. After proper notice, City may assess, jointly and severally, the
owner(s) of the stormwater management BMP or the property owners or the parties responsible for maintenance under
any applicable written agreement for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien
on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected
as ordinary taxes.
Sec 5B.8. ENFORCEMENT BY LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION
(1) Violation of any provision of this ordinance may be enforced by civil action including an action for
injunctive relief. In any civil enforcement action, administrative or judicial, the City shall be entitled to recover its
attorneys’ fees and costs from a person who is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated this
ordinance.
(2) Violation of any provision of this ordinance may also be enforced as a municipal infraction within the
meaning of Iowa Code Section §364.22, pursuant to the City’s municipal infraction ordinance.
(3) Restoration of lands: Any violator may be required to restore land to its undisturbed condition. In
the event that restoration is not undertaken within a reasonable time after notice, City may take necessary corrective
action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property until paid.
(4) Holds on Occupation Permits: Occupancy permits shall not be granted until all storm water
management BMPs have been inspected and approved by City.
Sec 5B.9. MEANS OF APPEAL
Any person directly affected by a decision of the Municipal Engineer or other City staff, or a notice or order issued
under this code, shall have the right to appeal. That appeal shall be heard by the City Council. An appeal shall be made
in writing and be filed with the City Clerk no later than 20 days after the date of the notice or order. The written appeal
shall specify in detail the action appealed from, the errors allegedly made by the enforcement officer giving rise to the
appeal, a written summary of all oral and written testimony the applicant intends to introduce at the hearing, including the
names and addresses of all witnesses the applicant intends to call, copies of all documents the applicant intends to
introduce at the hearing, and the relief requested.
An application for appeal shall be based on a claim that:
(1) the true intent of this Code or the rules legally adopted hereunder have been incorrectly interpreted, or
(2) the provisions of this Code do not fully apply, or
(3) the requirements of this Code are adequately satisfied by other means, and the specific proposed
alternative action will increase the degree of general code compliance of the specific system or the building and
premises, or
(4) there are specific fixed conditions that make strict compliance with this Code impracticable, or
(5) required actions cannot be completed within the time limit specified by the Municipal Engineer or other

Buildings of higher quality will be valued at appropriately higher valuations. Square foot costs are adjusted
periodically to reflect changes in material and labor costs, as reported by the Ames City Assessor.
(5) Appeal of building permit valuation. A request to appeal the Building Official’s
determination of building permit valuation may be filed with the Building Official for cause. Such request
must be in writing, and contain a factual basis for review. Such appeals will be reviewed by the Building
Official and may also include review by the City Assessor to assure consistency, accuracy, and fairness. If
it is found the Building Official erred in the determination of building permit valuation, appropriate
adjustment will be made to the permit valuation and the permit fee.
(6) Work commencing before permit issuance - penalty fees. Any person who
commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before
obtaining the necessary permits may be subject to a fee established by the Building Official that shall be in

any work that commences prior to permit approval, i.e., the permit fee may be doubled for such building,
electrical, mechanical, or plumbing work that occurs prior to permit issuance. Additional fees may also be
charged for actual costs of inspections, project research, site visits, and meetings required to obtain code
compliance prior to the point of actual permit approval. Such penalties do not prevent the Division from
also issuing separate municipal infraction citations for each violation of this section.
(7) Related fees. The payment of permit fees for construction, alteration, removal or
demolition work done in connection with the work authorized the permit shall not relieve the applicant or
holder of the permit from the payment of other fees that are prescribed elsewhere in this Code.

b. The required backflow prevention assemblies for
containment shall be installed in horizontal plumbing immediately following the meter or as close to that
location as deemed practical by the Administrative Authority unless approved in writing by the
Administrative Authority. In any case, it shall be located upstream of any branch piping. Installation at this
point does not eliminate the responsibility of the customer to protect the water supply system from
contamination or pollution between the backflow prevention assembly and the water main, and to protect
the water supply system from contamination or pollution within the premises.
c. If hot water is used within the water system, thermal
expansion shall be provided for when installing a backflow prevention assembly for containment.

property, or private water system receiving water service.
b. The Administrative Authority may order that water
service be temporarily shut off when backflow occurs in a customer's building, property, or private water
system. Such shut off is to protect the system from further contamination or pollution and to allow time for
locating and mitigating the cause and extent of the contamination or pollution.
(xii) Existing Backflow Prevention Assemblies For Containment
a. All backflow prevention assemblies for containment
installed prior to November 1, 1996, that do not meet the requirements of these regulations but were
approved testable assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been
properly installed and maintained, shall, except for the testing, inspection, and maintenance requirements
under Section (x) and Section (xi), be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the
Administrative Authority is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the PWS. Whenever the existing
assembly for containment is moved from the present location, requires replacement, or when the use of the
service area protected by the assembly changes so that the Administrative Authority determines that the
customer no longer qualifies for a partial exemption, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow
prevention assembly for containment meeting the requirements of these regulations.
(xiv) Customer Non-compliance
a. In case of non-compliance with these regulations, the
Administrative Authority shall notify the customer to comply within ten working days. In the event of

the repairs in a manner acceptable to the city within the agreed time period, together with written
extensions thereto, the Building Official may proceed to demolish or abate the structure.

CHAPTER 9
FLOOD PLAIN ZONING REGULATIONS
Sec. 9.1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSE.
(1) Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the State of Iowa has, in Chapter 414 Code of Iowa,
delegated the responsibility to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health
and the general welfare.
(2) Findings of Fact.
(a) The flood hazard areas of Ames are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of
life and property; health and safety hazards; disruption of commerce and governmental services; extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief; and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the
health, safety, and general welfare of the community.
(b) These flood losses, hazards and related adverse effects are caused by (i) the occupancy of flood
hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being
inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood, and (ii) the cumulative effect of flood plain construction on
flood flows, which causes increases in flood heights and flood water velocities.
(c) This ordinance relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is
consistent with the standards established by the Department of Natural Resources. This methodology consists of a
series of interrelated steps including:
(i) Determination of flood magnitudes and the corresponding flood frequencies by
statistical and engineering calculations which permits a consideration of such flood factors as expected frequency of
occurrence, area inundated, and depth of inundation.
(ii) Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of
the capability of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey flood flows.
(iii) Computation and delineation of a floodway, an area which must be reserved (with no
additional obstructions) for conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be substantially
increased by future encroachment on the flood plain.
(3) Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by
minimizing those flood losses described in Section 9.1(2) with provisions designed to:
(a) Reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and
velocities will not be increased by greater than one (1) foot.
(b) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or
which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities.
(c) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement.
(d) Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of
flood hazard.
(e) Assure that eligibility to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance
Program is maintained for property owners in the community.
Sec. 9.2. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
(1) Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the
City of Ames, Iowa, shown on the Official Flood Plain Zoning Map to be within the “Special Flood Hazard Areas
Subject to Inundation by the 1% Annual Chance Flood”.
(2) Establishment of Official Flood Plain Zoning Map. The Story County, Iowa and Incorporated Areas
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), City of Ames, Panels 19169C0135E, 140E, 141E, 142E, 155E, 161E, 162E,
164E, 168E, 170E, 276E and 277E, dated February 20, 2008 and Panels 137F, 139F, 143F, 144F, 163F, 256F and
257F, dated October 16, 2014, which were prepared as part of the Flood Insurance Study for Story County and
digital FIRM equivalents are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be the Official Flood Plain Zoning Map.
(3) Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries. The boundaries of the zoning district shall be
determined by scaling distances on the Official Flood Plain Zoning Map. Where
Sup #2016-3 9-2 Rev. 07-01-16
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official Zoning
Map, the Flood Plain Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation, provided however, that the Flood Plain
Administrator may require the owner to provide a topographic survey of the land to assist in that interpretation. The
person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her
case and submit technical evidence.
(4) Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this ordinance.
(5) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate or Impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions,
the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(6) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be
minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes.
(7) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger
floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice
jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This ordinance does not imply that areas outside the flood plain
districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Ames, Iowa, or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(8) Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this ordinance is adjudged Unconstitutional
or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
Sec. 9.3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING OVERLAY DISTRICTS.

have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of three (3) feet above the base flood elevation
level, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When floodproofing is
utilized, a professional engineer licensed in the State of Iowa shall certify that the floodproofing methods used are
adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated
with the base flood elevation level, and that the structure, below the base flood elevation level, is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific
elevation to which any structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Flood Plain Administrator.
(d) Factory-built homes:
(i) Factory-built homes including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or
subdivisions shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.
(ii) Factory-built homes including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or

eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply treatment facilities shall be provided with a level
of protection equal to or greater than three (3) feet above the base flood elevation.
(iv) Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk associated with such flood damaged or impaired
systems.
(f) Storage of materials and equipment that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human,
animal or plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of three (3) feet above the base flood elevation level.
Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or (i) not be subject to major flood damage and be
anchored to prevent movement due to flood waters or (ii) be readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
(g) Flood control structural works such as levees and flood walls, shall provide, at a minimum,
protection from a base flood elevation with a minimum of 3 ft. of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate
interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be approved by the Department of Natural
Resources.
(h) No use shall affect the capacity or conveyance of the channel or floodway of any tributary to
the main stream, drainage ditch, or other drainage facility or system. In addition, the Department of Natural

subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a licensed
professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
a. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings
or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Such areas shall be used solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, and low damage potential storage.
1. New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
2. New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed
and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
(l) Recreational vehicles placed on sites within the Floodway Fringe Overlay District shall:
(i) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and
(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for

determination made by Administrator in the enforcement of this Ordinance, the aggrieved party may appeal such
action. Applications for Appeals shall be submitted to the Administrator, who shall forward such to the Zoning
Board of Adjustment for consideration. Such applications shall include information ordinarily submitted with
applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The notice
of appeal shall be submitted to the Administrator and shall set forth the specific reason for the appeal. The
Administrator shall transmit to the Zoning Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
(d) Variances. Requests for Variances shall be submitted to the Administrator who shall
forward such to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Such requests shall include information ordinarily submitted with
applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The
Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this
Sup #2016-3 9-8 Rev. 07-01-16
ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a strict enforcement of the
provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following
applicable standards:
(i) No variance shall be granted for any development within the Floodway Overlay
District which would result in any increase in the base flood elevation. Consideration of the effects of any
development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be
allowed for similarly situated lands.
(ii) Variances shall only be granted upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause,
(b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in an unnecessary hardship to the applicant, and (c)
a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense; create nuisances, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
(iii) Variance shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(iv) In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for
buildings than what is ordinarily required by this Ordinance, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the
signature of the Administrator that (a) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and (b) such construction increases risks to
life and property.
(v) All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the Department
of Natural Resources.
(e) Hearings and Decisions of the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
(i) Hearings. Upon the filing with the Zoning Board of Adjustment of a request for
a Conditional Use, an Appeal, or a request for a Variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing. The Board shall fix
a reasonable time and publish notice of the hearing. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney and present written or oral evidence. The Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such
information as is reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a
licensed professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Department of Natural Resources.
(Ord. No. 4087, 09-27-11)
(ii) Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on a Conditional Use, Appeal, or
Variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an Appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in writing, setting forth the
findings of fact and the reasons for its decision. In granting a Conditional Use or Variance the Board shall consider
such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant sections of this ordinance and may prescribe such
conditions as described below.
a. Factors Upon Which the Decision of the Board Shall be Based. In
passing upon requests for Conditional Uses or Variances, the Zoning Board shall consider all relevant factors
specified in other sections of this ordinance and:
1. The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments.
2. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
3. The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
4. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
5. The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
6. The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
7. The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
8. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
9. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and flood plain management program for the area.
10. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
Sup #2016-3 9-9 Rev. 07-01-16
11. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
12. Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
ordinance.
b. Conditions attached to Conditional Uses or Variances. Upon
consideration of the factors listed above, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of Conditional Uses
or Variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this ordinance. Such conditions may include, but are not
limited to:
1. Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
2. Limitation on period of use and operation.
3. Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed
restrictions.
4. Requirements for construction of channel modification, dikes,
levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of Natural Resources and are
deemed the only practical alternative to achieving the purpose of this ordinance.
5. Floodproofing measures. Floodproofing measures
shall be designed consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, durations,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with the regulatory flood. The Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a licensed professional
engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated
flood factors for the particular area. Such floodproofing measures may include, but are not necessarily limited to the
following:
a) Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement.
b) Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, and
shutters, or similar methods of construction.
c) Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressure.
d) Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce
seepage of water through walls.
e) Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist
flotation.
f) Installation of pumps to lower water levels in
structures.
g) Construction of water supply and waste treatment
systems so as to prevent the entrance of flood waters.
h) Pumping facilities or comparable practices for
subsurface drainage systems for building to relieve external foundation wall and basement flood pressures.
i) Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by
water pressure or floating debris.
j) Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and
storm drains which will permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and storm waters into the
buildings or structures.
k) Location of all electrical equipment, circuits and
installed electrical appliances in a manner which will assure they are not subject to flooding.

safety as required herein.

(3) Application of other codes.
Repairs, additions or alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in accordance with the

Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of this Code, the Building Official shall
have the authority to grant code modifications for individual cases, provided the Building Official shall first find that

details of action granting code modifications shall be recorded and entered in the Inspection Division records.
(2) Alternative materials, methods and equipment.
The provisions of this Code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit any method of

is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this Code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire
resistance, durability and safety.
(3) Required testing.
Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of this Code, or evidence that a material or
method does not conform to the requirements of this Code, or in order to substantiate claims for alternative materials
or methods, the Building Official shall have the authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance, at no
expense to the City of Ames.

Sec. 13.401 PRIOR APPROVALS OF NONCOMPLIANT CONDITIONS
(1) General.
The City of Ames adopted the first Rental Housing Code in 1977. Beginning then, all rental dwellings were required to
register with the City and be periodically inspected to assure continued compliance with minimum maintenance standards
of that Code. Some rental dwellings established prior to enactment of the Code were not in compliance with one or more
of the new standards. Mechanisms were created to evaluate such noncompliant conditions and approve those which could
not, practicably, be made compliant, and were judged to have a minimal impact on public health and safety, or for which
an equivalent alternative method of code compliance could be implemented to achieve the intent of the Code. The
techniques used to resolve these cases were “Retroactive Conversion Permits”, “Board Variances”, and “Administrative
Approvals”.
(2) Retroactive Conversion Permits.
As inspections occurred, it was discovered that about 400 buildings had been previously converted from single family
to multifamily dwellings, or otherwise remodeled, altered or improved without issuance of required building, electrical,
mechanical, or plumbing permits and without zoning approval. Those 400 buildings were found to be noncompliant with
one or more of about 20 of the new standards.
In 1985, the City Council enacted an ordinance that “grandfathered” seven (7) of those code violations, based upon a
conclusion they posed no threat to tenant health or safety and that correction would be impracticable. Approvals of the
following seven (7) conditions were granted to each owner who made application and met conditions for a Retroactive
Conversion Permit:
Supp. 2019-3 13-17 Rev. 7-1-19
(a) Minimum required ceiling height of seven (7) feet in habitable rooms. Some single family
homes converted to include basement apartments were unable to meet this standard and approvals were granted for fixed
obstructions such as beams, water and gas pipes, and ductwork that projected to not less than 6 feet 8 inches above the
floor for more than 20% of the floor area of the room.
(b) Minimum room area. Some dwelling units were unable to meet the minimum room area square
footage required by the new code. Such rooms were approvable provided square footage was not less than 75% of that
required by the Code.
(c) Minimum lot area. Some structures were built on small lots and unable to comply with the
newer standards.
(d) Building setbacks. Some structures located on small lots could not comply with newer
required setbacks from property lines.
(e) Lot frontage. Older structures on narrow lots could not comply with newer standards, and in
many cases, houses were built entirely or partially behind one another, making it impossible to comply with newer codes.
(f) Building height.
(g) Minimum required window space for natural light and ventilation. Many basement apartments
were unable to meet this new standard, and approvals were granted for including ‘borrowed’ light from adjoining rooms
in required calculations, and accepting artificial illumination and mechanical ventilation in lieu of natural light and
openable windows.
(3) Board Variances.
Since 1977, the Housing Appeal Board has evaluated cases involving noncompliant conditions other than those eligible
for approval under the Retroactive Conversion Permit process. A number of approvals of specific noncompliant
conditions were granted based upon the Board’s conclusion they posed no threat to tenant health or safety and that
correction would be impracticable, or that an equivalent method of compliance was provided that met the intent of the
Code.
(4) Administrative Approvals.
Since 1977, the Building Official evaluated individual cases of noncompliant conditions in which correction would be
impracticable, such as off-street parking. When it was concluded that such approvals would not create a health or safety
hazard and that compliance with the letter of the code was not possible, Administrative Approvals were granted.
Sec. 13.402 PRIOR APPROVALS SHALL CONTINUE - CONDITIONS
(1) General.
All prior official approvals of noncompliant conditions, as detailed in Section 13.401, above, shall be granted continued
approvals subject to the procedures of this section.
(2) Pre-existing conditions.
After the effective date of this Code, all conditions not in compliance with this Code at the time of inspection shall
henceforth be known as Pre-existing Conditions. Such conditions shall be designated as either Approved or Nonapproved.
(3) Approved Pre-existing Conditions.
An Approved Pre-existing Condition is a condition which received prior approval by any of the 3 methods detailed in
Section 13.401, i.e., Retroactive Conversion Permit, Board Variance, or Administrative Approval, and will receive
continued approval according to the following procedure:
(a) The Building Official or designee shall identify the noncompliant condition at the time of an
inspection and notify the owner.
(b) The owner shall submit an original or a copy of the Retroactive Conversion Permit, Board
Variance, or Administrative Approval issued by the City in regard to the specific condition approved and any provisions
attached thereto. In the event the owner cannot produce the authorizing document, the Inspection Division shall conduct
a reasonable search of City records for such authorizing document.
(c) The Building Official shall verify that the condition has been maintained in a safe and
otherwise code-compliant manner than that for which the approval was specifically granted. Example: where basement
apartment ceiling height of 6 feet 8 inches was previously approved and documented, and such height has been
maintained intact and not reduced as a result of structural deflection, failure, shoring, or other alteration of the floor
system above or raising of the floor below.
Supp. 2019-3 13-18 Rev. 7-1-19
(d) Provided the required documentation is submitted or discovered, and the condition has been
maintained, as described above, then such condition will be documented henceforth as an Approved Pre-existing
Condition.

be granted, the reason therefore, and provide a reasonable time limit for the condition to be brought into compliance with
this Code.
(f) Retroactive Conversion Permits, Board Variances, or Administrative Approvals
authorizing specific noncompliant conditions will be reviewed by the Building Official in accord with this procedure
at or about the date of the regular periodic inspection performed in conjunction with expiration of the current Letter
of Compliance. Retroactive Conversion Permits, Board Variances, or Administrative Approvals meeting the criteria
of this Code shall be recorded henceforth as Approved Pre-existing Conditions. This process will occur during the
period following adoption of this ordinance commencing July 1, 2009, and ending for each rental unit when it
has been subject to a regular periodic inspection in conjunction with expiration of its Letter of Compliance.
Those conditions not specifically approved by Retroactive Conversion Permits, Board Variances, or Administrative
Approvals, and which have not been updated in the Inspection Division records as Approved Pre-existing Conditions
must be brought into compliance with this Code by the dates specified in the relevant sections of this Code.
(Ord. No. 4150, 6-25-13)
(g) Approvals transferable. A condition which is concluded to be an Approved Pre-existing
Condition is transferable from one owner to another, provided such condition is maintained continuously in a safe
and otherwise code-compliant manner. Failure to maintain the approved condition in a safe and otherwise compliant
manner may result in termination of approval, and require compliance with current code provisions, following
appropriate notification and hearing procedures of this Code.
(h) Approvals not available for newly-registered dwellings. Conditions which were approved
by Retroactive Conversion Permit, Board Variance, or Administrative Approval will not be approved for new rental
registration applications. Newly registered rental properties must comply with all provisions of this Code at the time

subsection, the city clerk shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant. If the application is not approved by the
building official, the city clerk shall notify the applicant of the reason or reasons the application was not approved.

The applicant shall be afforded a period of 30 days from the date of the city clerk's notice, within which to revise the

to maintain adequate pedestrian flow, to permit adequate access to building entrances, to safeguard pedestrian and
traffic safety, to preserve the aesthetic quality of the surrounding area, or for any other valid public purpose. The city
reserves the right to either deny an application which otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection, or to
require the proprietor to meet additional terms and conditions for issuance of a permit beyond the requirements set
forth in this subsection if, in the reasonable determination of the city, either granting the permit, or granting it
without such additional terms and conditions, would not adequately protect and preserve the rights, privileges, and
property of the city or its residents, or would not adequately protect or preserve the peace, safety, health, welfare,
comfort or convenience of the city's residents.
(12) The City Manager may order the immediate removal of any such temporary sign in the event such

(15) The city shall retain the right to terminate any permit granted under this subsection upon seven (7)
days' written notice, and may require the removal of the sign from the public sidewalk adjacent to an establishment,
if the city council, after due consideration, determines that there is a reasonable and substantial need for the use of
the public right-of-way being occupied by such sign, for a valid public purpose. The determination of the city council
shall be final, and there shall be no right of appeal from such decision.

issued as part of the insurance policy evidencing compliance with this requirement, and with a copy of the current
insurance certificate maintained on file with the City Clerk; and
(b) An indemnification agreement on a form furnished by the City Clerk, under which the
proprietor agrees to indemnify and hold the city harmless from any liability for damages arising out of the placement
of the temporary movable sign in the public right-of-way.

purposes and utility easements. A City right-of-way does not include the airwaves above a City
right-of-way with regard to cellular or other non-wire telecommunications or broadcasts service or utility
poles owned by the City.
(2) Right-of-Way Users: Those entities, except the City of Ames and Iowa State University, that
own or operate facilities that are or are proposed to be installed within City right-of-way for purposes of
conducting, transmitting or distributing water, drainage, sanitary sewage, electricity, steam, gas, or
electronic communications.
Sec. 22A.2. REGISTRATION.

(f) Proof of registration with the Iowa Aone-call@ system.
(2) Each right-of-way user registration, and registration by the City, shall be accompanied by
such registration fee as shall be set from time to time by the City Council.
(3) The purpose of the registration required by this section is to assist the City in enforcement of
its regulations; and, to assist the City in the abatement of dangerous conditions or conditions that threaten
to interfere with the property of others by reason of the registrant=s facilities.
Sec. 22A.3. RIGHT-OF-WAY INSTALLATION PERMITS.
(1) A right-of-way user shall obtain, by application to the City Director of Public Works, a permit
for installation in the City right-of-way whenever the right-of-way user desires to place, construct, or bury
anything in the City right-of-way. Such application shall be accompanied by:
(a) Written and graphic material that states and shows the particular part of or point on the
city right-of-way where placement, construction, or excavation is proposed to occur.

(c) A sign-off sheet showing that all other registered right-of-way users, the City of Ames
and Iowa State University, with facilities in the vicinity of the proposed installation or repair work have
reviewed the plan for the proposed work and have no objection. So as not to have undue delay, the
right-of-way user making application for the permit need only wait ten working days from the time of
submitting its plans to the other right-of-way users. Failure by a right-of-way user to respond to such
requested plan review within ten (10) days shall constitute an expression of no objection. If there is a
dispute between right-of-way users as to location of the respective facilities of each in a segment of City
right-of-way, the Director of Public Works shall determine the placement of such facilities in a manner
reasonably consistent with how various kinds of facilities are shown to be placed on a model right-of-way
cross section established and maintained on file for public inspection by the Director of Public Works.
(d) Plans and specifications for the proposed work in such detail as the Director of Public
Works shall reasonably require to show that the work as proposed conforms to city ordinances, regulations,

at the time that the installation in the City right-of-way occurs, all excavations and obstructions by proper
placement of barricades, warning lights and such other or additional devices, in accordance with The
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, as circumstances may warrant. If in the opinion of the City
Director of Public Works such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely protected, the City
Director of Public Works shall notify the right-of-way user and the right-of-way user shall comply
immediately with the instructions of the Director of Public Works. Failure or refusal by the right-of-way
user to follow such instructions shall constitute a violation of this section.
(4) Any trenches or excavations opened by a right-of-way user in the City right-of-way shall be

opened, disturbed or damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced with like materials at the expense of
the right-of-way user and left in as good a condition as before the opening, disturbance or damage occurred.
In the event that like materials for replacement are not available, the Director of Public Works may approve
the use of an alternative material that is reasonably close in effect to the original material. The Director of
Public Works will consider and evaluate for approved use, on a case by case basis, such alternative
methods that meet standards of good engineering practice.
(6) Where a cut or disturbance is made by a right-of-way user to a section of a street or a
sidewalk paving, rather than replacing only the area cut, the right-of-way user shall replace the full width of
the existing sidewalk or street paving and the full length of the section or sections cut, a section being that
area marked by expansion joints or scoring, or as directed by the City.

(8) No right-of-way user or any person acting on the right-of-way user=s behalf shall commence any
non-emergency work in the City right-of-way without five (5) working days advance notice to the City. In the
event of an emergency involving public safety, the public works Director or designee may issue the permit orally,
but the written documentation of the application for and issuance of the permit shall be completed as soon as
practicable after the work has started.
(9) Whenever any existing electric utility facilities, cable television facilities, or other telecommunications

also locate its facilities underground in that segment of the City right-of-way.
(10) Street crossings and sidewalk crossings by right-of-way user facilities shall be bored at those locations
where reasonably required by the Director of Public Works. Some examples of where such boring may be required
are: major streets, new streets, and locations of major events that conflict with construction.

unless the right-of-way user has filed with the City a registration statement in accordance with Section 22A.2 above.
(12) No permit for installation of right-of-way user facilities in the City right-of-way shall be issued by the
City Director of Public Works unless the right-of-way user has paid such installation permit fee as shall be
established from time to time by resolution of the City Council.

granted for good cause due to circumstances beyond the control of the right-of-way user.
Sec. 22A.5. AS BUILT DRAWINGS.
A right-of-way user shall, within sixty (60) days of making an installation of facilities in the City

construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any city public improvement, or for the operations of the City in
Sup #14/1995 Code 22A-4 Rev. 1-1-99
or upon the City right-of-way.
Sec. 22A.8. REMOVAL OF UNAUTHORIZED FACILITIES.

All installation work and activities for right-of-way user facilities in the City right-of-way shall be in
accordance with the installation permit issued by the Director of Public Works. Any work done that is not in
accordance with an applicable installation permit shall be a violation of this section by the right-of-way user; and,
failure to do work required by an installation permit shall be a violation by the right-of-way user, regardless of
involvement of agents or contractors of the right-of-way user.
Sec. 22A.10. EMERGENCY REMOVAL OR RELOCATION.
The City shall have the right and power to cut or move any right-of-way facilities in the City right-of-way as
the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency.
The City shall endeavor to give notice of such emergency disruption, but nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
create a duty to give such notice. Restoration of right-of-way facilities that have been cut or moved as aforesaid
shall be done by the right-of-way user at its own expense.
Sec. 22A.11. COORDINATION OF INSTALLATIONS.
All right-of-way users with facilities in the City right-of-way or who expect to install facilities in the City
right-of-way shall coordinate such activities with the City and with each other right-of-way user. Between January
1 and February 1 of each year, all registered right-of-way users shall provide to the City a schedule of their
anticipated installations in the City right-of way for that calendar year. Each registered right-of-way user shall
meet with the City, and with the other registered right-of-way users as scheduled by the City Director of Public
Works, to schedule and coordinate installation of right-of-way user facilities in the City right-of-way, so as to
minimize public inconvenience and costs.
Sec. 22A.12. INSURANCE AND BOND REQUIREMENTS.
(1) A right-of-way user that has or expects to install facilities within the City right-of-way shall maintain
in effect such insurance as the City=s risk manager shall reasonably deem appropriate to the nature of the facilities

(2) The Director of Public Works may require performance security in an amount commensurate with
the scope of the work, to secure satisfactory installation in accordance with the installation permit, by means of an
irrevocable letter of credit in a form approved by the City Attorney, or by cash deposit.
Sec. 22A.13. POLE ATTACHMENTS.
(1) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a right-of-way user to attach its facilities
to the utility poles of the City of Ames municipal electric utility, or to the utility poles of any other
right-of-way user. Installation of right-of-way user facilities underground in the same places where other
right-of-way user facilities are attached to an existing set of utility poles shall be permitted.
(2) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to confer upon any right-of-way user any right or
entitlement to make any attachment to the utility poles of the City of Ames municipal electric utility or to
Sup #14/1995 Code 22A-5 Rev. 1-1-99
the utility poles of any other right-of-way user.
(3) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the City of Ames municipal electric
utility from requiring any right-of-way user to make a payment of a pole attachment fee and Amake ready@
charges for attachment of facilities to the utility poles of the City of Ames municipal electric utility; and, to
enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of a pole attachment agreement.
(4) At those locations on the City right-of-way where there are already existing utility poles of
either the City of Ames municipal electric utility or of some other right-of-way user, a second set of poles
is strictly prohibited, except when done by or at the request of the City. If there is not sufficient space on
the existing utility poles for attachment of the proposed additional right-of-way user facilities, or if the
right-of-way user proposing to install right-of-way user facilities at the site of the existing poles cannot
reach an agreement with the owner of the poles to allow attachment of those facilities, then those facilities
shall be installed underground.
Sec. 22A.14. APPEAL TO CITY COUNCIL.
A right-of-way user that is denied registration, denied a right-of-way installation permit, that has its
right-of-way installation permit revoked, or that believes that the fees imposed do not conform to the
requirements of Chapter 480A, Code of Iowa, may request in writing that such denial, revocation or fee
imposition be reviewed by the City Council. The City Council shall act within sixty (60) days of a timely
written request. A decision by the City Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition must
be in writing and supported by a written finding establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
Sec. 22A.15. NO EASEMENT, PERMISSION ONLY, NOT ASSIGNABLE.
The provisions of this chapter, and the permits and authorizations granted pursuant to this chapter,
shall not be deemed to create or grant to anyone any easement, estate, or interest in the property of the City.
A permit to install right-of-way user facilities in the City right-of-way is a mere license, that is, an
authorization to the stated entity to go onto the land of the City to do only that which is explicitly stated by
the permit, that may be revoked by the City as provided in this chapter, and that cannot be assigned to
another. A right-of-way user that occupies city right-of-way or makes an installation of facilities in the
City right-of-way on the basis of a purported assignment of an installation permit granted to another entity,
shall be in violation of this section.
Sec. 22A.16. FRANCHISE FEE CREDIT.
For a right-of-way user that pays a franchise fee, the amount of any registration fee paid per
subsection 22A.2(2) and any installation permit fee paid per subsection 22A.3(13) shall be applied as a
credit to reduce the amount due for the franchise fee.

(1) If infrastructure required under Section 5.118 is not present or is not in a satisfactory condition, as

improvements have been installed, inspected, and accepted by the City and/or rights-of-way have been dedicated.

to be replaced. If City plans indicate that a shared use path is required, the sidewalk shall be replaced with a shared use
path.
(3) In addition to the above requirements, these specific exceptions apply to sidewalk and shared use
paths for projects in industrial zones:
(a) In areas zoned industrial on both sides of the street, a sidewalk or shared use path shall be
installed consistent with an approved sidewalk installation agreement.

agreement and where the adjacent lots have no sidewalk or shared use path, a sidewalk or shared use path shall be
installed on the north side of east/west streets or the east side of north/south streets. If conditions exist that would impact
the placement of a sidewalk or shared use path, such as topography, width of right-of-way, or proposed future road
improvements, the Public Works Director or designee may approve an alternative location.
(d) In areas zoned industrial and the other side of the street is zoned other than industrial, a
sidewalk or shared use path shall be installed whether or not the non-industrial zoned side has a sidewalk or shared use
path.
(4) If it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director or designee that there is
significant hardship for the installation of required infrastructure, the Public Works Director or designee may approve an
alternative improvement schedule.
(a) Significant hardship is presumptively demonstrated when the construction costs for the
required infrastructure equal or exceed 20 percent of the permit valuation.
(b) In the event that significant hardship is determined, improvements shall still be required and
will be based on the stated preference for installation, provided that the construction costs do not equal or exceed 20
percent of the permit valuation. Once the 20 percent threshold is reached, any additional required infrastructure may be
waived by the Public Works Director or designee.

ii. Shared-use paths.
iii. Sidewalks.
iv. Street lights.

discretion of the Public Works Director or designee. All improvements must meet SUDAS requirements as referenced in
Chapter 23.
(e) Significant hardship can be demonstrated only for additions or substantial improvements to
existing principle buildings. The cost of site work and building permit valuation shall be considered in review of
hardships for building additions. New principle buildings shall meet all installation requirements.
(5) Deferral Options. In limited circumstances a building permit may be issued without completion of the
final infrastructure improvements if one of the following infrastructure-deferral options is approved by the Public Works
Director:
(a) Three-year temporary deferral with financial security. A developer may provide financial
security in the form of cash, letter of credit, or bond for the missing infrastructure, and be allowed to defer
implementation for up to three years with approval of the Public Works Director. This option is only available when

(b) To provide for a balance between the use rights of individual landowners and the
economic, social, and environmental concerns of the public when the City is developing or enforcing its land use
regulations; and
(c) To encourage orderly development of the City and provide for the regulation and control
of the extension of public improvements, public services, and utilities, the improvement of land, and the design of
subdivisions, that, are consistent with the City's Land Use Policy Plan and other specific community plans.
(2) Application.
(a) The provisions of the Regulations are minimum requirements for promotion of the public
health, safety, and general welfare. No zoning permit or building permit shall be issued for construction,
enlargement, or expansion of a principal building, within the meaning of the City’s zoning regulations, from the
effective date of the Regulations with respect to any land that has been divided without compliance with the
provisions of the Regulations and all other applicable state laws and city ordinances in force at the time of such
division. If the Regulations impose higher standards than are required in any other statute or local ordinance or
regulation, the Regulations shall govern. If any other statute or local ordinance or regulation imposes higher
standards than are required by the Regulations, the other statute or local ordinance or regulation shall govern.
(Ord. No. 4025, 3-2-10)
(b) These Regulations govern any subdivision plats or plats of survey for divisions or subdivisions
inside the City's boundaries or outside the City's boundaries but within two miles of the City's boundaries

Sec. 23.103. WAIVER/MODIFICATION.
(1) Where, in the case of a particular subdivision, it can be shown that strict compliance with the
requirements of the Regulations would result in extraordinary hardship to the Applicant or would prove inconsistent
with the purpose of the Regulations because of unusual topography or other conditions, the City Council may
modify or waive the requirements of the Regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
Sup #2016-3 23-3 Rev. 07-1-16
secured provided, however, that such modification or waiver shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and
purpose of the Regulations. In no case shall any modification or waiver be more than necessary to eliminate the
hardship or conform to the purpose of the Regulations. In so granting a modification or waiver, the City Council
may impose such additional conditions as are necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the requirements so
modified or waived.
(2) The requirements of the Regulations for the platting of a Minor Subdivision may be waived by
city staff when it is determined by city staff that:
(a) A clear and accurate description of the area of land will be provided by means of a plat of
survey to be procured by the property owner, and in compliance with Section 23.307.
(b) With respect to that area of land, all substantive requirements and standards of the
Regulations are already met.

adjustment.
(2) The boundary line adjustment may be created by plat of survey or through the minor subdivision
process, as regulated by this chapter. If the adjustment is created by plat of survey, then only the newly created
parcel lines shall be recognized for permitting purposes; not the original lot lines. If the minor subdivision option is
used, then the original lot lines are eliminated.
(3) No public improvements shall be required in association with a boundary line adjustment unless
the adjustment increases the street frontage of the original lot or parcel that currently has frontage improvements, in
which case existing frontage improvements, which may include curbs, gutters, sidewalks, paths, street trees and/or

office at least 7 days prior to recording. The County Recorder may accept for recording any plat of survey that is
clearly titled “Plat of Retracement Survey” without a certificate of resolution from the City. However, plats of
retracement surveys shall not be recognized descriptions of official lots or parcels for permitting purposes. Only the
original survey or plat of a lot or parcel approved by the applicable governing body shall be used for permitting
purposes. If the retracement survey lines differ from the lot or parcel lines originally approved by the governing
body, and if the proprietors of record wish to have the retracement lines recognized as the official lot or parcel lines
for permitting purposes, they must submit application for a boundary line adjustment as defined in Section 23.308 of
this Chapter. If the lot or parcel line difference is the result of an error in the original survey, the surveyor or
proprietor may pursue correction of the error as provided in Section 23.310 of this Chapter.

DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
Sec. 23.401. SITE DESIGN STANDARDS.
(1) General: The design standards contained in these Regulations are the minimum requirements
applicable to a wide variety of circumstances for the general arrangement and layout of subdivisions. More
stringent standards may be appropriate when the City Council finds and concludes that site conditions so require in
order to ensure development of an economical, pleasant, and durable neighborhood. More stringent standards may
be required so long as such findings and conclusions demonstrate the consistency and compatibility of the standards
with applicable elements of the Land Use Policy Plan, the Urban Standard Specifications for Public Improvements,
the City of Ames Supplemental Urban Design Standards Manual, and other City plans and with the following
specific considerations:
(a) safe and convenient pedestrian and vehicular access to the subdivision;
(b) appropriate preservation and integration of natural features within the subdivision;
(c) the capacity and capability of infrastructure facilities, utility service and community
facility service; and
(d) minimizing overall lengths of public ways and infrastructure facilities while limiting the
use of dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs.

contemplated and shall conform as nearly as practicable to the size of existing and abutting blocks within the City's
jurisdiction so that any new public way shall extend the existing system of public ways, so that the preferred block
length does not exceed 600 feet and in no case shall a new block be longer than 1,320 feet or shorter than 280 feet
between center lines of public ways unless topography or other conditions justifies variation. Blocks shall have
sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots sufficient for the building needs of the use proposed and to satisfy
applicable zoning requirements. One tier of such lots shall be permitted for blocks adjacent to arterial streets,
railroads, or waterways.
(3) Lots: Any lot created by subdivision shall be appropriate for the type of development and use
contemplated and shall meet any applicable zoning requirements and the following additional standards:
(a) a lot at the corner or intersection of two public ways shall be of such width to permit
appropriate building setback and orientation to both public ways, as well as to provide adequate vehicular sight
clearance;
(b) a lot with double frontage or reverse frontage shall not be permitted in residential zones,
except where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterial streets or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation;
(Ord. No. 4092, 11-01-11)
(c) a lot shall be provided with a usable access to a public way, except that access on an
arterial street shall not be permitted unless alternative arrangements are impractical or impossible in which instance
a frontage road, a cul-de-sac, or some other means of alternative access may be required in order to limit possible
traffic hazard on such street;
(d) a lot should have side lot lines that are substantially at right angles to straight street lines
or radial to curved street lines;
(e) a lot shall have adequate depth and width for any proposed structure, off-street service,
and parking facilities required by the type of development and use contemplated;
Sup #2016-3 23-19 Rev. 07-1-16
(f) a lot created by subdivision that is larger than required under applicable zoning
requirements or other relevant building restrictions shall be arranged along with any other such lots created by
subdivision to allow the opening of future public ways. Any further subdivision and dedications or reservations
providing for such opening or extension of public ways may be made a requirement of the approval of a final plat to
the extent allowed by law; and
(g) an area of land created by subdivision that is unbuildable due to its location, size, shape,
or intended use, shall be labeled "outlot" on the final subdivision plat, the approval of which shall thereby restrict it
as an unbuildable area.
(h) In the instance that a school district boundary line is present, lots shall be created with lot
lines consistent with the school district boundary lines so that no lots are divided by a school district boundary line.
(Ord. No. 3767, 05-25-04)
(4) Conformance to Natural Features: As a means to protect the health, safety and welfare, no land
shall be subdivided into buildable lots which is unsuitable for development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep
slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, or other natural features. The developer may
formulate adequate methods to avoid, minimize or mitigate any problems reasonably expected from subdivision or
development of such land. Upon review of methods taken to avoid, mitigate or minimize any such problems the
Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Council may approve of such subdivision.
(5) Monumentation: Monuments shall meet all requirements specified by statute and shall be placed
within the area subdivided as follows: 5/8-inch iron re-rod or pipe monuments not less than thirty inches in length
shall be placed at each corner of any block, each end of any curve, and each angle or change in direction along any
boundary line and ½-inch iron re-rod or pipe not less than 30 inches in length shall be placed at each individual lot
angle point. Any monument shall have a cap of inert material affixed to the top, shall bear a cut marking of the Iowa
registration number of the land surveyor, and shall be driven to or below ground level to a depth of not more than six
inches. Monumentation shall occur prior to the submittal of the Final Plat as required in Section 23.302(8).
(6) Subdivision Name: The proposed name of any subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely
approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision in the county. The City Council shall have the final

Sec. 23. 402. RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISION LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.
General: As a requirement of subdivision approval for all subdivisions zoned residentially, trees shall be
planted within the right-of-way of all streets proposed within the subdivision. Trees shall be planted in accordance
to the requirements of this Section.
(1) Tree Species: Trees planted in the public-right-way shall be of a species as approved by the
Department of Public Works from the list of approved tree species for the City.
(2) Spacing: Trees shall be planted no closer than the distance of the full spread of the tree to the next
adjacent tree according to the species selected. Generally trees shall be planted at 30 to 50 feet spacing on center.
This spacing may be adjusted as a result of drive openings, underground utility services, street light placement, and
other potential obstructions.
(3) Area Requirement Per Tree: A minimum of nine square feet of area shall be maintained for each
tree and no impervious material shall be installed closer than 30 inches to the trunk of the tree.
(4) Placement: Trees shall not be located closer than 2-1/2 feet to the back of curb or the sidewalk
line. Where the distance between the back of curb and the sidewalk line is 8 feet, tree shall be centered in the space.
Where the distance between the back of curb and the sidewalk line is greater than 8 feet, trees shall be planted
within 4 feet of the sidewalk line.
(5) Location at Intersections: Trees shall not be planted closer than 30 feet from the corner at
intersections and shall not be closer than 20 feet to the intersection of the front and side lot line on a corner lot.
(6) Location From Driveways: Trees shall not be located closer to driveways than specified herein:
(a) Residential driveways - 10 feet
(b) Commercial driveways - determined on a case by case basis

Sec. 23.403. STREETS.
(1) General: The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform
with the City's arterial street map, these Regulations, and any further plans adopted by the City Council.
(2) Installation:
(a) Any subdivision for which a public street is necessary requires the installation of such
street including curbs and gutters adequate to serve all lots or parcels of land within the area to be subdivided.
Streets shall be installed with due regard to the present and foreseeable needs of the area to be subdivided and to the
location and capacity of existing streets. Streets shall be installed at the subdivider’s expense and be constructed
according to requirements of the City under the supervision of the Department of Public Works.
(b) Any such street shall become the property of the City, upon the City's inspection,
approval, and acceptance of such street, after the subdivider pays to the City any costs associated with its installation
including any reasonable charge for any supervisory or other services provided by the City.
(3) Wider Streets: A street may be required to be installed that is wider than necessary to meet the
needs of the area to be subdivided but is of a size necessary to complete the city arterial street system. The City may
pay any portion of the cost in materials or labor that exceeds the cost that is attributable to the installation of a street
of sufficient width to meet the needs of the area to be subdivided in accordance with the established Capital
Investment Strategy of the City.
(4) Relation to Existing Streets and Natural Features: Any collector or arterial street shall continue
the alignment and width of any such street on any abutting area when such continuation is necessary for convenient
movement of traffic, effective fire protection, and for efficient provision of utilities. Any other street shall conform
as much as possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility
systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
(5) Street Intersections: Any street shall be designed so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles with any existing or proposed street except where topography or other conditions justify variation. Any street
jog shall have a centerline off-set of no less than 280 feet except where topography or other conditions justify
variation.
(6) Street Grades: Any street shall be graded and improved to conform to applicable standards and
specifications and shall be approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer and shall be arranged so as
Sup #2016-3 23-21 Rev. 07-1-16
to provide the maximum number of lots at or above the grade of any street. A combination of steep grades and
curves shall be avoided.
(7) Dead end streets: Dead end streets shall not be permitted to be longer than 150 feet (as measured
from the closest edge of the perpendicular street’s driving lane) without a turnaround complying with minimum fire
code and SUDAS standards, except under the following circumstances:
(a) The dead end street is planned to continue and ultimately to provide access to a future
adjacent phase of the subdivision. In this case, a temporary turnaround shall be provided in compliance with all fire
code requirements. The preferred location for this turnaround is in public right of way, however, a fire apparatus
access easement may be provided for the turnaround outside of the public right of way, if in conformance with all of
the following:
(i) When the easement will be on land owned by the owner of the land being
platted, a notation shall be made on the preliminary plat indicating that a fire apparatus turnaround will be provided
outside the public right of way and the notation will specifically indicate whether the easement will be within the
area being platted or outside the area shown on the plat; and the location of easement shall be marked and identified
on the final plat and a separate instrument creating the easement shall be recorded contemporaneously with final plat
approval; or
(ii) If the easement is to be located on land outside the bounds of the area being
platted and the planned location is not owned by the owner of the land being platted, then a separate instrument
creating the easement shall be recorded prior to preliminary plat approval; or prior to commencement of excavation
or construction of public improvements.
and
(ii) The City of Ames shall be a named grantee in the easement, and the easement
language shall provide that the easement will expire upon final plat approval of a plat that extends said road into a
future phase or abutting subdivision.
(b) The dead end street is an anticipated extension beyond the bounds of the subdivision plat.
In this case, there shall be no structures fronting on the dead end street, and there shall be no lots having primary
access on the dead end street, beyond the first 150 feet of the street; or
(c) Alternative methods of compliance are approved by the fire code official as authorized
under Section 503 of the International Fire Code.
All required turnarounds for fire apparatus vehicles shall be posted “No Parking - Fire Lane” unless the turnaround
is wide enough to accommodate both curb parking and fire apparatus access.
(Ord. No. 4027, 3-23-10)
(8) Street Names: Any street that aligns and connects with any existing street shall bear the name of
such existing street. Any proposed name of any new streets shall not duplicate or sound similar to any existing
street name, and be conforming to the street naming policy of the City.
(9) Frontage and Access:
(a) Any subdivision shall have frontage on and access from an existing street meeting
applicable right-of-way standards. To the extent possible, access from a public-way to subdivisions from an arterial
street shall be separated by a minimum of 660 feet.
(b) Lots created by subdivision shall not have direct access to any arterial street, except in the
case where an existing platted lot had direct access to an arterial street prior to the adoption of these regulations and
the owner of such lot now seeks to resubdivide. A frontage road separated from an arterial street by a planting or
grass strip and having access to the arterial street at suitable points may be used as a means to provide access to lots
created by subdivision.
(c) Any subdivision shall have no less than two means of access whenever the length of any
street in the subdivision exceeds 1,320 feet or the average daily traffic is expected to exceed 750 vehicles.

required street width and right-of-way width.
(13) Street Lights: Street lights shall be installed along any streets within the subdivision and along
any abutting street frontage at intersections with streets within the subdivision.
Exception: For any final plat for which a preliminary plat has been approved prior to January 1, 2015, Street lights
shall be installed at the subdivider's expense and according to design and specification standards approved by the
City Council and after approval of the municipal utility.
(14) Sidewalks and Walkways:
(a) Sidewalks and walkways shall be designed to provide convenient access to all properties and
shall connect to the City-wide sidewalk system. A minimum of a five-foot wide concrete sidewalk shall be installed
in the public right-of-way along each side of any street in all zoning districts except General Industrial and Planned
Industrial. A minimum of a five-foot wide concrete sidewalk shall be installed in the public right-of-way along one
side of any street in the General Industrial and Planned Industrial zoning districts. If sidewalks on adjacent property
are greater than five feet, the subdivider shall install sidewalks to match. If constraints exist that preclude installation
of a sidewalk within the public right-of-way, the subdivider shall install the required sidewalk on adjacent land
within a sidewalk easement. All required sidewalks shall connect with any sidewalk within the area to be subdivided
and with any existing or proposed sidewalk in any adjacent area.
(b) Exception: For any final plat for which a preliminary plat has been approved prior to January
1, 2015, the following standard shall be met:
Sidewalks and walkways shall be designed to provide convenient access to all properties and shall connect to the
City-wide sidewalk system. A minimum of a four-foot wide concrete sidewalk shall be installed in the public rightof-
way along each side of any street within residentially and commercially zoned areas and along at least one side of
any street within industrially zoned areas. Such a sidewalk shall connect with any sidewalk within the area to be
subdivided and with any existing or proposed sidewalk in any adjacent area. Any required sidewalk shall be
constructed of concrete and be at least four feet wide.
(c) A deferment for the installation of sidewalks may be granted by the City Council when
topographic conditions exist that make the sidewalk installation difficult or when the installation of the sidewalk is
premature. Where the installation of a sidewalk is deferred by the City Council, an agreement will be executed
between the property owner/developer and the City of Ames that will ensure the future installation of the sidewalk.
The deferment agreement will be accompanied by a cash escrow, letter of credit, or other form of acceptable
financial security to cover the cost of the installation of the sidewalk.
(d) A pedestrian walkway made of concrete may be required where deemed essential to provide
access to schools, parks and playgrounds, commercial areas, transportation or community facilities. Any such
walkway shall be not less than eight feet wide.

developer to pay a connection fee in accordance with requirements of the City.
(2) New Water Supply: Any subdivision to which a public water main is not accessible requires the
installation at the subdivider's expense and subject to requirements of the City plans and specifications and under
the supervision of the Department of Public Works. The water main system to be installed shall include any water
mains and other water facilities adequate to serve all lots or areas of land within the area to be subdivided. Due
regard shall be given to the present and reasonably foreseeable needs of the area to be subdivided and to the location
and capacity of existing water mains and other water facilities. Any such water mains or other water facilities shall
become the property of the City, upon the City's inspection, approval, and acceptance of such mains and facilities,
after the subdivider pays to the City any costs associated with their installation including any reasonable charge for
any supervisory or other services provided by the City.
(3) Oversize Water Supply: A water main may be required to be installed that is larger than necessary
to meet the needs of the area to be subdivided but is of a size necessary to complete the City water distribution
system as it relates to both the area to be subdivided and other areas which may reasonably be anticipated to be
subdivided or otherwise developed or used. The City may pay any portion of the cost in materials or labor that
exceeds the cost that is attributable to the installation of a water main of sufficient size to meet the needs of the area
to be subdivided according to the Capital Investment Strategy of the City.

shall include any sanitary sewers and other sewage facilities adequate to serve all lots or areas of land within the
area to be subdivided. Due regard shall be given to the present and reasonably foreseeable needs of the area to be
subdivided and to the location and capacity of existing sanitary sewers and other sewage facilities. Any such
sanitary sewers or other sewage facilities shall become the property of the City, upon the City's inspection, approval,
and acceptance of such sewers and facilities, after the subdivider pays to the City any costs associated with their
installation including any reasonable charge for any supervisory or other services provided by the City.
(4) Oversize Sanitary Sewer:
(a) A sanitary sewer may be required to be installed that is larger than the minimum standard
size. When a larger sanitary sewer main is required because of grade, land use or circumstances created by the
development, these larger sanitary sewer mains shall be installed at the developer's expense.
(b) When a larger sanitary sewer main is required by the City, the cost of the installation of
the main will be the responsibility of the City unless lots within the subdivision have direct service connection to
this larger main. In that instance the cost of the larger main shall be shared by the City and the developer. The City
may pay any portion of the cost in materials that exceeds the cost that is attributable to the installation of a sanitary
sewer of sufficient size to meet the needs of the area to be subdivided according to the Capital Investment Strategy
of the City.

runoff including by storm water management measures necessary and appropriate for carrying away by pipe or
surface channelization any spring or surface water that may exist at the time of subdivision or be reasonably
expected to be created by development or use of the area to be subdivided.
(b) Any required storm sewers including foundation drain collector lines shall be separate
from any required sanitary sewers and shall be installed at the subdivider's expense and subject to requirements of
the City and shall be adequate to serve all lots or parcels of land within the area to be subdivided.
(c) The storm sewer system shall be designed with due regard to the present and reasonably
foreseeable needs of the area to be subdivided and to the location and capacity of existing storm sewers and other
storm water management measures available to serve existing and reasonably anticipated development or use of
areas abutting the area to be subdivided.
(d) Any such storm sewers may become the property of the City, upon the City's inspection,
approval, and acceptance of such sewers, after the subdivider pays to the City any costs associated with their
installation including any reasonable charge for any supervisory or other services provided by the City.

written protest in the office of the City Clerk for the City of Ames.

the tenth business day following the last date of publication, the deferral shall be final and in effect, unless or until
protested and denied by the Cable Television Commission as hereafter provided.

evidence showing that the grantee's projected costs of service are unreasonably high or that projected revenues are
unreasonably low, the Cable Commission shall, after notice and an opportunity for public hearing, approve or deny
the deferral of service.

shall be whether the grantee will realize a rate of return of not less than 12% after taxes as determined
by dividing projected gross receipts from customer services in the locale or place, less expenses, by the cost of

Sec. 28.108. OPTIONAL TIME-OF-USE (TOU) INDUSTRIAL ELECTRIC RATE AND CHARGES.
(1) Availability: The Industrial Time-of-Use (TOU) Electric Rate shall be voluntary for any
non-residential customer whose metered demand at any time exceeds 2,500 kVA. Service under this rate schedule is
billed on a Time-of-Use (TOU) basis as provided under these rules established by Electric Services. The Optional
Time-of-Use Industrial Electric Rate is an alternative to, and at the customer’s discretion replaces, Section 28.107 (1)
Sup #2019-3 28-9 Rev. 7-1-19
Availability. Customers opting for inclusion on the Optional Time-of-Use (TOU) Industrial Electric Rate are
required to remain on the rate for a period no less than twelve consecutive calendar months.
(Ord. No. 4130, 11-27-12)
(2) Intent: Electric Services is a summer peaking electric utility, and as such, the cost to deliver
electricity is generally most expensive and detrimental to generation and distribution systems during hours of greatest
demand. The utility, and the community of Ames, benefit when large electric users are encouraged to reduce their
demand during these times. A Time-of-Use (TOU) Rate is a pricing strategy whereby Electric Services may vary the
price of electricity depending on the time-of-day it is delivered to the customer. Prices encourage the customer to use
electricity during times of low demand and discourage use during the peak times of the day. Time-of-Use (TOU)
pricing allows Electric Services to better control costs and mitigate any negative system impacts related to times of
peak demand.
(3) Definitions:
(a) Time-of-Use (TOU): A specifically identifiable period of time during a twenty-four hour
day used for establishing a pricing strategy aimed at reducing the overall demand for electricity.
(b) Peak: The greatest fifteen (15) minute demand for electricity measured during the current
billing period.
(c) Billing Demand: Highest metered kilovolt-amp (kVA) electric use, in a billing period
measured between the hours of 3pm and 7 pm Monday through Thursday, over the billing period. If, however, a
higher kVA electric use is set during a required Interruption (see Section 28.108 (5) ), this will result in a Billing
Demand set outside of the Monday – Thursday window.
(d) Holidays: Federally observed Holidays.
(e) On-Peak Energy: Electricity, measured in kilowatt hours, used Monday through Friday
between the hours of 8:00 am and 8:00 pm.
(f) Off-Peak Base Energy: Electricity, measured in kilowatt hours, used Monday through
Friday between the hours of 8:00 pm and 8:00 am, and all day Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, up to the established
monthly Billing Demand.
(g) Off-Peak Time-of-Use Energy: Electricity, measured in kilowatt hours, used Monday
through Friday between the hours of 8:00 pm and 8:00 am, and all day Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, in excess of
the established monthly Billing Demand
(h) Summer period: Bills mailed on or between July 1 and October 31.
(i) Winter period: Bills mailed on or between November 1 and June 30.
(j) Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA): The Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA) is a billing
component that allows the utility to reflect fluctuations in the cost of fuel for the power plant without frequently
changing the standard energy charges. The ECA is simply the difference between actual fuel costs for the past twelve
months and the base fuel cost added to every metered kilowatt-hour (kWh).
(4) Rate Per Billing Period: For each monthly billing period, an Industrial customer participating in
the Optional Time-of-Use (TOU) Electric Rate shall be charged:
(a) the Service Charge of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
(b) the Demand Charge and the Energy Charge for the energy consumption during the billing
period as follows:
(i) for bills mailed on or between July 1 and October 31 (summer period):
1) the Billing Demand times the billing rate of $10.40 per kVA, and
2) the On Peak, Energy times the billing rate of $0.0644 per kWh,
3) the Off Peak, Base Energy times the billing rate of $0.0644 per kWh,
4) the Off Peak, Time-of-Use Energy times the billing rate of $0.04 per kWh,
(ii) for On-Peak bills mailed on or between November 1 and June 30 (winter period):
1) the Billing Demand times the billing rate of $7.80 per kVA, and
2) the On Peak, Energy times the billing rate of $0.0644 per kWh,
Sup #2019-3 28-10 Rev. 7-1-19
3) the Off Peak, Base Energy times the billing rate of $0.0644 per kWh,
4) the Off Peak, Time-of-Use Energy times the billing rate of $0.04 per kWh,
(Ord. No. 3955, 05-27-08; Ord 3987, 05-12-09; Ord. No. 4130, 11-27-12)
(c) the applicable Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA) per Sec. 28.102, and
(Ord. No. 4130, 11-27-12)
(d) any applicable bill impacts of Section 28.107 (3) Billing Demand, (4) Minimum Bill, (6)
Service Facilities, (7) Excess Facilities, (8) Primary Service, and (9) Conditions.
(5) Interruptible Option: For each summer monthly billing period, an Industrial customer
participating in the Optional Time-of-Use (TOU) Electric Rate may, at Electric Services’ discretion,
(a) on at least a 6 hour notice, be required to reduce demand to that equal to, the previous
Billing Demand two months prior at any time Monday at 8:00 am through Saturday before 8:00 pm,
(i) the actual demand during the interruption period will be used as the Billing
Demand for the month if it is higher than the highest metered kilovolt-amp (kVA) electric use, in a billing month
measured between the hours of 3 pm and 7 pm Monday through Thursday, over the billing period.
(b) the duration of the interruption will be up to 4 hours in length
(c) maximum number of occurrences per month (3)
(6) Noncompliance Penalty: If at any time during participation in the Optional Time-of-Use (TOU)
Electric Rate the customer’s On-Peak demand exceeds one hundred thirty (130) percent of their ninety (90) day rolling
average peak, the customer will be charged a penalty of $5 per kVA on the current billing period's billing demand.

system, the customer may at his option apply for and have installed a 'yard meter'.
(b) A 'yard meter' is defined as a second water meter or sub-meter on the premises installed
downstream of the first or master water meter. It will be so placed as to meter outdoor water use described above
which does not reach the sanitary sewer system. The 'yard meter' shall have a remote reading register outdoors as
required for the master water meter.
(c) The full cost of the 'yard meter' and any associated plumbing changes shall be the
responsibility of the customer. The 'yard meter' shall be furnished and owned by the City and so located as to be
easily accessible at all times. Maintenance and replacement of the 'yard meter' shall be governed by the same
requirements applying to all other water meters owned by the City.
(d) The sewer service charge will be billed only on the difference between the water meter
reading and the yard meter reading.
(Ord. No. 3326, Sec. 2, 5-9-95; Ord. No. 4199, 11-25-14; Ord. No. 4263, 6-28-16)
(9) Where a “yard meter” is not installed, but it appears in any month that more than one thousand
(1,000) cubic feet of water was used in a way that the water did not reach the sanitary sewer, that amount of water shall
be exempt from the sewer rate on application to the City Manager or the City Manager’s designee. The total
exemption allowed under this provision shall be granted over no more than two consecutive billing periods.
(Ord. No. 3950, 05-13-08; Ord. No. 4003, 08-11-09)

(2) Any costs for compliance with the regulations set forth in the FOG Control Program shall be the
responsibility of the customer.
(3) FSEs subject to the FOG Control Program may apply for exemption from the Restaurant
Surcharge/Restaurant Fee. Exemptions shall utilize evidence gathered in the preceding six (6) month period to
determine whether an FSE is exempt from the Restaurant Surcharge/Restaurant Fee for sewer bills mailed during the
following six (6) month period. Exemption periods shall be from January to June and from July to December.
(4) The use of any additive into a grease interceptor, grease trap, or other on-premise
plumbing for the purpose of “treating” FOG shall be prohibited unless prior approval is granted by the
Director of Water and Pollution Control.
(a) FSE’s who wish to use any additives must submit a request in writing. Each site wishing
to use a product must obtain separate approval. Approval is not granted to use any product unless and until written
approval is granted by the City.
Sup #2018-3 28-30 Rev. 7-1-18
(b) A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) must be submitted to the Director for approval of the product.
The SDS, or other information submitted, must identify all active and inactive ingredients of the products. Materials
that include “confidential” or “proprietary” components will not be approved.
(c) To be approved, products must be composed of non-emulsifying active biological
additives designed to decompose the grease in the grease trap or grease interceptor.
(i) Products that serve to simply “disperse” FOG, or that act by allowing FOG to be more
easily discharged from FOG control devices will not be approved.
(ii) Examples of products that are not approved are those that include, but are not limited
to, the following types of components:
(a) Enzymes
(b) Solvents
(c) Surfactants
(d) Dispersants
(e) Other products that act on grease “chemically” as opposed to “biologically”
(f) Other components that are deemed to be otherwise incompatible with the
purpose of the FOG Control Program or the municipal sewerage system as described in Section 28.306.
(d) Approval of a product may be revoked by the Director if pass-through of FOG or other
problems in the collection system of treatment plant occurs.
(e) Aeration, agitation, or stirring of grease traps or grease interceptors shall not occur at any
time.
(f) Approval of any additive shall not be construed as approval to modify any plumbing. Any
changes or modifications necessary shall be conditioned upon receipt of a plumbing permit from the City.
(g) Approval of any additive shall not be construed as an endorsement by the City of the
effectiveness of the product. The FSE assumes all responsibility for the performance and effectiveness of the
product.
(h) Servicing frequencies for grease control equipment must still comply with the other
requirements of this ordinance.
(i) Should the make-up or composition of any approved product change, a new approval must
be granted by the Director.
(5) The Director of Water and Pollution Control, or designee, may exempt an FSE from the Restaurant
Surcharge/Restaurant Fee for a six (6) month period if one of the following criteria is met during the preceding six (6)
month period:
(a) Submission of records of grease interceptor cleanings occurring in the previous six (6)
months. If a grease interceptor is not cleaned during the previous six (6) months, the reason(s) for this must be
submitted to and approved by the Director of Water and Pollution Control or designee. Such records shall include the
following information:
(i) The name and employer of the individual performing the grease interceptor
cleaning(s).
(ii) The date(s) on which grease was removed from each grease interceptor controlled
by the customer.
(iii) The quantity of grease removed during each cleaning.
(a) In the case of a gravity-flow grease interceptor, the quantity of grease
shall be calculated by comparing the depth of the floating fats, oils, and grease, plus the depth of the accumulated
solids, and dividing that depth by the total depth of the unit (the design liquid level), expressed as a percentage. The
measurements shall be taken in the compartment nearest the inlet of a multi-compartment grease interceptor and in the
interceptor immediately preceding connection to the sanitary sewer when more than one interceptor is installed in
series, and in all interceptors when more than once interceptor is installed in parallel. In instances where an interceptor
requires cleaning multiple times during the six (6) month review period, records shall be submitted for each cleanout.
The owner or operator of the FSE shall require the grease interceptor to be cleaned when FOG and solids reach 25% or
Sup #2018-3 28-31 Rev. 7-1-18
less of the design liquid level of the grease interceptor. When multiple cleanouts are required during a review period,
the level of FOG and solids from each cleanout shall average 25% or less and no single instance shall equal or exceed
35%.
(b) In the case of a hydromechanical grease interceptor, the quantity of
grease shall be calculated by comparing the depth of the floating fats, oils, and grease, plus the depth of the
accumulated solids, and dividing that depth by the total depth of the unit (the design liquid level), expressed as a
percentage. The measurements shall be taken in the compartment nearest the inlet of a multi-compartment grease
interceptor, in the interceptor immediately preceding connection to the sanitary sewer when more than one interceptor
is installed in series, and in all interceptors when more than once interceptor is installed in parallel. In instances where
an interceptor requires cleaning multiple times during the six (6) month review period, records shall be submitted for
each cleanout. The owner or operator of the FSE shall require the grease interceptor to be cleaned when FOG and
solids reach 25% or less of the design liquid level of the grease interceptor. When multiple cleanouts are required
during a review period, the level of FOG and solids from each cleanout shall average 25% or less and no single
instance shall equal or exceed 35%. In situations where a hydromechanical grease interceptor is not able to be
measured prior to cleanout, it shall be required that the interceptor be cleaned on a monthly basis.
(iv) Verification that the place of disposal of hauled grease is a facility designed for
such a purpose and is licensed or certified in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations, as appropriate.
(v) Verification that the method of transporting hauled grease is appropriate for such
a purpose and complies with local, state, and federal regulations, as appropriate.
(vi) Verification that any grease interceptor from which grease is removed is
inspected and found to be in proper working order. This inspection shall include verification that the sanitary “tees” on
the inlet and outlet sides of the grease interceptor are not obstructed, loose, or missing, verification that any baffles are
secure and in place, verification that no cracks or defects in the tank are present, and verification that lids are securely
and properly seated following completion of the cleaning. If any component of the grease interceptor is not in proper
working order, records shall indicate what defect(s) exist and when, how, and by whom such defect(s) are remedied.
(b) Submission of a laboratory test to determine the oil and grease content of typical
wastewater discharge. Such tests shall be conducted by a laboratory certified by the State of Iowa to test oil and grease
under the procedures specified in Chapter 567.83 of the Iowa Administrative Code. Laboratory tests shall conform to
the following conditions:
(i) The sample shall be obtained by use of a “grab sampling” method, in which the
sample flask is held under a free-flowing outfall of water from a sampling port designed for such uses.
(ii) Staff of the Water Pollution Control Department shall select the date and time
during which a sample may be obtained, the timing of which shall be selected to coincide with a peak customer
demand.
(iii) The sample shall not exceed 300 mg/L oil and grease.
(iv) The FSE shall also be required to meet the same requirements as defined in Sec.
28.308(5)(a).
(c) Submission of kitchen Best Management Practices records that detail the grease control
activities in the FSE. Such records shall be spot-checked for compliance by the Water and Pollution Control
Department staff. The records shall at all times be kept and maintained on a day-to-day basis, and records shall be kept
secure at the premises of the FSE for a continuous period of at least three years. The records shall document the
following activities:
(i) Each cleaning of the FSE’s grease interceptor(s). The FSE shall be required to
meet the same requirements as are defined in Sec. 28.308(5)(a).
(ii) Training held for the FSE’s staff regarding practices that will reduce the
introduction of FOG into the sanitary sewer.
(iii) Self-inspection for presence and proper use of drain screens, clean and grease-free
nature of exhaust hood equipment, and presence of spill clean-up kits, warning signage over sinks regarding FOG
practices, and informational posters regarding FOG.
Sup #2018-3 28-32 Rev. 7-1-18
(iv) Records of the date, time, quantity, and location of introduction of any additive.
A copy of the approval granted by the Water and Pollution Control Department shall be kept with the logbook.
(v) Any other activities undertaken by the FSE’s staff to prevent or mitigate the
introduction of FOG into the Treatment Works or into the environment.
(6) (a) Cleaning of a hydromechanical grease interceptor may be performed by food service
establishment staff. Documentation of any cleaning must include all information required for compliance with the
FOG Control Program.
(b) Cleaning of a gravity-flow grease interceptor must be performed by a contractor that
specializes in the disposal of restaurant grease.
(7) The Director of Water and Pollution Control may, upon finding evidence of accumulated FOG in
the Treatment Works, authorize an inspection of any FSE that may reasonably be believed to have introduced that
accumulation of FOG. Such inspection may occur at any reasonable time and without prior notification. Inspections
shall be limited to the equipment and practices related to the introduction of FOG and waste water into the Treatment
Works. The FSE shall allow the individual performing this inspection, bearing proper credentials and identification, to
enter upon or into the building, facility, or property housing the FSE for the purpose of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, testing, or record review. Upon request of the individual performing the inspection, the FSE
shall open any grease interceptor for the purpose of confirming that maintenance frequency is appropriate, that all
necessary parts of the installation are in place, and that all grease interceptors and related equipment and piping are
maintained in efficient operating condition. Inspections may be undertaken as many times as necessary to identify the
source of FOG entering the Treatment Works.

enforcement employee and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
(e) Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized city enforcement employee access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this section. A person who is the operator of
a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the authorized city enforcement employee reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this ordinance.

sampling program designed to verify compliance with this section or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized city enforcement employee may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(9) Use of Best Management Practice. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed best management practices. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

within the established deadline, the work may be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator, and the costs paid by the violator within the time specified. Failure

Section 31.10. CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
(1) Any act of alteration, demolition, new construction, or relocation, as defined herein, shall require a
Certificate of Appropriateness as further described below.
Furthermore, every application for a building permit or a demolition permit affecting the exterior architectural
appearance of a designated landmark or of any contributing structure within a designated historic district shall be
accompanied by an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness. Applicants shall be required to submit plans,
drawings, elevations, specifications, and other information as may be necessary to make decisions. The Building
Official shall not issue the building or demolition permit until a Certificate of Appropriateness has been approved.
(2) Alteration of an exterior part of a building or a structure. An alteration is any act or process that
changes one or more of the exterior features of a structure, without increasing the amount of gross floor area.
Alterations to existing structures that are contributing structures or to structures designated as historic landmarks
shall require a Certificate of Appropriateness and shall be permitted in the following instances.
(a) An architectural feature has deteriorated to the point that it must be replaced.
(b) Architectural features were added which modified the original qualities of the
architectural style and the current property owner wishes to restore the structure to the original architectural style.

designated landmark.
A new principal structure shall be representative of one of the architectural styles approved in the district
The design for the new principal structure must meet all the design criteria listed for the architectural style selected.
Architectural features not specifically listed in the design criteria may be proposed by the applicant. Those features
should be incorporated in a manner appropriate with the architectural style.
(4) Consideration of an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall apply the Design
Guidelines, which shall pertain to all historic preservation districts and historic landmarks; and the Design Criteria,
which shall apply only to the particular historic district or historic landmark for which they are enacted.
In each instance the Commission may grant exemptions to the requirements for an alteration if it
determines that the cost of replication is prohibitive.
Sup. 2015-2 31-6 Rev. 04-01-15
(5) Demolition. Demolition of existing principal structures that are contributing structures or of a
historic landmark shall be strictly prohibited except in the following instance:
The structure cannot be used for the original intended purpose and/or no alternative reasonable use can be identified
and the property owner can show evidence that an economic hardship will be created if the structure cannot be
removed. To prove economic hardship, the applicant may submit where appropriate to the applicant's proposal, the
following information to be considered.
(a) Estimate of the cost of the proposed demolition, and an estimate of any additional cost
that would be incurred to comply with the recommendations of the Commission for changes necessary for the
issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness.
(b) A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in rehabilitation as to the
structural soundness of the structures or structures on the property and their suitability for rehabilitation. (This shall
be required only when the applicant's proposal is based on an argument of structural soundness.)

demolition; after any changes recommended by the Commission; and after renovation of the existing property for
continued use.
(d) An estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other real
estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the
existing structure on the property.
(e) Amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the party from whom purchased,
including a description of the relationship, if any, between the owner of record or applicant and the person from
whom the property was purchased, and any terms of financing between the seller and buyer.

Determination of Economic Hardship. The Commission shall review all the evidence and information
required of an applicant and make a determination whether the denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness has
deprived, or will deprive, the owner of the property of reasonable use of, or economic return on, the property. After
reviewing the evidence, the Commission may deny the application, may approve a Certificate of Appropriateness for
Demolition, or may table the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition for a period of time not
to exceed 30 days. The 30 day period will permit an opportunity for other alternatives to be evaluated. If a suitable
alternative is not presented to the Commission within the 30 day period, the Certificate of Appropriateness for
Demolition shall be approved.
In no instance will the Commission approve a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition without
approval of a redevelopment project and submittal by the applicant of a bond or cash escrow to guarantee
completion of the approved project.
(6) Demolition of Contributing Garages.
No contributing garage structure may be demolished without first receiving approval by the Commission. The
Commission may permit the demolition of a contributing garage structure only after considering the following
factors and determining that either the garage is not a contributing garage or it is not practicable to be retained on
site.
Sup. 2015-2 31-7 Rev. 04-01-15
(a) Historical Significance. The Commission shall determine whether the garage contributes
to the historic character of the house, or district, based upon historical and architectural research.
(b) Architectural Integrity. The Commission will consider if the architectural design of the
structure has been altered and/or sufficient historic material has been removed in such a way that it compromises the
overall integrity of the building. This may include a combination of the following:
(i) Removal or alteration of original door and/or window openings;
(ii) Removal or alteration of original garage/barn/pedestrian doors;
(iii) Installation of artificial siding;
(iv) Alteration of the original building footprint and/or roofline; and
(v) Loss of original materials due to removal and/or deterioration.
(c) Functionality. The Commission will consider whether or not the structure can be put to
any reasonable use. For example, a historic one-car garage may be too small to accommodate a modern-day vehicle,
but may still function as a place for storage.
(d) Structural Condition. The Commission will consider if one or more significant structural
problems exist and whether or not rehabilitation of that structure would result in most of the historic materials being
replaced, resulting in essentially a new building. When assessing structural condition, the following factors may be
considered:
(i) Quality of original construction;
(ii) Bowing walls;
(iii) Lack of a foundation;
(iv) Extensive siding repair;
(v) Termite damage;
(vi) Rotted wood; and
(vii) Integrity of roof system.
(e) Location on the Property. The Commission may consider the building’s location on the
property and whether or not it is visible from the public street, or alley, when assessing the impact that demolition
will have on a historic district. However, location alone typically does not justify demolition. If the contributing
garage is insufficient in size for modern-day vehicles, efforts should be made to construct a new garage on another
portion of the site, to accommodate the vehicles.
(7) Relocation. Relocation of a historic landmark or of an existing contributing structure within or into
a historic district shall be strictly prohibited except in the following instances:
(a) The structure is being relocated to its original site of construction.
(b) Relocation of the structure is an alternative to demolition of the structure.
(c) A structure to be moved within or into the district is of an architectural style identified in
that district. The structure can be relocated to a vacant parcel or to a parcel occupied by a noncontributing structure
which will be removed.
(8) Ordinary Maintenance Permitted; Public Safety.
(a) Ordinary Maintenance Permitted. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent
the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior feature in a historic district or of any historic landmark which do
not involve alterations or changes in the exterior features of a building. For the purposes of this Ordinance, changes
made in the color of the exterior surfaces of a building are considered to be ordinary maintenance and repair.
(b) Public Safety. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the construction, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, or demolition of any interior or exterior feature which the City Building Official shall certify
is required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition, but any such action shall be, where
possible, in accordance with the design guidelines and design criteria set forth in Section 31.13 (Design Guidelines
for Alterations) and in Section 31.14 (Design Criteria).
Section 31.11. APPLICATION FOR A CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
(1) Administrative Approval Process.
(a) A Certificate of Appropriateness for alterations to the principal structure, garages, and
other accessory buildings, and the new construction of fences and retaining walls can be approved by the Planning
Sup. 2015-2 31-8 Rev. 04-01-15
and Housing Director, provided the alterations or new construction meet the adopted Design Guidelines and Design
Criteria, and substitute materials are not proposed, other than those specifically listed in the Design Guidelines. The
Planning and Housing Director may refer an application for an alteration to the Commission for approval.
(b) Administrative Approval Procedure. Upon receipt of a fully completed application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness, the application materials will be reviewed by staff of the Department of Planning and
Housing. The application for a Certificate of Appropriateness may be:

(ii) Approved with modifications;
(iii) Denied; or
(iv) Referred to the Commission.
(c) Applications which have not received final administrative approval within thirty (30)
days from the date of acceptance of the application, due to any unresolved dispute as to the administrative
interpretation of this Chapter shall be submitted in its entirety to the Commission for their approval.
(2) Historic Preservation Commission Approval Process.
(a) Applications. The Commission shall review the application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness and approve or deny the application, except as provided for in Section 31.11(1).
(b) Approval/Denial. Written notice of the approval or denial of the application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall be provided by the Department of Planning and Housing to the applicant and the
Building Official within seven (7) days following the determination and shall be accompanied by a Certificate of
Appropriateness in the case of an approval.
(c) Denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness. A denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the denial. The Commission shall make recommendations to
the applicant concerning changes, if any, in the proposed action that would cause the Commission to reconsider its
denial and shall confer with the applicant and attempt to resolve as quickly as possible the differences between the
owner and the Commission. The applicant may resubmit an amended application or reapply for a building or
demolition permit that takes into consideration the recommendations of the Commission.
(d) Subsequent Applications. All structures that have once obtained a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be required to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness for all subsequent alterations, new
construction, or demolition.
(3) Other Codes, Regulations, and Ordinances. In granting or denying a Certificate of
Appropriateness, the Commission shall not have the power to override housing codes, zoning regulations, or any
other Ordinances of the City.
(4) Building Permit. Upon issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness, the applicant may apply for a
building permit, if required and not already submitted.
(5) Effective Period of Approval for a Certificate of Appropriateness. The approval of any application
for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be effective for one (1) year from the date of approval by the Commission,
or by the Department of Planning and Housing (in the case of administrative approvals). The Planning and Housing
Director may approve a 1 year extension upon finding that the pertinent codes have not changed since the original
approval.
Sec. 31.12. THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR’S STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION.
The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation from the U.S. Department of the Interior,
National Park Service, shall be followed. The standards described below are to be applied to specific rehabilitation
projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility:
(1) A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal
change to the defining characteristic of the building and its site and environment.
(2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
(3) Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that

textures, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
(7) Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
(8) Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
(9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials
that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
(10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be
unimpaired.
Sec. 31.13. DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR ALTERATIONS.
(1) Use of Substitute Materials. Historic materials shall be used unless otherwise excepted. The
Design Guidelines include specific substitute materials for some building elements that are approved as an
acceptable alternative to the historic materials for alterations for those building elements. Other substitute materials
not listed may be used only if the Commission determines that all of the following conditions are met:
(a) the historic material on the structure is so deteriorated or damaged that it cannot be
repaired; and
(b) the historic material on the structure is not readily available; and
I the substitute material can be installed without irreversibly damaging or obscuring the

permitted when no reasonable alternative exists.
(d) Masonry and concrete foundations which were never painted shall not be painted.
(e) Historic brick, stone, and rusticated masonry foundations shall not be coated with cement
plaster or stucco where exposed above grade.
(8) Garages and Accessory Buildings
(a) Garages shall be retained, whenever possible. Demolition is allowed only if it is
determined by the Commission that the adopted criteria for demolition of a contributing garage are met.
(b) Retain and preserve the character-defining materials, features, and details of historic
garages, including foundations, roofs, siding, masonry, windows, doors, and architectural trim, in accordance with

APPENDIX A
AMES MUNICIPAL CEMETERY RULES AND REGULATIONS
Persons desiring to purchase rights to interment in a lot, space, or columbarium niche in a city cemetery are
referred to the Cemetery Superintendent for assistance. Once a selection is made, the superintendent will issue a
report to the Finance Office of the City of Ames, where an invoice will be prepared. Upon receipt of payment and a
signed agreement of interment rights from the purchaser(s), the superintendent’s report will be forwarded to the City
Clerk, who will then issue a certificate of rights for the lot or columbarium niche.
The terms "Lot Owner" or "Ownership" shall be construed to mean the right to use a lot, space, or part of
lot or columbarium niche, as purchased from the City for a consideration, for burial purposes only and under the
existing or subsequent rules and regulations as prescribed by the City for such use. The term “Lot” shall include a
columbarium niche, unless expressly stated otherwise. The terms “burial” or “interment” shall include use of a
columbarium niche, unless expressly stated otherwise.
Upon full payment of the purchase price, the City will issue a Cemetery certificate of rights under its seal
that will be recorded in the records of the City as evidence of ownership of rights to interment in the lot or
columbarium niche. Lots or spaces for which deeds or certificates of interment rights have been issued by the City
will not thereafter be divided except by consent of the Cemetery Superintendent. All lots are exempt from taxation
and cannot be seized for debts, (except those owed to the cemetery), nor can they be mortgaged.
The City shall have the right to assume at all times that the lot owner acquired rights to a lot for the
interment of the owner and members of the owner's family. Unless otherwise directed in writing by the owner in a
document filed with the City Clerk, the cemetery will permit the interment of members of the owner's family at the
request of any interested person upon proof of eligibility for burial, as follows:
(a) The surviving spouse of the lot owner shall have the first right to interment or to direct the right of
interment.
(b) When there is no surviving spouse, seventy-five percent (75%) of the known heirs of the deceased lot
owner, or, if the lot is devised under a will of the deceased lot owner, seventy-five percent (75%) of the devisees
may, by written agreement, determine who shall have the right of interment or power to direct interment in said lot.
Heirs or devisees shall provide evidence of such agreement on forms provided by the City Clerk.
(c) In the event the owner, devisees or heirs shall not have arranged for future interments, then the devisees or
the heirs, as the case may be, of such owner shall have the right of interment in the order of their need.
Only such persons as names appear on the Cemetery records of the City will be recognized as owners or
part owners of lots.
The title to a cemetery lot vests in the owners the right to use such lot for burial purposes only, for
themselves, their heirs, or for any such persons as they may choose to admit, in accordance with the Cemetery Rules
and Regulations.
Transfer of title of rights to interment may be made only by surrender of the original deed or certificate of
interment rights and issuance of new certificates of interment rights by the City to the new owners of lots or parts of
lots so transferred. Substitution of an unused lot or niche for interment rights in a like lot or niche is permitted with
approval of the Cemetery Superintendent. Charges may apply for these services, as prescribed by the fee schedule.
Lot owners desiring to dispose of an unused lot may surrender the original deed or certificate to the City Clerk and
be reimbursed by the City for the original purchase price of the lot. (Monies deposited into the perpetual care fund
are non-refundable.) All profits above the original sale price on transfer or resale shall accrue to the benefits of the
AmesMunicipal Cemetery.
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OF INTERMENT
PURCHASE OF LOTS OR COLUMBARIUM NICHES
Sup 2016-3 2 Rev. 07/01/2016
Prior to 1917, lots in the Ames Cemetery were cared for from the proceeds of lot sales, service charges, and
yearly assessments on lot owners if and when they could be collected. Such an indefinite and unreliable plan
resulted in inadequate care. In 1917 the City assumed responsibility for the Cemetery through transfer from the
Ames Cemetery Association. In order to assure a more reliable means for permanent care, the City, by Ordinance
No. 292, April 5, 1917, set up a perpetual care fund, from which the income provides maintenance of the Cemetery.
This fund is composed of a portion of the money received from each lot sale. State law directs the minimum amount
to be put into the fund and that the fund itself shall always remain intact, with only the annual income received from
it being used toward furnishing care. The amount set aside into the fund from each lot sale will vary from time to
time as determined by Council, and in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Iowa. The City shall maintain a
record of such amount. The fund may also be increased by gifts, bequests, a portion of memorial charges, and other
service revenues.
The term "Perpetual Care" shall be construed to mean the obligation which the City assumes to use the net
annual income received from investment of the fund to provide for the perpetual maintenance of cemetery property.
Such care shall include maintaining a pleasing lawn, leaf disposal, filling sunken graves, caring for avenues, alleys,
fences, buildings, and grounds in general. It is being understood that such expenditures shall be made at the
discretion and under the direction of the officer in charge of the Cemetery. The City shall not be bound to make a
separate investment of the money set aside for perpetual care from a particular lot sale, but the same shall be added
to the perpetual care fund of the City and the proceeds therefrom used by the City in the manner as heretofore
provided. Nothing herein shall be construed as modifying any existing contract as to perpetual care.
Each lot in the Cemetery (except a columbarium niche) will, prior to its sale, be suitably marked by the
City with a metal or concrete post placed on each lot corner and set level with the adjacent ground. To maintain
accuracy and uniformity of marking, substitute or additional corner posts may not be used.
No mounds shall be raised upon any grave above the general level of the lot. Mounds are difficult to
maintain, as the sod grows in an unnatural position and is easily injured by heat, drought and frost. The City reserves
the right at any time to remove unsightly mounds and to re-sod the grave at the general level of the lot.
No hedges, fences or enclosures of any kind will be permitted on or around lots. Wooden boxes, wreaths,
glass jars, bottles, toys, cans, and other unsightly objects will not be permitted and when used will be removed by
the City without notice. Flags and emblems may be used for a five-day period around May 30th or special days but
will be removed, without responsibility for preservation, if still in place after the five (5) days.
All landscaping, care of lots, and other work in the Cemetery will be done by the City, but it is desired that
each lot owner feel free to consult with those in charge of the Cemetery at all times.
The Cemetery reserves the right for its workers and those persons necessary to performance of normal
cemetery operation to enter upon or cross over any lot in the Cemetery in the performance of such duties.
The Cemetery or its employees assume no liability for actual damage or mental anguish created by the
performance of normal operations, or for loss by vandalism or other acts beyond reasonable control.
The Cemetery reserves the right to furnish, supply, and/or sell to its patrons such items as may be normally
used within the Cemetery, such as floral pieces, floral receptacles, grave decorations, memorials, and vaults or other
burial cases, etc.
The City reserves the right to amend or change rules and regulations to conform with newly developed
Cemetery practice.
The City reserves the right to alter, change, or close alleys, roadways, water mains, and other physical
properties of the Cemetery.
PRIVILEGES AND RESTRICTIONS
CARE OF LOTS

otherwise supplied.
All graves shall be dug by the City under the direction of the Superintendent. Depth of graves shall
conform to ruling by Iowa State Board of Health.
A charge for opening and closing a grave and the sodding and seeding of the mound will be made at a
current rate set by the City, which charge shall be paid in advance of interment, and include opening of the grave,
removal of excess material, refilling, and sodding.
The interment of the bodies of persons who have died of a contagious disease shall be in strict accordance
with the rules of the State Board of Health.
The lot owner or funeral director shall designate the location of the graves on the lot to the Superintendent
and any change of location made after the opening of the grave has begun shall be at the expense of the lot owner.
When definite information for locating a grave is not available in ample time for grave preparation to meet the time
requested for interment, the cemetery will exercise its best judgment in making location in order that the requested
time for interment may be met. The cemetery assumes no responsibility for any error in such location and an
additional charge will be made for any change requested.
The Cemetery Superintendent shall be given twenty-four hours notices in summer and thirty-six hours
notice in winter when the ground is frozen, for the opening and preparation of the grave prior to interment.
The interment of two bodies in one grave will not be allowed, except in case of mother and infant, two
cremation remains, twin children, or two children buried at the same time. No interment of any body other than that
of a human being will be permitted.
The Superintendent or delegated representative is expected to attend every interment, and to see that the
rules, regulations and strict proprieties of the Cemetery are observed.
As soon as flowers, wreaths, emblems, etc., used at funerals, or placed on graves at other times, become
unsightly and faded, they will be removed and no responsibility for their protection or maintenance is assumed.
Removals of bodies from graves in the Cemetery will only be made by the City in accordance with the
requirements of the statutes of the State and the rules of the State Board of Health. Charges made by the City for
removal will be based on the actual costs to the City of time and materials, with a minimum charge equal to twice
the current charge for interment.
Lot owners or their heirs desiring graves opened shall secure the necessary disinterment permit from the
State and deliver the same to the Cemetery Superintendent. All removals will be made by the City under the
supervision of a licensed embalmer.
For sanitary reasons, graves will not be reopened for inspection except for official investigation.

(except on City holidays), or at such other times as may be arranged with the cemetery superintendent.

grave liner is of permanent type and of sufficient strength to support the weight of the foundation and memorial, and
will not interfere with future grave openings.
Each monument or grave marker shall rest on a foundation approved by the City and paid for by the lot
owner. An installation service charge shall also apply.
Grave markers will be set according to regulations specified by the City. Specifications and instructions
governing the installation of memorials in specific sections of the cemetery are established by and available from the
cemetery superintendent upon request. For large monuments the City reserves the right to require the construction of
a foundation of such material, size, and design as will provide ample insurance against possible settlement or injury
to the stone work. The top of the concrete foundation will be constructed approximately one (1) inch below the base
of the stone work so as to permit the monument or marker to be set in a bed of cement mortar evenly covering the
concrete base.
The setting of monuments, stones, and markers and the transportation of all tools, materials, etc., within the
Cemetery grounds shall be subject to the supervision and control of the Superintendent. Heavy trucking will not be
permitted within the Cemetery when in the opinion of the Superintendent such work might cause injury to the
driveways.
Family monuments may be used in designated areas only, on lots of 180 square feet in area or more. On
lots containing less than 180 square feet of area, only grave markers may be used. Grave markers (sometimes called
"headstones" or "foot stones") may extend no more than three (3) inches above the natural ground level. All grave
markers shall be of bronze or a single piece of standard granite corresponding in color to the monument on the lot
and with all lettering on the upper surface of the stone and flush with or below the stone surface. No raised lettering
will be permitted.
The length of the base (including cap) of memorials or grave markers may not exceed 60 percent (60%) of
the total width of the grave space, or of the total width of contiguous grave spaces under the ownership of one
family. The width of the base (including cap) may not exceed fourteen (14) inches.
Stone or monumental work will not be permitted on a lot until the lot is fully paid for, and the City reserves
the right to refuse permission to erect any monumental work not in keeping with the good appearance of the
grounds.
Stone work or monumental work once placed on its foundation shall not be removed, except by permission
of the Superintendent of the Cemetery.
The City of Ames has no obligation to repair memorials or memorialization in the event of damage or
defacement by acts of vandalism, nor to restore them as a result of deterioration caused by age or weathering.
The following restrictions regarding monuments and grave markers apply to the sections of the Cemetery
as designated below:
"Unrestricted Monument Sections." Certain designated portions of the older part of the Cemetery have
unrestricted monument privileges which permit the erection of monuments or grave markers of any selected size and
design where lot area is sufficient to place monuments on solid grounds and will not interfere with future grave
openings.
"Restricted Monument Sections." In these sections of the Cemetery, monuments larger than double
headstones will be permitted only on designated lots containing a minimum of 180 square feet, and when individual
grave markers are used in addition to the family monument the top surface of such markers must be flush with the
natural ground level.
"Burial Park Sections." Certain sections of the Cemetery have been designated as "Burial Park Sections.”
In such sections no monuments or grave markers will be permitted which extend more than three (3) inches above
the ground surface of the lot.
Other Burial Park Sections have been designated for the use of flush-type memorials only. In such sections
memorials shall not extend above the surface of the lot and may not exceed six percent (6%) of the lot area.

such structures. All applications for permits to erect such structures shall be made in writing to the Cemetery
Superintendent. Complete plans and specifications of the proposed construction, including details of materials,
workmanship, method of constructions, etc., shall accompany such application and the approval of the Cemetery
Superintendent shall be obtained thereon before any construction work is begun. The right is reserved to prohibit the
erection of any structure that is not considered safe, suitable, or desirable.
Vaults or mausoleums will not be permitted on lots containing less than four hundred (400) square feet, and
the portion of the lot occupied by the building shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%), as determined by the
City.
A minimum setback of five (5) feet shall be required between the vault or mausoleum and the lot line.
Where the vault or mausoleum exceeds five (5) feet in height, the setback shall be five (5) feet plus one (1) foot for
each additional foot or fraction thereof over five (5) feet in height.
A columbarium shall have no attachments to the niche plates other than standard name and date plaques.
The bronze niche plaque must be provided by the manufacturer of the columbarium through the Ames Municipal
Cemetery.
All landscaping including planting of trees, shrubs, and flowers will be done by the Cemetery, but lot
owners are urged to feel free to consult with the Superintendent regarding matters pertaining to the general
beautification, care, and maintenance of lots in the Cemetery. Existing individual lot plantings that become unsightly
or undesirable may be removed by the City. Voluntary or memorial contributions for enhancements to the cemetery
grounds are welcome.
Fresh-cut flowers may be used and will remain until, in the judgment of the Cemetery, they become wilted
or unsightly. Containers for cut flowers are to be of a type that is installed so as to be level with the ground surface
and not holding water when not in use; or of the type to be disposed of when flowers are removed. Flower
containers and grave decorations not permanently installed may be removed and disposed of at the discretion of the
cemetery staff.
Potted plants may be set on lots, without disturbing sod, on special occasions such as Memorial Day,
birthdays, anniversaries, etc., but, if not removed within five (5) days, will be picked up and destroyed if unsightly,
or preserved for use in beds within the Cemetery if suitable.
No person will be permitted to trim, prune or remove branches from any tree or ornamental shrub in the
Cemetery whether on their lot or not. All work of pruning or trimming trees and shrubs shall be done by the
Superintendent or under the directions of the Superintendent. Upon request the Superintendent will do any pruning
needed without charge.
Plants or flowers may not be taken up or removed from the Cemetery or cuttings removed from plants
without permission from the Superintendent or under the Superintendent's directions. The observance of this rule is
necessary to prevent the theft of plants. Many plants, especially vines, interfere with the proper care of the lots and
graves and injure the grass. Such plants will be removed when found objectionable. All grave and flower beds will
be cleaned of tender plants after the first frost in the fall.
The payment of all fees and charges shall be made at the City Finance Office in the City Hall, where
receipts will be issued for all amounts paid.
A schedule of fees and charges as established by the City shall be made a part of these Rules and
Regulations and may be changed from time to time by resolution of the City Council.
The price of lots shall in all cases include an amount for perpetual care at least equal to the minimum
amount stipulated by Iowa State Law. The perpetual care fund is an irrevocable trust. Deposits cannot be withdrawn
even in the event of cancellation. Lot owners or others may voluntarily increase endowments through additional
contributions or bequests.

Sup 2016-3 6 Rev. 07/01/2016
It is urged that lot owners interest themselves in the present and future care of their lots, as a single
neglected lot mars the beauty of an entire section.
It is important that care be taken in selecting a monument to get a design which will harmonize with its
surroundings and not be a monotonous repetition of other stones in the Cemetery. Marble monuments are not
permanent in this climate and their use should be avoided. Granite offers the greatest permanence of any of the
stones commonly used. It is desirable that the Cemetery Superintendent be consulted before ordering monumental
work.
Prospective patrons may feel free to visit the Cemetery for information without obligation or pressure to
select. Lot owners are urged to feel free to contact the cemetery at any time if the meaning or intent of these Rules
and Regulations are not clear or if other information is desired.

Section One. The City of Ames, Iowa, hereby grants unto Interstate Power and Light Company, an Iowa

of twenty-five years from and after the date this ordinance becomes effective, to erect, construct, reconstruct, maintain,
and operate within the corporate limits of said City of Ames, Iowa, as the same now are or hereafter may be located or
extended, the plant and facilities for distribution of natural gas, whether said distribution systems have been heretofore
or hereafter may be constructed, together with the franchise and right to enter upon and to use and occupy the streets,
avenues, alleys, bridges, and other public places of said City as the same now are or hereafter may be located or
extended, for the purpose of constructing, reconstructing, maintaining, and operating therein, thereon, and thereunder

franchise and right to supply, distribute, and sell natural gas to said City and to the inhabitants thereof and others within

restrictions and regulations as are hereinafter contained, and such other reasonable rules and regulations as hereafter may
be provided by the rule-making body having jurisdiction thereof, and as provided by the State Code of Iowa.
Section Two. The Grantee shall maintain within said City a modern gas service, with sufficient capacity
to meet the reasonable requirements of its patrons, and shall supply same in such a manner as to render efficient service
unless prevented by an Act of God, a public enemy, a governmental authority, or by a cause not under the control of the
Grantee, and in any such event, the Grantee may adopt reasonable rules and regulations governing the volume of gas
which it shall be required to furnish its patrons or any class of patrons.
Sup 2009-4 B-2 Rev. 10-1-09
Section Three. The systems for the distribution of gas shall be constructed, maintained, and operated by the
Grantee in such a manner as not to endanger persons or property and so as not to interfere unreasonably with any
improvements the City may deem proper to make, or to hinder unnecessarily or obstruct the free use of the streets,
avenues, alleys, bridges, or other public places, and so as not to interfere with the construction or operation of sewers,
drainage or water system, electrical facilities, communications and fiber optic facilities, and other utility or signal lines
in the City. The City of Ames, Iowa, shall have the right to require the Grantee to remove, at its own cost and expense,
its existing facilities and equipment which interferes with or obstructs the construction, reconstruction, or repair of any
municipal facilities or public improvements. The City will attempt to give to the Grantee as much advance notice of the
removal requirement as the City deems possible.
Section Four. Whenever the Grantee, in erecting, constructing, or maintaining said distribution systems,
shall take up or disturb any pavement or sidewalk or make any excavations in the streets, avenues, alleys, bridges, or
public places of said City, such excavations shall be done pursuant to City permits and regulations and shall at once be
refilled and the pavement, sidewalk, or other improvement replaced to the satisfaction of the City officials, and in case
of its failure to do as promptly as is practical, the City may do so at the expense of the Grantee.
Section Five. The Grantee shall extend its mains as provided by its most current gas tariff and applicable rules
promulgated by the governing regulatory body for customers in all cases where bona fide customers apply in writing to
be supplied with gas. The Grantee shall furnish the service pipes from the main to the lot line without expense to the
customer, so long as it is not prohibited by regulatory agency rules. This ordinance shall allow the Grantee to appropriate
and condemn property when necessary to provide gas service to its customers, in accordance with the applicable
requirements contained in the Code of Iowa, following approval of the City Council. The Grantee must establish
necessity for each taking of private property, and when so established, the City Council may approve the condemnation
of private property by resolution. The owners of any property that may be subject to condemnation shall be given notice
at least ten days prior to any approval of such condemnation by City Council.
Section Six. The Grantee shall indemnify, defend, and hold the City harmless from and against any and all
claims, demands, losses, damages, costs, and expenses whatsoever (including, but not limited to, court costs, fines,
penalties, and reasonable attorney’s fees), judgments, liabilities, and causes of action of any nature whatsoever which
may arise through or by reason of the acts or omissions of Grantee, its employees, contractors, agents, and assigns related
to the construction, maintenance, and operation of said systems for the distribution of gas and other construction hereby
authorized.
Section Seven. Said Grantee shall have the right to supply, distribute and sell gas for any and all purposes to
said City and to the inhabitants thereof, and to charge therefor such just and reasonable rates as hereafter may be fixed
and determined by the rate-making body established under the laws of the State of Iowa and given jurisdiction thereof.
Section Eight. All of the provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to the successors or assigns of the Grantee
with the same force and effect as they do to the Grantee itself.
Section Nine. The Grantee shall, within sixty (60) days after the publication of this Ordinance, signify in writing
an acceptance of the grant herein, including the conditions and restrictions herein expressed, and this Ordinance, and the
franchise granted herein, shall not be operative or binding until such acceptance is filed with the City Clerk. Upon
acceptance, this ordinance shall supersede the prior franchise agreement between the City and the Grantee.
Section Ten. In its monthly billing, the Grantee shall include a Franchise Fee of 0% on the gross receipts from
the distribution, supply, or sale of gas to customers within the City of Ames. The Grantee shall commence the collection
of this Fee on the first of the month following the six-month notification by the City of Ames of an amount to be
collected. The Fee may be increased or decreased by the City with a minimum of six months notice to the Grantee, and
shall be limited to the maximum amount allowed by Iowa law. Such Franchise Fee shall be used by the City as allowed
by law, and shall cease upon repeal of the Fee by the City Council, or at the end of this ordinance. The Franchise Fee
will be applied to all customers’ bills in accordance with applicable Iowa law. Should actions by the State of Iowa, or
Sup 2009-4 B-3 Rev. 10-1-09
any of its regulatory agencies, invalidate the collection of this Franchise Fee, the Grantee shall be relieved of its
collection obligations. The Grantee shall be allowed to collect an additional .06% on the gross receipts from the
distribution, supply, or sale of gas to customers within the City of Ames to cover administrative expenses associated with
the collection of the Franchise Fee. This .06% charge shall be collected only when the Franchise Fee is being collected.
Section Eleven. The expense of the publication of this ordinance shall be paid by the Grantee. The term of
the non-exclusive franchise granted by this ordinance shall be twenty-five years from the date of acceptance by the
Grantee.

Sec. 3.3(1) Meter Reads, Estimating Bills
Readings of all meters used for determining charges to customers shall be scheduled
monthly. An effort shall be made to obtain readings of the meters on corresponding
days of each meter reading period.
It is the customer's responsibility to allow access to meters for reading. The utility
will not leave cards for customer reading when the meter reader is unable to obtain
access. Customers desiring to read the meter themselves may obtain five (5) selfread
meter reading cards from the city finance department. Such cards will be predated
to correspond with billing dates. A reading by the utility must be permitted
before more cards will be issued to the customer. A reading by the utility must be
permitted at least two times in a year for service to be continued.
If an actual meter reading cannot be obtained the utility may render an estimated bill
without reading the meter or supplying a meter reading form to the customer.
Only in unusual cases shall more than three consecutive estimated bills be rendered.
Sec. 3.3(2) Billing Form
The billing form shall include the following:
a. The actual or estimated meter readings at the beginning and end of the billing
period.
b. The dates of the meter readings.

i. Any conversions from meter reading units to billing units, or any other
calculations to determine billing units from recording or other devices or any
other factors.
j. The account balance brought forward.
Sec. 3.3(3) When Payable
A bill shall be due and payable when rendered and shall be considered delinquent
after twenty days from the date it is rendered. The bill shall be considered rendered
to the customer when deposited in the U.S. mail with postage prepaid. If delivery is
by other than U.S. mail, the bill shall be considered rendered when mailed to the lastknown
address of the party responsible for payment. The net rate shown on the
customer's bill must be received in the Finance office by the due date listed on the
bill. When payment is not so received, regardless of when mailed, the gross rate,
which includes a late payment charge of one and one-half percent per month of the
past-due amount shall apply. Failure to receive a properly rendered bill shall not
entitle the customer to relief from the late payment charge. Each customer will be
allowed one late payment per calendar year, without incurring a late payment charge
or affecting their credit rating.
If the customer makes partial payment in a timely manner, and does not designate the
service or product being paid for, the payment shall be credited pro rata between the
bill for utility services and related taxes. Provided, however, that the one forgiveness
of penalty per year provision shall also apply.
The date of delinquency for all residential customers, or commercial customers
whose consumption is less than 3,000 kWh per month, shall be changeable for cause
in writing; such as, but not limited to, 15 days from the approximate date each month
upon which income is received by the person responsible for payment. However, in
no case, shall the date of delinquency be changed more than 30 days beyond the date
of preparation of the previous bill. The utility prefers that customers who have
special budget needs utilize the budget billing or level payment plan per provisions in
Section 3.3(5).
Sec. 3.3(4) Where Payable
Bills shall be paid by mail, by direct payment in the Finance Customer Service office,
by direct payment through the Automatic Clearing House System, by depositing the
payment in a designated receptacle or by other means designated by the utility.

Sec. 3.3(5) Budget Billing
A budget billing payment plan shall be available to all residential customers or other
customers whose average consumption is less than three thousand kilowatt-hours per
month. Enrollment in the plan shall be open at any time of the year providing the
customer has paid any past or currently due bills. A customer on a budget billing
payment plan may not terminate or withdraw from the plan without the approval of
the utility except on the anniversary date of the plan. The budget billing payment
plan shall be terminated when a customer terminates their service with the utility.
Monthly payments shall be calculated at the time of entry into the plan by dividing
the total of the estimated charges for the next twelve billing periods for the same
service connection by twelve. For customers without a service history, the billing
period level payment will be the sum of estimated charges divided by the number of
standard billing intervals.
Budget payment amounts will be recalculated at least once per year on the
anniversary date of the customer’s budget billing payment plan. Budget payment
amounts may also be recomputed when requested by the customer or whenever
price, consumption, alone or in combination result in a new estimate differing by ten
percent or more from that in use.
An unpaid budget billing account balance shall not be carried forward when
recalculating a budget payment amount. However, a budget billing account’s
deferred debit balance shall be carried forward and added to the estimated charges
for service during the next year when the budget payment amount is recalculated.
This total will be the basis for computing the budget payment amount for the next
year.
The customer shall be notified of the revised payment amount when their budget
payment amount is recalculated. The notice shall be served not less than twenty
days prior to the date of delinquency for the first revised payment.
A customer on a budget billing plan who becomes delinquent in payments by reason
of amount or date will be subject to normal disconnection proceedings and the budget
billing agreement may be terminated.
The deferred balance shall be applied to the next bill generated on the account after a
budget billing plan is terminated. Any deferred debit will be due and payable per the
terms of the bill unless the customer requests a payment plan. Any deferred credit
will be applied to future bills unless the customer requests a refund.

Sec. 3.3(6) Agreement to Pay
a. Availability of a first payment agreement. The utility shall offer a customer an
opportunity to enter into a reasonable agreement to pay when the customer
cannot pay in full a delinquent bill for utility service or has an outstanding
debt to the utility for residential utility service and the customer is not in
default on a payment agreement with the utility.
b. Reasonableness. Whether a payment agreement is reasonable will be determined
by considering the current household income, ability to pay, payment history
including prior defaults on similar agreements, the size of the bill, the
amount of time and the reasons why the bill has been outstanding, and any
special circumstances creating extreme hardships within the household. The
utility may require the customer to provide confirmation of financial
difficulty prior to entering into an agreement. Confirmation may be a written
acknowledgment from the Department of Human Services or another agency
acceptable to the utility.
c. Terms of payment agreements
1. First Payment agreement. The utility shall offer customers who have
received a disconnection notice or have been disconnected 120 days
or less, and who are not in default on a payment agreement, the
option of spreading payments evenly over at least 12 months by
paying specific amounts at scheduled times. The utility shall offer
customers who have been disconnected more than 120 days, and who
are not in default on a payment agreement, the option of spreading
payments evenly over at least 6 months by paying specific amounts
at scheduled times.
a) The agreement shall include a provision for the payment
of future charges to the account. The utility may
require the customer to enter into a level payment
plan to pay the future charges to the account.
b) When the customer makes an agreement in person, a
signed copy of the agreement shall be provided to
the customer.
AMES MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC UTILITY
ELECTRIC TARIFF NO. 5
SERVICE RULES SHEET NO. 22
Sup. 2005-3 H-22 Rev. 07-01-2005
c) The utility may offer the customer the option of making
the agreement over the telephone or through
electronic transmission. When a customer makes an
agreement over the telephone or through electronic
transmission, the utility shall render the customer a
written document reflecting the terms and conditions
of the agreement within three days of the date the
customer and utility entered into the oral or
electronic agreement. The document will be
considered rendered to the customer when addressed
to the customer’s last-know address and deposited in
the U.S. mail with postage prepaid or sent to the
last-know address of the person responsible for
payment of the service. Unless the customer notifies
the utility within ten days from the date the
document is rendered, it will be deemed that the
customer accepts the terms and conditions of the
agreement. By making the first payment, a customer
also confirms the acceptance of the terms and
conditions of an oral or electronic agreement.
d) A customer on a first payment agreement shall be
granted at least one late payment of up to four days
beyond a specified payment date without creating a
default on the first payment agreement.
2. Second payment agreement. The utility shall offer a second payment agreement to a
customer who is in default of a first payment agreement if the
customer has made at least two consecutive full payments under the
first payment agreement. The customer shall be eligible for a term at
least as long as the term of the first payment agreement. The
customer shall be required to pay for future charges in addition to the
monthly payments under the second payment agreement and may be
required to make the first payment up front as a condition of entering
into the second payment agreement. The utility may require the
customer to enter into a level payment plan to pay future charges to
the account.
d. Refusal by the Utility. A customer may offer the utility a proposed payment
agreement. If the utility and customer do not reach an agreement, the utility
AMES MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC UTILITY
ELECTRIC TARIFF NO. 5
SERVICE RULES SHEET NO. 23
Sup. 2005-3 H-23 Rev. 7-1-2005
may refuse the offer orally, but must render a written refusal of the
customer’s final offer, stating the reason for the refusal, with three days of
the of the oral notification. The written refusal shall be considered rendered
when handed to the customer, delivered to the last-know address of the
person responsible for the payment of the service, addressed to the
customer’s last-know address and deposited in the U.S. mail with postage
prepaid, or sent to the last-know address of the person responsible for
payment of the service. A customer may protest the utility’s refusal of the
offered agreement by filing a written complaint, including a copy of the
utility’s refusal, with the Director of Finance, within ten days after the
rendering of the written refusal.
A customer may ask the Iowa Utilities Board for assistance in working out a
reasonable payment agreement. The request for assistance must be made to
the Board within ten days after the rendering of the written refusal. The
utility shall not disconnect the service during the review of the customer’s
request for assistance.
e. Default. Default of the agreement by the customer renders the customer subject
to disconnection with notice in accordance with the procedures specified in
this tariff.
Sec. 3.3(7) Minimum Bill
The minimum bill provided for in the rate schedule for each service class will apply
to any billing period during which service remains connected and the minimum
quantity of service is not used.
Sec. 3.3(8) Temporary Disconnections
The utility may, upon reasonable notice by a customer, make temporary
disconnections for the customer's convenience. Fees for reconnection of temporarily
disconnected service shall be set by the Ames City Council. There will be a charge
for reconnecting the service during business hours and a charge for reconnecting the
service during non-business hours. There shall be no charge if the customer requests
the service to be reconnected at least one working day before the service is
reconnected by the utility.

Sec. 3.3(9) Service Calls
The customer shall be billed for the cost of services not the responsibility of the
utility, as follows:
a. For a service call where the trouble is found to be on the customer's equipment,
the customer shall be billed for the cost of the service trip.
b. For a service call requesting the relocation of facilities belonging to the utility,
the customer shall be billed for the cost of direct labor and materials. An
advance deposit equal to the total estimated cost shall be required where the
estimate exceeds one hundred dollars .
c. For a service call requesting relocation of facilities belonging to the customer, the
customer shall be billed for the cost of direct labor, plus the cost of materials.
An advance deposit equal to the total estimated cost shall be required where
the estimate exceeds one hundred dollars.
Sec. 3.3(10)Customer Requested Meter Tests
The utility will periodically inspect and test meters in accordance with the
requirements of section 2.6 of this tariff and rules of the IDOC. In addition to regular
testing, the customer may request a meter test, providing that such tests need not be
made more frequently than once each twelve months. The customer or the
customer's representative may be present when the meter is tested and the results
shall be reported to the customer within a reasonable time. If the meter is within the
allowable tolerance, the customer shall be billed for the cost of the test, not to exceed
ten dollars.
Upon written application transmitted by mail to the commission by a customer or
utility, a test will be made of the customer's meter as soon as practicable under the
observation of a representative of the commission. The request must be accompanied
by a twenty dollar check or money order which will be forfeited to the utility should
the meter be within the allowable tolerance for error.
Sec. 3.3(11)Adjustment of Bills
a. Meter Error. Whenever a meter creeps or whenever a metering installation is
found upon any test to have an average error of more than 2.0 percent for
watthour metering; or a demand metering error of more than 1.5 percent in
addition to the errors allowed under accuracy of demand metering; an
AMES MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC UTILITY
ELECTRIC TARIFF NO. 5
SERVICE RULES SHEET NO. 25
Sup. 2005-3 H-25 Rev. 7-1-2005
adjustment of bills for service for the period of inaccuracy shall be made in
the case of over-registration and may be made in the case of underregistration.
The amount of the adjustment shall be calculated on the basis
that the metering equipment should be one hundred percent accurate with
respect to the testing equipment used to make the test. For watthour
metering installations the average accuracy shall be the arithmetic average of
the percent registration at ten percent of rated test current and at one hundred
percent of rated test current giving the one hundred percent of rated test
current registration a weight of four and the ten percent of rated test current
registration a weight of one.
b. Determination of adjustment. Recalculation of bills shall be on the basis of
actual monthly consumption except that if service has been measured by selfcontained
single-phase meters or three-wire network meters and involves no
billing other than for kilowatt-hours, the recalculation of bills may be based
on the average monthly consumption determined from the most recent thirtysix
months consumption data.
When the average error cannot be determined by test because of failure of
part or all of the metering equipment, it shall be permissible to use the
registration of check metering installations, if any, or to estimate the quantity
of energy consumed based on available data. The customer shall be advised
of the failure and of the basis for the estimate of quantity billed. The periods
of error shall be used as defined in immediately following subparagraphs (1)
and (2).
1. Over-registration. If the date when over-registration began can be
determined, such date shall be the starting point for determination of the
amount of the adjustment. If the date when over-registration began
cannot be determined it shall be assumed that the error has existed for the
shortest time period calculated as one-half of the time since the meter
was installed, or one-half the time elapsed since the last previous meter
installation test.
The over-registration due to creep shall be calculated by timing
the rate of creeping and assuming that the creeping affected the
registration of the meter for twenty-five percent of the time since
the more recent of either metering installation or last previous
test.
AMES MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC UTILITY
ELECTRIC TARIFF NO. 5
SERVICE RULES SHEET NO. 26
Sup. 2005-3 H-26 Rev. 07-01-2005
2. Under-registration. If the date when under-registration began can be
determined, it shall be the starting point for determination of the amount of
the adjustment except that billing adjustment shall be limited to the preceding
six months. If the date when under-registration began cannot be determined,
it shall be assumed that the error has existed for one-half of the time elapsed
since the more recent of either metering installation or last previous test,
except that billing adjustment shall be limited to the preceding six months.
The under-registration due to creep shall be calculated by timing the
rate of creeping and assuming that this creeping affected the
registration for twenty-five per-cent of the time since the more recent
of either metering installation or last previous test, except that billing
adjustment shall be limited to the preceding six months.
c. Refunds. If the recalculated bills indicate that five dollars or more is due an
existing customer or ten dollars or more is due a person no longer a customer
of the utility, the full amount of the calculated difference between the
amount paid and the recalculated amount shall be refunded to the customer.
Refunds shall be made to the two most recent customers who received
service through the metering installation found to be in error. In the case of a
previous customer who is no longer a customer of the utility, a notice of the
amount subject to refund shall be mailed to such previous customer at the last
known address, and the utility shall upon demand made within three months
thereafter refund the same.
d. Back Billing. A utility may not back bill due to under-registration unless a
minimum back bill amount is specified in its tariff. The minimum amount
specified for back billing shall not be less than, but may be greater than, five
dollars for an existing customer or ten dollars for a former customer. All
recalculations resulting in an amount due equal or greater than the tariff
specified minimum shall result in issuance of a back bill. The minimum
back billing amount for an existing customer is five dollars and for a former
customer is $30.
Back billings shall be rendered no later than six months following the date of
the metering installation test.
e. Overcharges. When a customer has been overcharged as a result of incorrect
reading of the meter, incorrect application of the rate schedule, incorrect
connection of the metering installation or other similar reasons, the amount
of the overcharge shall be adjusted, refunded or credited to the customer.
The time period for which the utility is required to adjust, refund, or credit
AMES MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC UTILITY
ELECTRIC TARIFF NO. 5
SERVICE RULES SHEET NO. 27
Sup. 2005-3 H-27 Rev. 7-1-2005
the customer’s bill shall not exceed five years unless otherwise ordered by
the Ames City Council.
f. Undercharges. When a customer has been undercharged as a result of incorrect
reading of the meter, incorrect application of the rate schedule, incorrect
connection of the metering installation or other similar reasons, the amount
of the undercharge may be billed to the customer. The period for which the
utility may adjust for the undercharge shall not exceed five years unless
otherwise ordered by the Ames City Council. The maximum back bill shall
not exceed the dollar amount equivalent to the rate for like charges (e.g.
usage-based, fixed or service charges) in the 12 months preceding discovery
of the error unless otherwise ordered by the Ames City Council.
g. Credits and explanations. Credits due a customer because of meter inaccuracies,
errors in billing, or misapplication of rates shall be separately identified.
Sec. 3.3(12)Adjustment of Bill for Accidental Wastage of Electricity
It is the customer's responsibility to maintain internal wiring and equipment. Should
an accidental ground occur on customer owned wiring and equipment thereby
resulting in higher than normal usage, there is no automatic release or formula for
discounting the bill.
Sec. 3.3(13)Returned Payments
A service charge may be assessed to any customer whose payment is returned unpaid
by the financial institution on which it was drawn. The Ames City Council will set
the amount of the service charge. The service charge shall be in addition to the late
payment charge if the payment is not made good and the service charge is not paid
prior to the net due date of the bill. The utility may require the customer to make
future payments with cash, cashier's check, or money order if two or more payments
are dishonored by the customer's financial institution within a year.
Sec. 3.4 Discontinuance and Denial of Service for Reasons Other Than Nonpayment of
Bill or Deposit
The utility reserves the authority to refuse or discontinue service for any of the
reasons listed below, subject to the provisions of this section and section 3.6 of this
tariff. Unless otherwise stated, the customer shall be given appropriate notice prior to
discontinuance of service and, in the event the customer has failed to comply with a
rule of the utility, he or she shall be given reasonable opportunity to comply with the

address, and telephone number of the certifying party, the nature of the health danger
and approximately how long the danger will continue. Initial verification by the
verifying party may be by telephone if written verification is forwarded to the utility
within five days.
Verification shall postpone disconnection for thirty days. In the event service is
terminated within fourteen days prior to verification of illness by or for a qualifying
resident, service shall be restored to that residence if a proper verification is
thereafter made in accordance with the foregoing provisions. If the customer does
not enter into a reasonable payment agreement for the retirement of the unpaid
balance of the account within the first 30 days and does not keep the current account
paid during the period that the unpaid balance is to be retired, the customer is subject
to disconnection in accordance with procedures specified in this tariff.

(1) 
Purpose. The Ordinance regulates and restricts the height, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts, and other open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residence, or other purposes in order to promote the health, safety and the general welfare of the City in the following ways: 

(a) 
To direct the development of the City in accordance with the Land Use Policy Plan, which is the City's comprehensive plan; 


(b)  To preserve the availability of agricultural land;  
(c)  To consider the protection of soil from wind and water erosion;

(2) Interpretation and Application. The provisions of the Ordinance are the minimum requirements for promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. If the Ordinance requires a greater width or size of yards, courts or other open spaces, or a lower height of buildings or less number of stories or a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or imposes other higher standards than are required in any other statute or local ordinance or regulation, the Ordinance shall govern. If any other statute or local ordinance or regulation requires a greater width or size of yards, courts or other open spaces, or a lower height of building or less number of stories, or a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or imposes other higher standards than are required by the Ordinance, such other statute or local ordinance or regulation shall govern. 
Sec. 29.103. VALIDITY, SEVERABILITY & EFFECTIVE DATE. 
(1) 
Validity & Severability. If any division, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or provision of the Ordinance is adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the same shall not affect the validity of the Ordinance as a whole or any division, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or provision thereof, other than the division, section, subsection, paragraph, 

sentence, clause, phrase, or provision so adjudged to be invalid or unconstitutional. All regulations or parts of regulations in conflict with the Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict.

(2) 
Qualifying Adaptive Reuses.  Any proposal for the adaptive reuse of a structure or group of contiguous structures, whether or not the proposal involves one or more Nonconforming Uses, Nonconforming Structures, and/or Nonconforming Lots, shall qualify for City Council review if the proposal meets all of the following conditions: 

(a) 
The proposed adaptive reuse must be residential, commercial, or a combination of such uses except if it is located in an industrial zone.  If the proposed adaptive reuse is located in an industrial zone, it may be devoted to any use or uses that the City Council finds compatible with the uses permitted in the industrial zone.  All adaptive reuses proposed in industrial zones, except industrial uses, require a Special Use Permit. 

(b) 
The structure or group of structures proposed for adaptive reuse must have historic, architectural, or economic value to the City justifying renovation and preservation, as determined by the City Council. 

(c) 
The City Council must determine that the long-term benefits of the proposed adaptive reuse outweigh any negative impact on the neighborhood of the proposed project and on the City, as compared with the alternative of having the structures demolished or remaining vacant or under utilized.

Sec. 29.307.  NONCONFORMITIES. 
(1) General. 
(a) Purpose.  It is the general policy of the City to allow uses, structures and lots that came into existence legally, in conformance with then-applicable requirements, to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to mitigate adverse impact on conforming uses in the vicinity. This Section establishes regulations governing uses, structures and lots that were lawfully established but that do not conform to one or more existing requirements of this Ordinance.  The regulations of this Section are intended to: 
(i) 
Recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use their property; 

(ii) 
Promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings; and 


(iii) Place reasonable limits on the expansion of nonconformities that have the potential to adversely affect surrounding properties and the community as a whole. 
(b) 
Unsafe Situations.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to permit the continued use of a building or structure found to be in violation of building, basic life safety or health codes of the City.  The right to continue any nonconformity shall be subject to all applicable housing, building, health and other applicable life safety codes. 

(c) 
Repair and Maintenance.  Normal maintenance and incidental repair may be performed on a conforming structure that contains a nonconforming use or on a nonconforming structure. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition, in accordance with an order of the Building Official. 

(d) 
Accessory Uses and Structures.  Nonconforming accessory uses and nonconforming accessory structures shall be subject to all provisions that govern Principal Uses and structures. 

(e) Determination of Nonconformity Status. 

(i) 
Whether a nonconformity exists shall be a question of fact to be decided by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, subject to appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

(ii) 
The burden of establishing that a nonconforming use or nonconforming structure lawfully exists under this Zoning Code, shall in all cases be the owner's burden and not the City's. 

(f) 
Reversion Prohibited.  No nonconforming use, building, structure and/or lot, if once changed to conform with the Ordinance shall thereafter be changed so as to be nonconforming again.  No nonconforming use, building, structure and/or lot, if once changed to more nearly conform with the Ordinance, shall thereafter be changed so as to be less conforming again. 

(2) 
Nonconforming Uses. Any use of any structure or lot that was conforming or validly nonconforming and otherwise lawful at the enactment date of this ordinance and is nonconforming under the provisions of this Ordinance or that shall be made nonconforming by a subsequent amendment, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the standards and limitations of this Section. 

(a) 
Movement, Alteration and Enlargement. No increase of intensity of use is permitted except in conjunction with the allowances of subsection b and c. Increase of intensity means any of the following: 


i. increase to the amount of floor area for a non-Household Living use, 
ii. an increase in the horizontal or vertical dimensions of a non-Household Living use (both indoor or outdoor), 
iii. a change in operation of a non-Household Living use that requires corresponding improvements to the site, 
iv. 
an increase in the amount of building coverage for a manufactured home, single or two-family dwelling as Household Living, 

v. 
an increase in the number of apartment dwelling units, SRO, and other self-contained dwelling units as Household Living, and 


vi. an increase in the number of bedrooms for an apartment dwelling unit, SRO, and other self-contained dwelling units as Household Living. 
(b) The building area, floor area, or dimensions of a nonconforming use may not be enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy parts of another structure or portions of a lot that it did not occupy on the effective date of this Ordinance, unless the enlargement, expansion or extension complies with all requirements for the zone, does not create an additional nonconformity, and is approved for a Special Use Permit by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, pursuant to the procedures of Section 29.1503, excluding 29.1503(4)(b)(vii) of the Review Criteria General Standards, and subject to subsection c. 
(c) 
Any building or structure containing a nonconforming use may be enlarged up to 125% of the floor area existing on the effective date of this ordinance, provided that the expanded building or structure complies with all development standards of the zone in which it is located. An increase in intensity of operations, dimensions, dwelling units, or apartment bedrooms shall not be specially permitted. 

The enlargement of a nonconforming use that has the effect of making a structure nonconforming, shall not be specially permitted pursuant to Section 29.1503, but rather shall be construed as a request for a variance, subject to the procedures of Section 29.1504. 

(d) 
Exterior or Interior Remodeling or Improvements to Structure. Exterior or interior remodeling or improvements to a structure containing a nonconforming use shall be permitted, provided that any proposed enlargement, expansion or extension shall be subject to the provisions set forth in the above paragraph. An increase in intensity is not permitted in conjunction with remodeling or other improvements to the structure. 

(e) 
Relocation of Structure.  A structure containing a nonconforming use shall not be moved unless the use and structure will comply with all of the regulations that apply in the new location. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize a structure containing a nonconforming use to be moved to another location on the same lot, provided that they determine that such a move will not have the effect of increasing the degree of nonconformity. 

(f) 
Change of a Nonconforming Use. Except as provided in this Section, a nonconforming use may be changed only to a use that conforms to the Ordinance. Once changed to a conforming use, no use may revert to, or be re-established as a nonconforming use. 


The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a Special Use Permit to allow a change from one valid nonconforming use to a different nonconforming use, provided it is determined that: 
(i)  The proposed use is in the same section 29.501(4) category of use as the current  
use;  
(ii)  No structural alterations will be made in the building or structure containing the  

use that increases any nonconformity; 
(iii) The proposed use will have no greater impact on the surrounding area than the existing nonconforming use; 
(iv) 
Adequate parking exists for the proposed use, based on parking standards in the Ordinance; and 

(v) 
The proposed use is compatible with surrounding land uses, based on the hours of operation and the ability to mitigate noise and light impacts by incorporating buffering between the proposed use and surrounding land uses where necessary. 


(Ord. No. 3983, 2-10-09) 
(g) Abandonment. 
(i) 
Effect of Abandonment. Once abandoned, a nonconforming use shall not be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the structure or lot must conform with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 

(ii) 
Evidence of Abandonment. A nonconforming use shall be presumed abandoned when any of the following has occurred: 

a. 
The owner has in writing or by public statement indicated intent to abandon the use; 

b. 
The building or structure has been removed through the applicable procedures for the condemnation of unsafe structures; 

c. 
The owner has physically changed the building or structure or its permanent equipment in such a way as to clearly indicate a change in use or activity to something other than the nonconforming use; or 

d. 
The use has been discontinued, vacant or inactive for a continuous period of at least one year. 


(iii) Notice. Upon the occurrence of any of the events described in Section 3(b) above, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall document such event and shall issue a notice to the property owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, stating that the property owner's intent to abandon the Nonconforming Use is presumed, and that the Nonconforming Use will be terminated unless the property owner submits an Answer within 30 days of the date the notice was issued. However, no notice of abandonment is required when a property owner has initiated a change of use or received approvals from the City for changes to use of the property or property improvements. 
(iv) 
Answer. The Answer shall indicate the property owner's intention to resume the Nonconforming Use and shall describe the actions the property owner intends to take within 90 days of submission of the Answer to resume the Nonconforming Use. Answers must be on forms provided by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. 

a. 
If an Answer is submitted within 30 days of the issuance of the Notice, but the Nonconforming Use is not resumed within the 90 days following submission of an Answer, the Nonconforming Use shall be terminated at the end of that 90-day period.  Once a Nonconforming Use is terminated, subsequent uses of the property must conform to this Ordinance. 

b. 
If no Answer is submitted within 30 days of the issuance of the Notice, the Nonconforming Use will be terminated. 

(v) 
Overcoming Presumption of Abandonment. The presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon a showing, to the satisfaction of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, that during the 12-month period in question,  the owner of the land or structure has been: 

a. 
maintaining the land and structure in accordance with the Building Code and did not intend to discontinue the use; 


b.  actively and continuously marketing the land or structure for sale or  
lease; or  
c.  engaged in other activities that would affirmatively prove there was no  
intent to abandon.  
(vi)  Calculation of Period of Abandonment. Any period of discontinuance  or  

cessation of use caused by government actions, fire or natural calamities, and without any contributing cause by the owner of the nonconforming use, shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance pursuant to this Section for up to 18 months from the date of the event. 
(Ord.No. 4376, 1-8-19) 
(3) 
Nonconforming Structures. A nonconforming structure that lawfully occupies a site on the effective date of this Ordinance that does not conform with the Zone Development Standards of the underlying Zone or the General Development Standards of this Ordinance may be used and maintained, subject to the standards and limitations of this Section. 

(a) 
Maintenance and Repair. Maintenance, remodeling and repair of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted without a variance or a Special Use Permit, provided that such maintenance, remodeling or repair does not increase the degree of nonconformity. 


(i) Remodeling. An alteration to a nonconforming structure is classified as remodeling if, either the majority of the exterior walls or the roof is maintained through-out construction. In the event only an element of the structure (e.g. one wall) is non-conforming the remodeling of that feature must maintain 50% or more of its structural support and wall assembly to be considered remodeling and not rebuilding of the structure. Nothing within this definition is intended to restrict the adding or changing of window and door openings or changes to exterior siding and roof materials in relation to the percentage limitations. (Ord.No. 4376, 1-8-19) 
(b) Occupancy by a Conforming Use. A nonconforming structure may be occupied by any use allowed in the Zone in which the structure is located, subject to all other applicable use approval procedures and conditions. 
(c) Restoration of a Damaged Nonconforming Structure. 
(i) 
Any nonconforming structure damaged to the extent of 70% or less of its assessed value by fire, wind, tornado, earthquake, or other natural disaster may be rebuilt, provided such rebuilding does not increase the intensity of use, as determined by the number of dwelling units (for residences) or floor area or ground coverage (for nonresidential uses), does not increase the nonconformity, complies with all other legal requirements, and is completed within 18 months from the time of damage.  The structure shall not be rebuilt closer to the property line than the original structure or the applicable district setback lines, whichever is closer. 

(ii) 
Any nonconforming structure damaged to the extent of more than 70% of its assessed value may not be rebuilt, repaired, or used unless the rebuilt structure conforms with all regulations of the district in which it is located or unless the Zoning Board of Adjustment approves the reconstruction by granting a Special Use Permit after determining that restoration will be made to the fullest extent possible in conformance with applicable zoning standards. 

(d) 
Enlargement and Expansion. A nonconforming structure may not be enlarged, expanded or extended unless the enlargement, expansion, or extension conforms to the requirements of this ordinance. 

(e) 
Relocation.  The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize a structure containing a nonconforming use to be moved to another location on the same lot, provided that it determines that such a move will not have the effect of increasing the degree of nonconformity. 

(f) 
Detached Garage.  If a property owner enlarges, expands or extends a principal building on a site in a residential zoning district in conformance with the applicable development standards, and if such expansion, extension or enlargement shall result in a conforming detached garage in the rear yard or a detached garage in the rear yard that is lawfully nonconforming as to setback becoming a detached garage in the side yard that does not meet the applicable side yard setback requirements, such enlargement, expansion, or extension may continue none the less without a variance from the Zoning Board of Adjustment under the following circumstance. The conforming or lawfully nonconforming detached garage in the rear yard shall have occupied the site prior to the effective date of this Ordinance. 


(Ord. No. 3606, 1-23-01; Ord. No. 3961, 7-15-08) 
(4) 
Nonconforming Lots. Lots of record lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance which do not meet the requirements of this Ordinance for lot size and minimum frontage shall be deemed Nonconforming Lots and shall be governed by the following: 

(a) 
Use of Nonconforming Lots. Any Nonconforming Lot may be built upon so long as all use, density and coverage standards and all spatial standards other than minimum lot size and minimum frontage requirements are met. 

(b) 
Vacant Lot.  If the lot or parcel was vacant on the date on which this Ordinance became applicable to it, then the owner may use the property as permitted by the applicable Zone, provided that the use shall comply with applicable dimensional requirements of this Ordinance to the maximum extent practicable.  If the applicable Zone permits a variety of uses or a variety of intensities of uses and one or more uses or intensities would comply with applicable setback requirements while others would not, then only the uses or intensities that would conform with the applicable setback requirements shall be permitted. Otherwise the owner may seek a variance from such requirements from the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

(c) 
Lot with Building or Structure.  If the lot or parcel contains a building or structure on the date on which this Ordinance become applicable to it, then the owner may continue the use of that building or structure and may reasonably expand the structure in any way that does not increase the degree of nonconformity; an increase in building size shall not be deemed to increase the degree of nonconformity unless it increases the encroachment on a required setback or height limitation. Remodeling of a structure within the existing building footprint or expansion in compliance with this Section shall not require a variance but shall be reviewed by the Zoning Enforcement Officer as though the lot were conforming. 

(d) 
Lot Merger.  If 2 or more adjoining lots of record, at least one of which is undeveloped, are in the same ownership and any of these lots are made nonconforming by this Ordinance or any amendment thereto, the parcels of land involved shall be considered a single lot for purposes of applying this Ordinance and no portion of said lot shall be divided off, sold, or used in any manner which violates the lot size and frontage 


requirements of this Ordinance. 
(5) Other Nonconformities. 
(a) 
Examples of Other Nonconformities.  The types of other nonconformities to which this Section applies include: 

(i) 
Fence height or location; 

(ii) 
Lack of buffers or screening; 


(iii) Lack of or inadequate landscaping; 
(iv) Lack of or inadequate off-street parking; and 

(v) 
Other nonconformities not involving the basic design or structural aspects of the building, location of the building on the lot, lot dimensions or land or building use. 

Development that is consistent with a Site Development Plan approved before the date that this Ordinance became effective shall be deemed to be in conformance with this Ordinance to the extent that it is consistent with the approved plan and to the extent that such plan or conditions imposed thereon directly addresses the specific issue involved in the determination of conformity. However, redevelopment of a site with a prior Site Development Plan approval must conform to the current zoning standards for issuance of a new certificate of compliance. 

(b) 
Policy. Because nonconformities such as those listed above involve less investment and are more easily corrected than those involving lots, buildings and uses, it is generally the policy of the City to eliminate such other nonconformities as quickly as practicable. Practicable improvements take in to account current conditions, planter dimensions, building spacing and scope of improvements proposed for a property. Front yard landscaping, parking lot landscaping and screening shall be reviewed in each instance where new or redevelopment is proposed with a Site Development Plan. Although full compliance may not be achievable, all sites must advance towards compliance with current requirements in terms of location of plantings and quantity of plantings. 


(Ord. No. 4329, 12-12-17) 
(c) Increase Prohibited.  The extent of such other nonconformities shall not be increased without a variance.

Sec. 29.403.  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING. 
The purpose of this section is to protect and promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the City by requiring landscaping in relation to development of property in such a manner to ameliorate effects of wind, heat, and glare; to act as a valuable component of natural drainage systems, to incorporate native and existing vegetation, to improve storm water runoff quality, to help clean and refresh air by returning oxygen to the atmosphere, to conserve and stabilize property values through screening of incompatible uses and activities, and to promote a healthy and aesthetically interesting natural environment so as to create an attractive and desirable community for the City’s many visitors, residents, and employees. 
1. Non-Residential Landscaping Standards 
Non-residential landscaping standards are designed to be applied on commercial, industrial or other non-residential sites. The minimum areas required to be landscaped are listed in the Zone Development Standards Tables for Base Zones. In the case of Special Purpose Districts and Overlay Zones, landscaping, screening and buffer standards are set forth in the applicable Article. Required landscaping and screening of Article IV must meet the standards referenced in each applicable Zone Development Standards Table, supplemental standards, and general development standards of Chapter 29. 
(Ord. 4312, 6-27-17) 
(A) Front Yard Landscaping 
Front yard landscaping standards are designed to provide decorative and well thought out landscaping between streets and parking lots and between streets and buildings. These landscape standards are a combination of low height decorative plantings and significant trees arranged in a manner that complements and enhances the general site layout.  The front yard, for the purposes of calculating front yard landscaping, is the area between any abutting street and any building, parking lot or loading area. (see figure below) 
(i) Front Yard Planting Requirements 
(a) 
The landscaped front yard for parking lots shall be a minimum of 10 feet in depth from the property line to the first edge of paving unless the base zone specifies a greater setback. The maximum depth of a landscaped front yard for the purpose of calculating landscaping is 30 feet. 

(b) 
The Planning Director may approve a minimum 7-foot front yard depth in certain circumstances in order that a site may achieve dimensional requirements of parking stalls for required parking.  When a reduction in depth is approved, the minimum landscaped area plantings shall be calculated by the original 10-foot requirement. 

(c) 
  The minimum landscaped front yard for buildings shall conform to the dimensional setback requirements of the base zone. The maximum depth of landscaped front yard for the purpose of calculating landscaping is 30 feet. 

(d)
 The front yard landscaped area requires minimum base plantings of 1 overstory tree per 50 lineal feet of street frontage or part thereof, and for the planting of 8 shrubs and 12 ornamental grasses per 1,000 square feet of front yard area. The front yard area is calculated across the entire frontage of a site regardless of interruptions, such as walkways, encroachments, or driveways. 

(1)
 In some circumstances where screening of residential properties are a priority for the front yard, the Planning Director may require denser planting of materials and for larger planting materials to provide a taller and denser screen of site activities and parking.  

(2) 
Additionally, if overhead utilities are in place, the Planning Director may approve overstory trees to be substituted with alternative locations for planting of trees or for the planting of smaller trees. 

(B) 
Alternative Front Yard Plantings In order to promote design interest and diversity, a property owner may propose substitution of landscaping to enhance the front yard area in accordance with this Section. Substitutions that promote sustainability, color, and texture are desirable. If arrangement of plantings and use of substitution landscaping diminishes any necessary parking lot and loading area the screening will not be approved. 

(1) 
Front yard plantings must contain a minimum of 4 overstory trees within the front yard(s) of a site before allowing for substitutions. For sites that exceed 200 linear feet of frontage, ornamental trees may be substituted at a rate of 2 for every 1 overstory tree for every required tree after the first 4 trees. No more than 50% of the total trees planted to meet 1 per 50 linear foot standard shall be ornamental. For example, a 300-foot frontage would require either 6 overstory trees or as few as 4 overstory trees with 4 ornamental trees.  A 500-foot frontage would require 10 overstory trees or as few as 7 overstory trees with 6 ornamental trees. 

(a) 
Coniferous trees may be used in place of ornamental trees. No more than 30% of the total required trees shall be coniferous trees unless specifically required to assist in screening of a site. 

(2) 
Storm Water Treatment Features When a site includes a landscaped based stormwater treatment feature, e.g. bio-cell, rain garden, or bio-swale, an alternative configuration of ground cover and shrubs and grasses may be approved by the Planning Director when the 


landscape design provides for storm water quality treatment and includes plantings with visual interest within and along the feature. 
(3) Shrub/Grass Substitutions 
(a) Large landscaped undulations or berms may be incorporated into the landscape 

design with an allowance for up to a 35% reduction in required plantings of shrubs and grasses. 
(b) Additional ornamental grasses may be substituted for 50% of required shrubs at a rate of 3 grasses for 1 shrub. 
(c)  Additional shrubs may be substituted for ornamental grasses at a rate of 1 shrub for  
3 grasses.  
(d)  Decorative ground covers, flower beds, or similar plantings with interesting color  

and textures may be substituted at a rate of 60 square feet for 2 shrubs or 6 ornamental grasses for up to 50% of required shrubs and ornamental grasses. 
(4) Design and Configuration
 (a) 
Required front yard landscaping is encouraged to take on a variety of configurations including clustering, layered rows, alternating patterns or other designs. Front yard plantings are to be arranged in a manner that is well dispersed throughout the yard area, but may be clustered for interest and needed parking lot screening.  Although clustering and creating areas of interest is encouraged, some landscaping shall be dispersed throughout a yard and not all materials may be shifted or concentrated to one area of the yard. 

(b) 
Plantings may be provided in any area between a building or a parking lot and the street when the landscaping is primarily arranged to be publicly visible from the street or upon immediate entry to a site.   

(c) 
In circumstances where there is a constraint on plantings due to space, the Planning Director may authorize front yard landscaping to be placed in areas near side property lines, wrapped around buildings, or placed within parking lot islands closest to the front yard. 

(C). Front yards shall be maintained with landscaping however, walkways, plazas, ornamental features, are permitted within the front yard, but they do not allow for a reduction in the calculated front yard landscaping. 

   (D) 
Diversity Requirements Required front yard landscaping must contain a mix of tree, shrub, and grass species based upon the overall area and number of plantings. A mix of species would not exceed more than approximately 50% of any one species of trees, shrubs, and grasses. 

(E) 
Landscaping Requirements for Surface Parking and Loading Areas. Parking lot landscaping standards are designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing parking lot design combined with the support and encouragement of sustainability through increased shading from trees and allowing for stormwater treatment design within parking lots. 

(i) Surface Parking Lot Landscaped Area 

(a) 
Parking lots must contain landscaped area equal to 10% of the total gross parking lot and loading areas. The gross area of a parking lot is defined as the area of the paved surface measured from the back of the curb or edge of paving when there is not a curb, excepting landscaped islands and medians. Driveways within the front yard landscape area are excluded from the gross area of a parking lot. 

b. 
Overstory shade trees must be planted at a rate of 1 tree for every 200 square feet of the required 10% landscape area. Trees must be dispersed across the entire parking lot area and not overly concentrated to any one area of the parking lot. 

c. 
Perimeter side and rear yard planters abutting a parking lot that are 5 feet in depth or greater may count towards the 10% area requirements. Note that to meet the dispersal requirement for the parking lot, a site may need to exceed 10% landscaped area. If parking lot landscaping is placed in perimeter planting areas the landscaping must be located within 10 feet of the edge of paving to count towards the required 10% area. No area of the front yard landscaping shall count toward parking lot landscaping. 

d. 
Parking lot required tree planters and islands must be a minimum of 150 square feet and 7 feet in depth in all directions.  

(e) 
In single drive aisle double loaded parking lots with three or fewer required trees, the trees may all be placed on one side of the parking lot. 

(f) 
The Planning Director may approve a reduction of up to three required parking stalls to accommodate a vehicular cross-access route to an adjoining property. 

(F) Perimeter Parking Lot Planters and Bufferyards 

(i) 
Side and rear perimeter bufferyard landscaping is required for screening of the parking lot and use of a site when it abuts a dissimilar principal use.  

(a) 
When abutting a residential zone a high screen must be installed. In some circumstances the base zone or overlay may require additional width or a greater level of buffering.   

(b) 
During Site Development Plan review the City may require additional bufferyard depth and plantings when a commercially zoned or industrially zoned lot is used for a dissimilar use. 

(ii) 
When a perimeter bufferyard is not required, parking lots must be setback a minimum of three feet from all side and rear property lines. Parking lot planters less than 5 feet that are not landscaped do not count towards base zone requirements. Planting areas less than 5 feet in width shall not include turf or lawn, but may have other low maintenance ground cover or ornamental plantings. 

(G)  
Parking Lot Landscape Medians In addition to the 10% parking lot landscaped area requirement, a landscaped median is required for every 3 contiguous double loaded parking drive aisles. 

(i) 
A required median must be a minimum of 15 feet wide with a minimum length equal to the average drive aisle length of the contiguous double loaded aisles. 

(ii) 
A landscaped median must include 1 overstory shade tree for every 50 linear feet of median. The trees must be located within a landscaped area that is a minimum of 7 feet in any one direction and totals 150 sq. ft. of area.  


(iii) Landscaped medians must include a minimum of 30% of the area landscaped with ornamental or decorative landscaping that does not include lawn or turf. 
(iv) 
The median may include a walkway when it does not encroach upon the placement of trees or the 30% decorative landscape requirement. 

(v) 
Alternative Median Configurations Landscape medians may be configured into oversized landscape islands with a minimum size of 400 square feet for each island. The total area of all oversized islands must equal the calculated required area of the median.  The 

oversized islands must be located within the parking lot and may not be configured along the perimeter of a parking lot. 

(H) 
Stormwater Treatment Credit in Parking Lots If treating stormwater within a parking lot landscaped area, the required parking lot landscaping in this ordinance may be substituted by up to 20%.  To be eligible for this reduction, the storm water treatment features must treat at least 30% of total site storm water volume needed to meet storm water quality standards of Chapter 5b. The storm 

water measures must be within or abutting the parking lot as part of a bio-swale, rain garden or other bio-retention treatment process. Detention and retention ponds are not eligible features for reducing landscaping. 

(I) 
Loading Areas A loading area shall require landscaping equal to 10% of the loading area. The required landscape area shall be provided adjacent to or within the impervious space where the loading area is located. A loading area is defined as an impervious area used for maneuvering vehicles principally for the purposes of loading or unloading trucks but are 


not considered parking lots. Loading areas for businesses within the DSC and CSC Zoning Districts or businesses relying upon an alley for maneuvering of trucks are exempt from this requirement. 
2. Landscaping Requirements for Residential Uses. 
Residential landscaping standards are designed to provide decorative and well thought out landscaping between streets and parking lots and between streets and buildings. These landscape standards are a combination of low level decorative plantings and significant trees arranged in a manner that complements and enhances the general site appearance.  The front yard, for the purposes of calculating front yard landscaping, is defined as the area between the building and any abutting street and the area between the street and a parking area. 
 (A) Front Yard Planting Requirements 
(i) 
The minimum landscaped front yard setback for buildings shall conform to the requirements of the base zone for principal buildings. 

(ii) 
The landscaped front yard for parking lots shall be a minimum depth equal to the building setback requirement measured from the property line to the first edge of paving. 


(iii)  The minimum front yard landscaped area requires base plantings of 1 overstory tree per 50 lineal feet of street frontage. Up to 50% of required overstory trees may be substituted with ornamental or coniferous trees at a 2 for 1 ratio. 
(iv) 
Front yards between the street and parking lot require a planting density that provides for a moderate level of screening with 12 shrubs per 50 linear feet of street frontage associated with the parking lot.

   (a) 
A pro rata share of plantings may be substituted with ornamental grasses at a 3 to 1 ratio of grasses to shrubs if the layout provides for enhanced visual interest and a sufficient level of screening. No more than 75% of required shrub plantings may be substituted with ornamental grasses. 

(v)
 Front yards in all areas not between parking lots and streets require the planting of shrubs with a mix of deciduous and coniferous at a rate of 9 shrubs for every 50 linear feet of street frontage not associated with parking lots. Ornamental grasses may be substituted for shrubs at a rate of 3 grasses for 1 shrub. No more than 75% of total required front yard landscaping may be substituted with ornamental grasses. 


(Ord. 4329, 12-12-17) 
(vi)     
Large landscaped undulations or berms may be incorporated into the landscape design with an allowance for up to a 35% reduction in required plantings of shrubs. 

(B) Design and Configuration 

(i)  
 Required front yard landscaping is encouraged to take on a variety of configurations including clustering, layered rows, alternating patterns or other designs. However, some landscaping shall be dispersed throughout a yard and not all materials may be shifted or concentrated to one area of the yard. In circumstances where there is a constraint on plantings due to space, the front yard landscaping may be placed in areas near side property lines, wrapped around buildings, or placed within parking lot islands closest to the front yard. 

(ii) 
Uniform spacing along the foundation with a single row of plantings is discouraged. Grouping in designated planter areas is preferred for the building front yard landscaping. The majority of the building façade length shall have plantings within approximately 15 feet of the building. 


(iii) The Planning Director may approve an alternative front yard planting scheme in place of shrubs that includes larger shrub species and ornamental trees in lieu of low growing shrubs. The Planning Director may also approve decorative planter beds in lieu of some of the required shrub plantings. 
(iv) 
If overhead utilities exist and are not planned to be placed underground, the Planning Director may approve overstory trees to be substituted with alternative locations for planting of trees or for the planting of smaller trees. 

(v) 
Required front yard trees may be placed within the public right-of-way if there is adequate space along the street frontage and there are no street trees located along the frontage of the site and no overhead utilities are in place. The Planning Director in consultation with the Streets and Maintenance Manager, or designee, must approve the proposed tree species as appropriate to the City’s street tree standards and its placement. 

(vi) 
When a site includes a landscaped based stormwater treatment feature of a bio-cell, rain garden, or bio-swale, an alternative configuration of ground cover and shrubs and grasses may be approved by the Planning Director when the design provides for storm water quality treatment and includes plantings with visual interest within and along the feature. 

(C) 
Diversity requirements Required front yard landscaping must contain a mix of tree, shrub, and grass species based upon the overall area and 

number of plantings. A mix of species will not exceed more than approximately 50% of any one species of trees, shrubs, and grasses. 

(D)
 Landscaping Requirements For Surface Parking Lots. Parking lot landscaping standards are designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing parking lot design combined with the support and encouragement of sustainability through increased shading from trees and allowing for stormwater 


treatment design within parking lots. Increased parking lot separation is required along the boundaries of properties with one and two-family homes. 
(i) Surface Parking Lot Landscaped Area 
(a)
 Parking lots must contain landscaped area equal to 10% of the total gross parking lot. The total gross area of a parking lot is defined as the area of the paved surface measured from the back of the curb or edge of paving excepting landscaped islands, landscaped medians, and driveways within the front yard landscape area. 

(b)
 Perimeter side and rear yard planters abutting a parking lot that are 5 feet in depth or greater may count towards the 10% area requirement. 

(c) 
If parking lot landscaping is placed in perimeter planting areas the landscaping must be located within 10 feet of the edge of paving to count towards the required 10% area. 

(d) No area of the front yard landscaping shall count toward parking lot landscaping. 

(e) 
Overstory shade trees must be planted at a rate of 1 tree for every 200 square feet of the required 10% landscape area. Note that to meet the dispersal requirement for the parking lot, a site may need to exceed 10% landscaped area. 


(Ord. No. 4329; 12-12-17) 
(f) Trees must be dispersed across the entire parking lot area and not overly concentrated to any one area of the parking lot. 
(g)  Parking lots with less than 3 required trees may place all trees on one side of the  
parking lot.  
(h)  Parking lot required tree planters and islands must be a minimum of 150 square  

feet and 7 feet in depth in all directions. 
(E) Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping and Bufferyards 
Side and rear yards abutting a parking lot, excepting front yard driveways, require a High Screen adjacent to residential zoning.
   (i) Buffer yards adjacent to one and two-family homes must be 10 feet in width and may be reduced to 5 feet in width with installation of a 6 foot solid fence. 
(Ord. No. 4329; 12-12-17) 
(ii) Parking lots located adjacent to outlots of a subdivision may qualify for reduced landscape screening based upon the spacing and use of the adjacent outlot and the properties abutting the opposite property line 
of the outlot. Use of lower growing shrubs or substitution of other equivalent materials or a greater spacing of plantings may be permitted by approval of the Planning Director. 
(F) Parking Lot Landscape Medians 
In addition to the 10% parking lot landscaped area requirement, a landscaped median is required for every 3 contiguous double loaded parking drive aisles. 
(i) 
A required median must be a minimum of 15 feet wide with a minimum length equal to the average drive aisle length of the contiguous double loaded aisles. 

(ii) 
A landscaped median must include 1 overstory shade tree for every 50 linear feet of median. The trees must be located within a landscaped area that is a minimum of 7 feet in any one direction and totals 150 sq. ft. of area.  


(iii) Landscaped medians must include a minimum of 30% of the area landscaped with ornamental or decorative landscaping that does not include lawn or turf. 
(iv) 
The median may include a walkway when it does not encroach upon the placement of trees or the 30% decorative landscape requirement. 

(v) 
Alternative Median Configurations Landscape medians may be configured into oversized landscape islands with a minimum size of 400 square feet for each island. The total area of all oversized islands must equal the calculated required area of the median.  The 

oversized islands must be located within the parking lot and may not be configured along the perimeter of a parking lot. 

(G) 
Stormwater Treatment Credit in Parking Lots If treating stormwater within a parking lot landscaped area, the required parking lot landscaping in this ordinance may be substituted by up to 20%.  To be eligible for this reduction, the storm water treatment features must treat at least 30% of total site storm water volume needed to meet storm water quality standards of Chapter 5b. The storm 


water measures must be within or abutting the parking lot as part of a bio-swale, rain garden or other bio-retention treatment process. Detention and retention ponds are not eligible features for reducing landscaping. 
(H) Other Residential Site Landscaping Standards 
(i) 
When an apartment development consists of multiple buildings, landscaping with trees, grasses, flowers, or shrubs shall be planted in open areas and along foundations or near primary entrances as practicable to the available space. 

(ii)
 Decorative Highway Landscaping. On residential sites abutting Highway 30 or Interstate 35 a landscape buffer consisting of coniferous plantings of 1 coniferous tree per 30 lineal feet of highway frontage must be provided. Plantings are not required to be placed on center. Up to 20% of the required coniferous trees may be substituted with overstory trees. 


(iii) Short Term Lodging (Hotel) Short term lodging establishments shall be landscaped in accordance with the non-residential landscaping standards when located within a commercial base zone.  If located within a residential base zone, short term lodging shall meet the residential landscaping requirements.

3. General Requirements All Sites. 
The following standards are required on all residential and non-residential sites. 
(A) 
Any required plant materials shall be rounded up to the next whole number when there is a calculated fraction of a plant. Rounding will occur upon calculation of the base standards before approving substitutions. 

(B) Required Landscaped Area Conditions. 

(i) 
Required yard areas, bufferyards or planters must have suitable soil conditions and depth exclusive of retaining walls, fill or other inorganic materials to permit the growth and maturity of the plant. 

(ii) 
Soil located in required planting areas (yard areas, bufferyards, or planters) must be either topsoil from the site (pre-approved by the City) or soil conditioned and tilled into the top 6 inches with at least a 5% organic content. The approved landscape plan must specify the approach to meeting soil quality standards. Certification of the soil conditioning and quality must be provided by a contractor, licensed engineer, or landscape specialist prior to approval of final occupancy certificate for a building. 

(C) 
Existing vegetation Existing vegetation within the developed area of a site may be credited towards the corresponding landscape requirement for trees, shrubs, and groundcover. Trees in good condition and of a desirable species that are greater than 8-inches in 


diameter may count at a 2 to 1 ratio and trees greater than 12-inches in diameter may be count at a 3 to 1 ratio.  Retained trees must be protected during construction. 
(D) Minimum planting standards. 
(i) 
Shrubs. Initial planting of shrubs shall be of #2 container class or greater in size or approximately 18 inches in height. 

(ii) 
Screening Height. Any materials planted for the purpose of achieving screening and for bufferyards shall be plant varieties that at installation are a minimum of 4 feet in height or 75% of the height of screened facility with the ability to mature to full screening requirements. 


(iii) Bufferyards and Planter Area Slope and Plant Height. Bufferyards and planters must be relatively flat to ensure fences and plant materials grow or stand upright and achieve the intended height. The height of plant materials shall be measured from the average grade of the planter or the top of the curb in a depressed planter or sloped side of a planter.  
(iv) 
Trees. All trees must be planted with a minimum 1.5” caliper tree for deciduous trees and coniferous trees must be a minimum height of 4 feet at the time of planting. 

(v) 
Ornamental grass shall be of a species that in every growing season has a height that exceeds 24 inches.  Grasses that are typically less than 24 inches in height and are intended for groundcover are categorized as decorative grasses. Turf or lawn grasses are groundcover and are not classified as decorative grasses. The landscape plan shall specify the size of grasses at the time of installation and shall be of a size to reach their maturity within one growing season. 

(vi) 
Plant materials must be installed to current nursery industry standards. Plant materials must be properly supported to ensure survival. Support devices such as guy wires or stakes must be adequately marked and must not interfere with vehicular or pedestrian movement. 


(vii) All required planters, bufferyards, and islands must include living groundcover. Foundation planters may use inorganic or non-living materials for ground cover. Organic mulch may be used in lieu of living ground cover beneath or around shrubs and trees. 
(E) 
Tree Spacing and Placement Trees must be planted with recognition of the space needs for eventual growth and maturity. Small to medium trees may be planted no closer than 10 feet to a building. Larger trees require a minimum spacing of 15 feet from a building.  Trees are to be located within and along parking lots in a manner that does not include parking lot lights within 15 feet of the tree to the extent practicable.  Medium and large trees can be planted as close as 20 feet from another similarly sized tree on the same site.  Large and medium sized trees must be planted a minimum distance of 3 feet from edge of paving. All spacing measurements are on center for the tree. 

(F)
  High Screen Dissimilar Use Transition and Parking Screen. Generally, the high screen landscape standard provides physical and visual separation between uses and improvements. 

(i)
  Required Landscape Elements. High shrubs shall be installed at a maximum distance of 6 feet on center to form a dense screen with a minimum mature height of 6 feet. In addition, one Landscape Tree is required per 50 lineal feet of landscaped area. Ground cover plants must fully cover the remainder of the landscaped area.  The high shrubs must be at least 4 feet in height at the time of installation. 

(ii) 
Alternatively, a 6-foot high fence with the fence posts on the interior side unless the fence is finished on both sides may be substituted for some or all of the high shrubs.  When a 6-foot high fence is installed, high shrubs shall be planted at the rate of one shrub or 3 ornamental grasses per 20 lineal feet. In lieu of shrubs, additional ornamental trees may be approved by the Planning Director. An existing fence that is in good condition and repair may be utilized to meet the fence requirement with a condition that replacement or repair of the fence is the obligation of property that requires fence to meet their High Screen requirement. 

(G) Industrial Screen and Wall (Former L4) Screen between Industrial and Residential Areas. 

(i) 
Generally.  The industrial screening standard is intendedtobe used in special instances where extensive screening of both visual and noise impacts is needed to protect abutting uses in areas where there is little space for separation.  These buffers must be designed and installed to separate activity areas of a site from the surroundings. Areas behind buildings with no outdoor activity areas or openings do not require walls unless necessary to enclose other activity areas on the site. 

(ii) 
Required Landscape Elements.  The L4 standard requires an 8-foot-high masonry (but not non-decorative concrete block) wall along the interior side of the landscape area.  One Landscape Tree is required per 50 lineal feet of wall.  In addition, 3 high shrubs or 6 low shrubs are required per 30 lineal feet of wall.  Ground cover plants must fully cover the remainder of the landscaped area. 


(iii) Alternative Compliance. The L4 standard can be met alternatively for sites that provide a minimum of 30 feet of separation from the property line to the use of the site by providing a berm with a minimum height of 4 feet with coniferous shrubs placed on the slope of the berm with an aesthetically pleasing density and coniferous trees planted within 10 feet of the berm. Landscaped trees shall also be provided at 1 tree per 50 linear feet. 
(H) F1, Partially Sight-Obscuring Fence. 
(i) 
Generally:  The F1 fence standard provides a tall, but not totally blocked, visual separation. The standard is generally applied where a low level of screening is adequate to soften the impact of the use of development or where visibility between areas is more important than a total visual screen.  It is generally applied in areas where landscaping is not necessary and where nonresidential uses are involved. 

(ii) 
Construction Standards.  Fences mustbe 6 feet high and at least 50% sight-obscuring.  Fences may be made of wood, metal, bricks, masonry or other permanent materials. 

(I) F2, Fully Sight-Obscuring Fence. 

(i) 
Generally.  The F2 fence standard provides a tall and complete visual separation and is primarily intended to be used in special instances where complete screening is needed to protect abutting uses and landscaping is not practical.  It is usually applied in nonresidential situations. 

(ii) 
Construction Standards.  Fences must be 6 feet high and 100% sight-obscuring.  Fences may be made of wood, metal, bricks, masonry or other permanent materials. 

(J) Alternative Design Approvals 

(i) 
Major Site Development Plan and Special Use Permits. A landscape plan prepared by a licensed Landscape Architect with alternative design and plantings may be approved under the requirements of a major site development plan after review and approval by the City Council when found to address the purposes of the ordinance and provides for a unique or high quality landscape environment that exceeds the quality of the base standards. 


(Ord. No. 4375, 11-27-18) 
(ii) A use subject to approval of a Special Use Permit may include a landscape plan prepared by a licensed Landscape Architect with alternative design and plantings for review and approval by the Zoning Board of Adjustment when the proposed plan is found to address the purposes of the ordinance and provides for a unique or high quality landscape environment that exceeds the quality of the base standards. 
(Ord. No. 4375, 11-27-18) 
(iii) Zoning districts, such as CSC, DSC, NC, and F-VR, with front yard building setbacks less than 15 feet do not require approval of a variance to tree planting types, tree spacing, or reduced front yard landscaping 
when approved by the Planning Director. The Planning Director may approve planting of required trees as street trees in these circumstances. 
(iv) 
The Planning Director may approve an alternative landscaping plan for unique conditions related to site constraints and topography that achieve necessary screening and aesthetic purposes of the landscape standards. The Planning Director may not approve reductions in landscaping based solely upon existence of existing vegetation on an adjacent site. 

(v) 
Upon installation, minor irregularities in planting and spacing may be accepted by the Planning Director. 

(K) 
Detention Ponds and Landscaped Areas Detention ponds must be unfenced and contain decorative landscaping elements such as tiered retaining walls, decorative rock features and plantings to be eligible to be counted toward base zone landscape percentage. The area of normal water height shall not count toward the base zone requirements. For ‘wet’ detention ponds or retention ponds the area of normal water height shall not count towards the base zone landscape percentage. 


(Ord. No. 4329; 12-12-17) 
(L) 
The Department shall not approve any landscape plan submitted to it pursuant to this section unless the plan conforms to the requirements of this section or conforms to an approved Master Plan or a Major Site Development Plan which the City Council or Special Use Permit approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment has determined meets the purposes described in Section 29.403. 
(Ord. No. 4329; 12-12-17; Ord. No. 4375, 11-27-18) 
(M) No surface parking lot shall be constructed, enlarged or reconstructed (excluding paving overlay) until a Parking Lot Landscape Plan for that surface parking lot has been approved by the Department of Planning and Housing. Reconstruction of a parking lot shall be subject to conformance with this ordinance pursuant to 29.307(5)(B). 
(Ord. No. 4329; 12-12-17) 
(N) Surface Parking Lot Landscape Plans shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with these provisions and the provisions contained in section 29.1502(3), “Minor Site Development Plan”. A parking space striping or site landscape plan that includes no new construction may be submitted pursuant to 29.403 (5)(C)(2). 
(Ord. No. 4329; 12-12-17) 
(4) CVCN and CGS District Landscaping. 
In addition to (and in conjunction with) the High Screen landscaping requirements specified in Section 29.403, increased landscaping shall be provided around the perimeter of parking lots that serve, or partially serve, Grocery Stores and/or any category of Retail and Shopping Centers as listed in Table 29.406(2), as follows: 
(A) 
For every 1 square foot of grocery store or shopping center gross floor area, 0.28 square feet of landscaping shall be provided. 

(B) 
Landscaping shall be contiguous to parking lot landscaping otherwise required by this Chapter, or in landscaped areas abutting parking lots that are at least 350 square feet in area, and which are no narrower than 10 feet in any dimension. 

(C) 
The area of increased landscaping required under this Section shall conform to the L1, General Landscaping requirements of Section 29.403. 

(D) 
All remaining areas of the site that are not otherwise covered by site improvements such as parking areas, driveways, buildings or parking lot landscaping shall be landscaped under the standards listed in Section 29.403. 


(Ord. No. 3967, 9-9-08; Ord. No. 4029, 4-13-10) 
(5)
 ADMINISTRATION. 

(A) 
Maintenance of Landscaping 
The property owner shall maintain required landscaping in a healthy and vital condition. The property owner shall 
permit and support the full maturity of required landscaping, including allowing for trees to reach their mature 
height and canopy size by not prematurely pruning, removing, “topping,” or by other means discourage the growth 
and health of vegetation. 


Dead or unhealthy vegetation shall be removed and replaced consistent with the standards of this ordinance. In kind replacement is required within 60 sixty days of removal of dead or unhealthy landscaping. 

(B)
 Failure to maintain landscaping and planters consistent with the standards of this ordinance is a violation of the Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may require replacement landscaping at larger installation sizes as corrective action to improper landscaping maintenance or removal, in addition to the provisions of Article XVI. 

(C) Removal of Landscaping 

(i) 
Property owners shall not remove existing vegetation that is consistent with an approved Site Development Plan that may no longer be required under the current standards without providing for a whole site review that includes replacement landscaping consistent with all new standards. For example, although side yard buffering is not required in many commercial areas there are additional parking lot landscaping requirements that would need to be addressed with a new landscaped plan before trees could be removed and have a compliant overall site. Existing trees and shrubs cannot be removed without addressing how replacement landscaping that is consistent with current requirements in terms of quantities, areas, quality, and types, will be added to a site to address current landscaping requirements. Approved Special Use Permits must be amended by the Zoning Board of Adjustment if existing vegetation is proposed to be removed and replaced. 

(ii)
 Modifications to landscape plans may be submitted for Planning Director approval as a site landscape plan rather than as a Site Development Plan. However, if there are changes to the planting areas that affect stormwater management or are in conjunction with other changes to the site, a Minor Site Development Plan is required. The Planning Director shall prescribe the landscape plan application requirements for modifications to existing landscaping. The Planning Director may approve a modified landscape plan for existing sites when the overall landscaping planting plan is consistent with the intent of the ordinance for overall site landscaping of parking lots, yards, and screening and the modified plan is determined to not diminish the landscape qualities of the site. 

(D) Installation and Inspections 

(i) 
Landscaping shall be installed commensurate with the overall construction and phasing of a site. Site Development Plan approvals may include conditions to facilitate planting of vegetation during the first phase of construction for larger projects. 

(ii) 
Prior to requesting occupancy of a building or actual use of a site, whichever occurs first, the property owner or applicant must submit a report verifying that required planter requirements for soil quality and conditions comply with the ordinance. 


(iii) All required landscaping materials, both living and non-living, shall be in place prior to 
the time of issuance of a final Certificate of Occupancy. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may grant a temporary 
Certificate of Occupancy for use of a site or building when the property owner has agreed to complete the 
required plantings within 60 days of the request for occupancy or by October 1st, whichever would occur 
first. The Planning Director may authorize deferral of landscaping plantings for a specified period of time 
due to adverse weather conditions and subject to the posting of a cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit 
in an amount equal to one and one-half times the estimated cost of the landscaping. Posting of financial 
security for completing landscaping does not relieve the property owner from installing and maintaining 
landscaping in accordance with the standards of this ordinance. 

(iv) The property owner may be found to be in violation of the Zoning Ordinance at any time once the initial delay for installation has been expired, whether a financial security has been provided or a Certificate of Occupancy has been finaled by the Building Official. 
(Ord. No. 4329; 12-12-17) 
(6) Alternate Landscape Standards for Automotive and Marine Craft Trade Uses. 
As an alternative to non-residential landscaping standards found in Section 29.403, the following standards may be applied to sites developed for automotive and marine craft trade as defined in Article 5; 
(A) Landscaped area between parking lot pavement and property lines. 
(i) 
Minimum Landscape Width – 20 feet along all property lines abutting public right-of-way lines, 10 feet along all other property lines along a zoning boundary, and 5 feet along all other property lines of properties within the same zone, landscaped as follows: 

(a) 
5 feet of the landscaped setback shall be landscaped with 1 overstory tree every 50 linear feet and with one shrub or a cluster of 3ornamental grasses planted 4 feet on center, with the balance landscaped according to subsection (d) below; or 

(b) 
Landscaped according to a standard of 9 shrubs per 1,000 sq. ft. of area and with 1 overstory tree every 50 linear feet and up to 50% of the required shrubs which may be substituted with ornamental grasses at a 3 grasses to 1 shrub ratio. The standards, except that required numbers of trees and shrubs may be strategically clustered to allow visual openings into the site.  Trees and shrubs must be clustered in regular intervals within required landscaped areas, spaced no greater than 200 feet apart.  Each cluster shall include no less than 3 trees spaced no greater than 15 feet apart (center to center) with the trunk of at least 1 tree in the cluster located within 8 feet of the parking lot edge (to ensure some shading of abutting pavement).  


Because landscaping under these options are less effective at softening impacts of lighting common to parking areas, all outdoor lighting shall conform to the following regulations: 
1. 
Lighting in sales display parking lots is limited to 15 foot candles average, with a maximum 90 foot candles at a point on a 10 X 10 foot grid; except that after 10:00 p.m. lighting shall be reduced to 2 foot candles average with a maximum 6 foot candles at a point on a 10 X 10 foot grid.* 

2. 
Lighting in non-display parking lots (e.g., customer parking, employee parking, storage areas) is limited to 2 foot candles average with a maximum 6 foot candles at a point on a 10 X 10 foot grid.* 

3. 
All lighting fixtures shall be shielded in such a manner that the lenses of the fixtures are not visible from public rights-of-way. 


* Photometric layouts to utilize mean lumen output of light source design. 
(ii)     Setback areas beyond the minimum setbacks shall be fully landscaped applying the landscape element ratios of (b) above at 50% of the required shrubs. 
(Ord. 4137, 1-8-13) 
(B) Landscaping around perimeter of all principal building facades visible from a public street. 
(i) Minimum landscape area equivalent to 5 feet times the length of each visible facade. 
(ii) Building perimeter landscaping may be reduced or eliminated along selected areas of the perimeter if an equivalent amount of landscaped area is added to other areas of the building’s perimeter, provided that perimeter areas of increased landscaping are along building facades visible from public rights of way. 
(iii) Up to 25% of the required landscaped area may consist of either a brick-paved surface, or a raised sidewalk/pedestrian area consisting of either brick pavers or colored and pattern-stamped concrete. 
(iv) 
Landscaping shall consist of 1 tree per 50 feet of building facade, and 1 shrub for every 6 feet of building facade.  Plants and trees may be clustered as desired.  

(C) 
Landscaped Entry Feature.  A landscaped entry feature shall be provided that consists of either a landscaped sidewalk or driveway extending from the right-of-way providing primary vehicular access to the site, to within 20 feet of at least one principal building on the site.  The landscape entry feature shall consist of the following: 

(i) 
A 5 foot wide landscape strip on each side of the sidewalk or driveway.  Said landscaping shall extend either: 

(a) The full length of the required landscape entry feature; or 

(b) 
At least 50% of the length of the landscape entry feature, provided that the entire length and width of the entry feature consists of a color-contrasted brick paved surface. (Colored and pattern-stamped concrete may be used for walkway areas, but will not suffice in areas of vehicle travel due to its poor color retention over time). 

(ii) 
Landscaping in the entry feature shall consist of 1 shrub or tree for every 40 square feet of landscaped area.  Shrubs may be low-lying to maximize visibility through the landscaped area. 

(D) 
Additional landscaping requirements. In addition to the minimum landscaping areas and plantings described above, the balance of all setbacks, landscape areas, and other portions of the site not otherwise developed with pavement, buildings, stormwater facilities and/or protected environmentally sensitive areas, shall be landscaped with lawn or groundcover plants (e.g., Sweet Woodruff, Ajuga/Bugleweed, Candytuft, Periwinkle, Vinca, Hosta, Carpet Juniper, prairie wildflower mix, etc.), and additional shrubs, flowers and trees as desired.  Ground covers shall be typed, spaced and sized to provide at least 75% coverage within a three-year period. Within this context, Lawn means a managed area of grass forming a continuous turf mowed and maintained at a low and consistent height, and that is generally free of weeds, sedges, and invasive or volunteer plants or grasses. 

(E) 
Large sites. For sites 3 acres or larger, all of the above landscape provisions apply. For sites less than 3 acres, the applicant may eliminate either the building perimeter landscaping of subsection (b) above, or the landscaped entry feature of subsection (c) above. 


(Ord. No. 4119, 7-10-12)(Ord. No. 4312, 6-27-17) 
Sec. 29.404.  ON-SITE SIDEWALKS. 
(1) 
General Standard.  An on-site sidewalk shall connect the street to the main entrance of the primary structure on the site, except those located in the Agriculture Zone.  Sidewalks shall be composed of concrete, brick or other masonry pavers and shall be at least 5 feet wide, except for those leading to Single Family and Two Family Dwellings, Community Residential Facilities, and Single Family Attached Dwellings, which shall be no less than 4 feet wide.  Where sidewalks cross driveways, parking areas and loading areas, the crossing shall be clearly identifiable, through the use of striping, elevation changes, speed bumps, a different paving material or other similar method.  The primary sidewalk leading to the main entrance of the primary structure on the site shall be lighted, except for such sidewalks leading to Single Family and Two Family Dwellings, Community Residential Facilities and Single Family Attached Dwellings. 

(2) 
Corner Lots.  On corner lots, sidewalks are only required between the main entrance of the primary structure and one street. 


Sec. 29.405.  OUTDOOR DISPLAY AND STORAGE. 
The extent to which the outdoor display of goods and outdoor storage are allowed is set forth in the individual Zone Development Standards Tables.  Any outdoor display of goods and outdoor storage permitted shall be in accordance with the following standards: 
(1) Outdoor Display of Goods. 
(a) 
Outdoor displays may not interfere with pedestrian or automobile traffic on adjacent public rights-of-way and may not interfere with the enjoyment or operation of adjacent properties and uses. 

(b) Outdoor display areas must comply with all applicable setback requirements for buildings. 

(c) 
Auto and Marine Craft Trade outdoor display areas shall only be established on sites that comply with front yard landscaping requirements of 29.403 (1) or (5). 


(Ord. No. 4329;12-12-17) 
(2) Outdoor Storage. 
(a) Outdoor storage areas must comply with all applicable setback requirements for buildings. 
(b) 
Outdoor storage areas shall count toward maximum building coverage limitations listed in the Zone Development Standards Tables. 

(c)

(d) 
No materials or wastes shall be stored or deposited upon a lot in such form or manner that they may be transferred off the lot by natural causes or forces. 


Sec. 29.406.  OFF-STREET PARKING. 
(1) 
Applicability.  The off-street parking requirements set forth in this Section apply to all off-street parking uses, whether required by this Ordinance or in excess of the requirements of this Ordinance; whether accessory to the principal use of a site, or operated as a commercial enterprise. 

(2) 
Required Parking Spaces.  Off-street parking spaces must be provided in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth in Table 29.406(2) below, for any new building constructed and for any new use established. 

(a) 
The off-street parking space requirement for a use not specifically mentioned herein is the same as required for a use of similar nature. 

(b) 
Whenever a building or use lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance, May 1, 2000, is enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or otherwise to create a need for an increase of 10% or more in the number of required parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of such enlargement or change. 

(c) 
The Planning Director may reduce required parking for non-residential uses by 10% in order to increase landscape area within parking lots that exceed 30 or more spaces. 


(Ord. 4312, 6-27-17; Ord. No. 4329, 12-12-17)

(3) 
Computation of Parking Spaces.  For purposes of computing the minimum required parking spaces pursuant to Section 29.406(2), the following rules apply: 

(a) When computing parking spaces based on floor area, areas used for parking are not counted. 

(b) 
When parking is required on the basis of square footage, gross square shall be used to calculate parking unless otherwise stated. 

(c) 
Where calculations yield a fractional result, fractions of 0.5 or greater shall be rounded to the higher whole number. 

(4) 
Occupancy of Structures Requiring Off-Street Parking.  All required parking and loading areas must be completed and landscaped prior to occupancy of any structure.  If landscaping cannot be completed due to 


weather or time of year, an agreement in a form prescribed by the Department of Planning and Housing shall be signed by the developer, which shall specify the completion date. 
(Ord. No. 4312, 6-27-17) 
(5) Use of Required Parking Spaces.  Required parking spaces must be maintained for the duration of the use requiring the spaces.  Required spaces shall be used exclusively for the temporary parking of passenger motor vehicles or light trucks and must be available for the use of residents, customers, and employees of the use requiring the parking spaces.  Fees may be charged for the use of required parking spaces.  Required parking spaces for one site may not be assigned in any way to a use on another site unless such assignment is made under an approved Joint Use Parking Plan, the requirements for which are set forth in Section 29.406(17).  Required parking spaces may not be used for the parking of equipment, the storage or display of goods, or the storage or repair of inoperable vehicles. 
(6) Proximity of Parking to Use.  Required parking spaces for residential uses must be located on the lot containing the principal building and cannot be more than 500 feet from a main entrance to the structure for which the parking is provided.  Except when valet parking is provided pursuant to Section 29.406(7), required parking spaces for non-residential uses must be in parking areas located not more than 1,000 feet from a main entrance to the structure served by the parking.

A Building/Zoning Permit required by Section 29.1501 shall not be issued until the plan is submitted and approved. 

(b) 
Front yard parking is permitted on commercial or industrial sites unless prohibited by the base zone standards. 


(Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00, Ord. No. 3660, 4-23-02; Ord. No. 3822, 3-8-05;Ord. No. 4312, 6-27-17; Ord. 4329;12-12-17) 
(c) 
The use of the front yard for the location of vehicular parking is permitted in the "S-HM" district only, but only if setbacks of 15 feet from the front lot line and 10 feet from the side lot lines are maintained with respect to the front yard parking area, and a landscaped berm is installed and maintained in said setback areas. The landscaped berm shall be so designed, constructed and maintained as to help screen from view from the front and sides, any and all motor vehicles parked on the parking lot in any season of the year.  Unless a parking lot plan is submitted pursuant to Section 29.1502, a Surface Parking Lot Landscaping Plan to meet the standards of Section 29.403(4)(f) shall be submitted to and approved by the Director of Planning and Housing (to be evidenced by a written document singed by both the property owner, or owner's agent, and the said director) prior to any construction, reconstruction, installation, erection, conversion, alteration, addition, enlargement or development of any structure, improvement, feature or aspect of the premises.  No Building/Zoning Permit required by Section 29.1501 shall be issued until the plan is submitted and approved as aforesaid. 

(i) 
Parking in the front yard pursuant to this subsection shall be permitted as stated only with respect to a totally new building constructed on the site.  Such parking shall not be permitted if there is on the subject premises any building or part of a building that was occupied or used for any purpose whatsoever prior to the effective date of the subsection or prior to the desired establishment or expansion of such front yard parking. 

(ii) 
This subsection shall apply to any expansion or increase in the area of the front yard used for parking, even if no other conversion, construction or change to the subject premises occurs.  Wherever this subsection applies, the subject parking area shall be so constructed and maintained as to meet or exceed the surfacing standards set out in Section 29.406(11). 

(d) 
For Group Living uses in any “RL,” “RM,” “RH,” “UCRM,” “FS-RL,” or “FS-RM” zone, no parking shall be permitted between the primary façade and the street on an interior lot.

On a corner lot, no parking is allowed between the street and any secondary façade. 


(Ord. No. 4205, 1-13-15) 
(e) Under no circumstances shall vehicular parking be permitted in the front yard of any Household Living or Short Term Lodging uses in any "RL", "RM", "RH", "UCRM", "FS-RL", or "FS-RM"  zones, except upon a driveway that leads to the side or rear yard or to an attached garage; and, one parking space is permitted in the front yard in the case where there is an existing, one car attached garage and there is insufficient room between the side of the attached garage and the side property line.  Such space shall meet the following requirements:  
i) The parking space shall not exceed nine (9) feet in width; 
ii) The parking space shall be contiguous to and parallel to the existing driveway; and, 
iii) The parking space shall be located between the existing driveway and the side property line. 

There shall be no installation at grade of any expanse of asphalt, concrete, gravel, brick, or other form of paving by any material whatsoever without the written authorization of the Zoning Enforcement Officer.  Such authorization shall be granted only if under the facts and circumstances of the particular situation it is unlikely that the paving will facilitate the use of the front yard, or any part thereof, for the parking of vehicles, except on a driveway as stated. 
(Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00; Ord. No. 3675, 8-27-02; Ord. No. 4205, 1-13-15). 
(f) 
For one and two family dwellings with access only from either Grand Avenue, Thirteenth Street, Duff Avenue, or Lincoln Way, and located on a segment of one of those streets where the Public Works Department can confirm an average weekday traffic count of not less than 12,000 vehicles per day, there may be a paved area appended to the driveway as a space in which a motor vehicle can be turned around to avoid backing onto the street. The dimensions of the said turning space shall be no greater than reasonably convenient to that purpose. The dimensions and configuration of that space shall be approved in writing by the Department of Planning and Housing prior to construction. A Building/Zoning Permit per Section 29.1501 shall be required for installation of the turn-around. 

(g) 
As used in this section, front yard means the open space in that portion of a yard between the street and the face of the structure and a line originating from the left side of the lot and extending to the right side of the lot. The line, as viewed from the street, shall extend parallel to the street to the nearest corner of the principal structure and then along the face of the principal structure to the right corner, and from that point on a line parallel to the street to a point on the right lot line. As used in this section, the face of a principal structure shall be any and all portions of the structure fronting on a street. The front yard shall not include any portion of the city right-of-way. A corner lot shall be deemed to have two front yards. 


(Ord. No.4205, 1-13-15) 

(8) 
Stacked Parking.  Stacked or valet parking is allowed by Special Use Permit if an attendant is present to move vehicles.  If stacked parking is to be used for required parking spaces, a covenant must be filed on the City land records obligating the property owner to have an attendant available at all times that the lot is in operation.  The requirements for minimum spaces and all parking area development standards continue to apply for stacked parking. Stacked parking of two parking spaces is permitted as of right for single family owner occupied land use. 

(9) Parking Space and Vehicle Aisle Dimensions. 

(a) 
Smaller parking spaces for small cars are allowed only when the parking lot involved consists of 10 or more off-street parking spaces.  These parking spaces shall be at least 8 feet wide and 16 feet long.  No more than 20% of the required off-street parking spaces shall be designated for small cars.  All small car spaces shall be clearly identified with signs or markings. In computing the number of permitted small car spaces where a fractional number of spaces results, the number of permitted small car spaces shall be rounded to the next lowest number. 

(c) 
If the degree of angle of parking provided is not listed in Figure 29.406(9), the aisle width required shall be the next largest angle of parking shown in Figure 29.406(9).  In circumstances where a strict application would result in unnecessary practical difficulties, the Zoning Board of Adjustmentmay,after notice and hearing, authorize such specific, limited exceptions to the above table of dimensions as it shall find warranted and consistent with: 

(i) adequate space for maneuvering of trucks, vans and full-sized passenger vehicles. 
(d) No exceptions shall be allowed for any other feature of these off-street parking rules. 

(e)

(Ord. No. 4100, 01-10-12) 
(15) Standards for Accessible Parking Spaces. 
(a) 
Signage.  Accessible Parking Spaces must be marked with above-grade signs with white lettering against a blue background and must bear the words "Handicapped Parking: State Permit Required" and "Violators Will Be Fined."  The sign must also bear the international symbol of access.  For parking spaces required to be van-accessible, a sign bearing the words "Van-Accessible" must be mounted below the symbol of accessibility.  Signs must be positioned so that they are observable from the driver's seat and cannot be obscured by a vehicle parked in the space. Whenalso allowed underfederaland state law, Accessible Parking Spaces serving dwelling units are exempt from this subsection unless a dwelling unit in the building being served is occupied by an individual eligible for a state permit. This exception shall not apply to any visitor parking areas for residential structures or parking areas serving accessory facilities for residential structures. 

(b) Width of Accessible Parking Spaces and Passenger Access Aisles. 
(i) Spaces.  Accessible Parking Spaces must have a minimum width of 8 feet. 

(ii) 
Passenger access aisles.  Except for spaces required to be van-accessible, all Accessible Parking Spaces must be served by passenger access aisles with a minimum width of 5 feet. 


(iii) Van-accessible spaces.  One in every 8, but not less than one, required Accessible Parking Spaces must be served by a passenger access aisle with a minimum width of 8 feet and must be designated "Van-Accessible" by a sign mounted below the symbol of accessibility. 
(iv) Combined width of space and passenger access aisle. Irrespective of the minimum widths for spaces and passenger access aisles set forth above, the combined width of the space and passenger access aisle for all Accessible Parking Spaces may not be less than 13 feet. 
(Ord. No. 4100, 01-10-12) 
(v) Accessible Spaces and Passenger Access Aisles must meet parking, setback and minimum landscaped yard requirements. 
(Ord. No. 4312, 6-27-17) 
(c) 
Additional Requirements for Passenger Access Aisles.  Passenger access aisles must be painted in cross-hatching and must be part of an accessible route to the entrance of the building or facility being served.  In parking facilities that do not serve a particular building or facility, passenger access aisles must be part of an accessible route to an accessible pedestrian entrance of the parking facility. 

(d) 
Vertical Clearance.  All Accessible Parking Spaces and at least one vehicle access route to and from all Accessible Parking Spaces must have a minimum vertical clearance of 8 feet 2 inches. 

(e) 
Location.  Accessible Parking Spaces serving a particular building shall be located on the shortest accessible route of travel from adjacent parking to an accessible entrance.  In parking facilities that do not serve a particular building, Accessible Parking Spaces shall be located on the shortest accessible route of travel to an accessible 

pedestrian entrance of the parking facility.  In buildings with multiple accessible entrances with adjacent parking, Accessible Parking Spaces shall be dispersed and located closest to the accessible entrances. 

(16) 
Relationship of Accessible Parking Space Requirements to Federal and State Law.  In addition to the requirements set forth in Sections 29.406(8) and 29.406(14), federal and state laws contain requirements and specifications for parking spaces accessible to disabled or handicapped persons.  Property owners and operators of uses on property have the responsibility of determining their compliance with federal and state laws, as those laws may from time to time be amended.  To the extent that federal or state laws contain standards which are more stringent than those contained in this Ordinance, state and federal law shall control. 

(17) Joint Use Parking. 

(a) 
Where 2 or more uses on the same or separate sites are able to share the same parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different times, the same parking spaces may be counted to satisfy the off-street parking requirements for each use upon the approval of a Joint Use Parking Plan by the City Council.  Applications for Joint Use Parking Plan approval shall include: 

and that the parking area will be large enough for the anticipated demands of both uses. 

(iv) 
A legal instrument such as a joint use parking agreement, a lease, an easement or a deed restriction that guarantees access to the parking for both uses, designates the time periods under which each use will have rights to count spaces for purposes of the space requirements under Section 29.406(2), and places restrictions on the hours of operation of each use. 

(b) 
Approval of Joint Use Parking. The City Council may approve an application for Joint Use Parking if it finds that: 

(i) 
The analysis provided presents a realistic projection of parking demands likely to be generated. 

(ii) 
Peak demand is sufficiently distinct so that the City Council is able to clearly identify a number of spaces for which there will rarely be an overlap of parking demand. 

(iii) Rights to the use of spaces are clearly identified so as to facilitate enforcement. 

(18) 
Remote Parking.   All parking spaces required by this ordinance shall be located on the same lot as the use served, except as noted below: 


(i)  The names and addresses of the uses and of the owners or tenants who will share the  
parking.  
(ii)  The location and number of parking spaces to be shared.  
(iii)  An analysis showing that the peak parking times of the uses occur at different times  

(a) Parking spaces required for principal uses permitted in the DSC, CSC, HOC, CCN, CCR, NC, S-HM and S-SMD zoning districts may be located on the same lot as the principal building or on a lot within 300 feet of the lot on which the principal building is located. (Ord. No. 4060, 4-26-11; Ord. 4372, 10-23-18) 
(b) Parking spaces required for uses permitted in the F-PRD zoning district may be located on a lot within 300 feet of the lot on which the use is located, if the parking spaces to be used are within the boundary of the same F-PRO zoning district. (Ord. No. 4060, 4-26-11) 
(c) Parking spaces required for principal uses permitted in the PRC zoning district may be 
located on any PRC zoned lot governed by and fully encompassed by the same site development plan. 
(d) For any remote parking, a written agreement in a form provided by the City shall be 
executed by the property owner or owners and the City to assure that these remote parking spaces are retained for the principal use. This agreement shall be recorded and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the property or properties involved. (Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00; Ord. No. 3606, 1-23-01; Ord.

(ii) 
The legs of the triangle are based on the posted speed limit of that street. A street with a posted speed limit of greater than 30 miles per hour shall have a 100 foot leg. A street with a posted speed limit of up to and including 30 miles per hour shall have a 50 foot leg. 


(iii) The length of any leg shall be halved if the street has a control feature, such as a stop sign, yield sign, or traffic signal. 
(b) Within the visibility triangle, no obstruction is allowed that would significantly obstruct or impede vision through the visibility triangle between a height of 3 feet and 10 feet above the grade of the curb or pavement edge (if there is no curb). Examples of obstructions include: 
(i) 
any fence, wall, shrub, berm, or sign taller than 3 feet. 

(ii) 
any evergreen tree.

Sec. 29.411.  OUTDOOR LIGHTING CODE. 
(1) 
The provisions of Division II, Sections 29.411, of the Zoning Ordinance may be referred to as the Outdoor Lighting Code.  These regulations are intended to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting.  It is intended to eliminate problems of glare, minimize light trespass, and help reduce the energy and financial costs of outdoor lighting by establishing regulations which limit the area that certain kinds of outdoor-lighting fixtures can illuminate and by limiting the total allowable illumination of lots located in the City of Ames, Iowa. All business, residential, and community driveway, sidewalk, and property luminaires should be installed with the idea of being a "good neighbor", with attempts to keep unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting properties or streets.  A purpose of the Outdoor Lighting Code is to set standards for outdoor lighting so that its use does not interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of property within the City.  It is an intent of the Outdoor Lighting Code to encourage lighting practices that will reduce light pollution by reducing up-light, glare, and over lighting. 

(2) Definitions.  For the purposes of Section 29.411, terms used shall be defined as follows: 

(a) 
Direct Light: Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire. 

(b) 
Fixture:  The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or some of the following parts:  a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens. 

(c) 
Fully-shielded lights:  outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that no light rays are emitted by the installed fixture at angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report. 

(d) 
Glare: Direct light emitted from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to cause visual discomfort, eye fatigue, a reduction in a viewer’s ability to see, or in extreme cases momentary blindness. 

(e) 
Grandfathered luminaires:  Luminaires not conforming to this Outdoor Lighting Code that were in place at the time this Outdoor Lighting Code went into effect. 

(f) Lamp:  The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light. 

(g) 
Light Trespass:  The shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located. 

(h) 
Lumen:  A unit of luminous flux.  One footcandle is one lumen per square foot. For the purposes of these regulations, the lumen-output values shall be the initial lumen output ratings of a lamp. 

(i) Luminaire:  This is a complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture. 

(j) 
Outdoor Lighting:  The night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means. 


(3) Regulations. 
All public and private outdoor lighting installed in the City of Ames, Iowa shall be in conformance with the requirements established by the Outdoor Lighting Code. 
(4) Control of Glare – Luminaire Design Factors. 
(a) 
Any luminaire with a lamp rated at more than 1800 lumens shall not emit, in its installed position, any direct light above a horizontal plane through the lowest direct light emitting part of the luminaire. 

(b) 
Any luminaire with a lamp rated at more than 1800 lumens, shall not emit in its installed position any more than 5% of its total light output in the zone from 10 degrees below the horizontal to the horizontal plane through the lowest direct light emitting part of the luminaire. 


(Ord. No. 4046, 9-28-10) 
(5) Exceptions to Control of Glare. 
(a) 
Any lighting source producing 1800 lumens or less shall be exempt from the Outdoor Lighting Code. 

(b) 
All temporary emergency lighting needed by the Police or Fire Departments or other emergency services, as well as all vehicular luminaires, shall be exempt from the requirements of the Outdoor Lighting Code. 

(c) 
All hazard warning luminaires required by Federal regulatory agencies are exempt from the requirements of the Outdoor Lighting Code. 

(d) 
A building or structure that has been designated for historic preservation by the City of Ames, State of Iowa, or the National Park Service, shall be exempt from the “fully shielded” requirements, if an historic restoration cannot be achieved by other means. 

(6) Outdoor Advertising Signs. 

(a) 
Lighting fixtures used to illuminate an outdoor advertising sign shall be mounted on the top of the sign structure. All such fixtures shall comply with the shielding requirements of Section 29.411(4).  An exception to this requirement may be allowed for ground mounted, monument signs. Ground mounted, monument signs may be illuminated with a ground mounted or a bottom mounted lighting fixture, provided that the light output shall be directed totally to the monument sign surface to prevent up-lighting and glare. 

(b)  
Outdoor advertising signs of the type constructed of translucent materials and wholly illuminated from within do not require shielding.  Dark backgrounds with light lettering or symbols are preferred, to minimize detrimental effects. 


(c) Electrical illumination of outdoor advertising off-site signs between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 
6:00 a.m., shall only be done by means of lights directed downward.

RESIDENTIAL 

Sec. 29.700. RESIDENTIAL BASE ZONES. 
(1) Purpose. The Residential Base Zones established by this Ordinance are: 
(a) 
Residential Low Density (RL); 

(b) 
Residential Medium Density (RM); 

(c) 
Urban Core Residential Medium Density (UCRM); 

(d) 
Residential High Density (RH); and 

(e) 
Residential Low Density Park (RLP). 


Each of these zones is designed and intended to establish the priority of residential uses by prohibiting uses detrimental to residential neighborhoods and allowing, through Special Use Permit, with regulation of design, scale, and location, only those nonresidential uses that support and give vitality to residential life.  The residential Base Zones differ on the basis of density, predominant housing type, and range of nonresidential uses. The differentiation among the residential Base Zones is designed and intended to provide for variety in the size and density of residential neighborhoods and to allow for a range of affordability in each housing type. 
(2) 
Use Regulations. Use regulations for all the Residential Base Zones are set forth in the following Use Tables: RL Zone, Table 29.701(2); RM Zone, Table 29.702(2); UCRM Zone, Table 29.703(2); RH Zone, Table 29.704(2); and RLP Zone, Table 29.705(4). 

(3) 
Residential Density.  In each Residential Base Zone, residential development must be in accordance with the Residential Density standard established for that zone. Residential Density is expressed in terms of the square feet of lot area required per dwelling unit. Residential Density varies by zone. The number of dwelling units that may be built on a given lot is a function of two factors: the lot size and the Residential Density of the Zone. The density of a development shall not exceed the density limits hereby established for Residential Zones as follows, or as specified in an Adaptive Reuse Plan approved by the City Council. 


(Ord. No. 4154, 7-16-13) 
(a) 
Low-Density Residential (RL) - no more than seven and twenty-six hundredths (7.26) dwelling units per net acre. 

(b) 
Urban Core Residential Medium Density (UCRM) - no more than seven and twenty-six hundredths (7.26) dwelling units per net acre. 

(c) 
Residential Medium Density (RM) - at least seven and twenty-six hundredths (7.26) but no more than twenty-two and thirty-one hundredths (22.31) dwelling units per net acre. 

(d) 
Residential High Density (RH) - at least eleven and two tenths (11.2) dwelling units per net acre but no more than thirty-eight and fifty-six hundredths (38.56) dwelling units per net acre."

SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS 

Sec. 29.1000.  SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS. 

 (1) Purpose. Each Special Purpose District will appear on the City's Zoning Map as a Base Zone. The Special Purpose Districts are intended to further the goal of creating a new vision for the City, including the planning and management of growth; provisions for developable areas; a sense of place and connectivity; cost effectiveness and efficient growth patterns; mobility and alternative transportation; and economic expansion and diversification. The Special Purpose Districts are designed to allow for new development that is consistent with existing land use patterns in scale, type and density. 
 (2) Establishment.  The Special Purpose Development Districts established by this Ordinance are: 
(a) 
Hospital/Medical Design District (S-HM); 

(b) 
Government/Airport District (S-GA); 


Sec. 29.1001.  "S-HM" HOSPITAL/MEDICAL DESIGN DISTRICT.
 (1) 
Purpose.  The intent of the Hospital/Medical Design District is to allow for typical uses associated with a hospital, including outpatient diagnostic and surgical centers and special treatment facilities that involve extended stay to be permitted around existing hospital-medical uses. This District recognizes that medical offices benefit from being close to hospitals. However, expansion of the hospital and medical offices has involved displacement of several residences. There is general incompatibility between the nature and scale of the hospital operation in the surrounding residential neighborhood. This Special Purpose District is designed to accommodate the hospital's primary functions through further intensification of the present site. This District attempts to promote compatibility where hospital and residential uses interface. Compatibility provisions include parking provisions, landscaping buffers and minimizing the impact of lighting.

 (2) 
Use Regulations. The uses permitted in the Hospital/Medical Design District are set forth in Table 29.1001(2) below:

Sec. 29.1004  "DGC" DOWNTOWN GATEWAY COMMERCIAL 
The Downtown Gateway Commercial Zoning District (DGC) is established to implement the vision and objectives of the Lincoln Way Corridor Plan and more specifically for the Downtown Gateway Focus Area. 
The City of Ames finds that implementation of the DGC will facilitate redevelopment of the area consistent with the objectives of the Lincoln Way Corridor Plan and create new commercial retail, entertainment, and office uses that are a compliment to the Downtown area north of the Gateway Area. The Gateway Area is a commercial redevelopment area intended to promote an enhanced streetscape, commercial uses complimentary to the broader Downtown area with retail, entertainment, and employment, and in some situations the addition of mixed use residential development.  
It is the purpose of the provisions of this Zoning District to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and define development procedures for obtaining the objectives of the Lincoln Corridor Plan with redevelopment of property within the District.  
1. Development Process 
Development or redevelopment of site is required to conform to this Chapter and the procedures of Article XV. The approval process within the District has been modified to address site size and the types of uses permitted on each site. A Building Design Conformity finding is required with all Site Development Plans, in addition to the criteria of 29.1502. Major Site Development Plan review is required for mixed-use development. Mixed-use residential development requires a Major Site Development Plan to ensure the primary purpose of commercial development is accomplished in conjunction with the addition of housing. The Major Site Development Plan grants additionally flexibility for the configuration of a site and for the arrangement of uses. No Major Site Development Plan for Mixed-use development shall be approved that does not specify appropriate commercial tenant space sizes, orientation, and total square footage in a project. An appropriate mix of commercial and residential development will be evaluated on case-by-case basis to ensure a mixed-use project fulfills the redevelopment goals of the Lincoln Way Corridor Plan for commercial first redevelopment that incorporates community commercial uses and uses that are complimentary to Downtown.
 (a) Standard Site A standard site is defined as any site that that is less than one acre in net lot area or as a site that exceeds one acre in net lot area that does not include Household Living Mixed Use. A standard site may be developed or redeveloped consistent with the zone development standards. A standard site review process consists of approval of a 
Sup. 2018-3 Chapter 29, Article 10 - 9 Rev. 7-1-18 

Zoning/Building Permit, Minor Site Development Plan or Special Use Permit, as applicable to the principle use and scope of the development or redevelopment project. A standard site may be approved for a plat of survey or subdivision consistent with the standard lot zone development standards.  
 (b) Redevelopment Intensification Site A Redevelopment Intensification Site is an optional designation requested by a property owner for a site that meets either of the following two thresholds: 
i. 100 feet of Kellogg Avenue street frontage, or 
ii. A minimum net lot area of one (1) acre and 100 feet of street frontage. A Redevelopment Intensification Site designation allows for approval of Household Living Mixed Use development in addition to the other allowed uses of the zoning district. A Redevelopment Intensification Site is subject to a Major Site Development Plan approval and allowing for additional design flexibility.  
(Ord. No. 4355, 6-26-18) 
2. Use Regulations.  The uses permitted in this District are set forth in Table 29.1004(2) below.

5. Building Design Standards The following development standards apply to all projects subject to a Site Development Plan or Special Use Permit. The intent of the design standards is to promote high levels of architectural interest, enhancement of the pedestrian oriented streetscape, and to accommodate desirable commercial uses as the primary use within the District. Each proposed building shall undergo a design review for conformance to the applicable design standards and objectives for development within the District. Design review will be incorporated into the review of the Site Development Plan or Special Use Permit and require a finding that the proposed project includes conforming design elements that support a high quality building design with architectural interest and enhances the structures appearance in a manner that is compatible with both existing and planned uses adjacent to the site.   
 (a) 
Kellogg Avenue Frontage Buildings with facades along the Kellogg Avenue are intended to be designed in a manner that is compatible with the traditional look of Main Street and incorporate architectural elements that support the transition of the uses from Lincoln Way to Main Street. Buildings are required to consist of a minimum of two stories along Kellogg Avenue. Each building shall incorporate the following design elements into the design. 

i. 
Transparent windows at ground level. Glazing shall consist of a minimum of 40% to 50% of the façade area at the ground level. Commercial retail storefronts require higher levels of glazing than other uses. Glazing requirements apply along street frontages and to designated activity areas or plaza spaces. 


Sup. 2018-3 Chapter 29, Article 10 - 14 Rev. 7-1-18 

ii. Each tenant space shall have a pedestrian entrance that connects directly to the street.  Corner lots may be required to provide an entryway at a corner or to include two entries. 
iii. Minimum ground floor to ceiling height of 15 feet for all buildings. 
iv. 
Incorporate wall plane changes and variations in the façade to create visual relief along long facades, e.g. 50 feet of facade length. Incorporate store front pattern and rhythm similar to Main Street, e.g. 25 feet. 

v. Clay brick building materials for front and side facades. 

a. 
There is an exception for side facades obscured from view by an abutting building located within 5 feet of the property line.  

b. Accent materials may be approved in addition to the use of clay brick. 

c. 
Buildings with three or more stories may propose to incorporate a secondary façade material in addition to clay brick. 


vi. The building design shall include architectural details to create visual interest and design diversity, such as transoms, brick solider course, corbel, cornice, lintels, projecting window bays, inset windows, canopies, parapet variation. 
vii. Alternative high interest architectural building materials, such as stone, glass, steel, architectural metal panels may be approved in lieu of clay brick when approved with a Major Site Development Plan. 
viii. 
Rear facades may include materials other than clay brick that are compatible with the overall design of the building. 

ix. No balconies are permitted along the perimeter of a building adjacent to a street. 

x. 
Commercial floor area requires a minimum depth of 60 feet, minor variations allowed through Design Review. 


 (b) Other Street Frontages 
Buildings in areas without frontage along Kellogg Avenue may take on a variety of architectural appearances to meet the goals of the District for enhanced architectural design that creates visual interest and identity for the Lincoln Way Corridor. Buildings with facades along streets other than Kellogg shall incorporate the following design elements: 
i. Minimum ground floor to ceiling height of 15 feet. 
ii. Commercial floor area requires a minimum depth of 60 feet, minor variations allowed through Design Review. 
iii. Incorporate pedestrian entrances that lead directly to an abutting street. 
iv. 
Transparent windows at ground level. Glazing shall consist of a minimum of 30% to 50% of the façade area at the ground level.

v. 
Clay brick shall be used as a primary building material for front and side facades, unless alternative high interest architectural building materials are approved through a Major Site Development Plan review. 


vi. Incorporate wall plane changes and variations in the façade to create visual relief along long facades, e.g. 50 feet of facade length. 
vii. The building design shall include architectural details to create visual interest and design diversity, such as transoms, brick solider course, corbel, cornice, lintels, projecting window bays, inset windows, canopies and parapet variation. 
viii. Minimize the placement of balconies along Lincoln Way. When balconies are permitted along Lincoln Way, balconies shall not project more than 2-feet from the front primary building facade. Balconies may not project within 5 feet of the right-of-way. Drive-through facilities may require a covered pick-up window and street screen walls with compatible materials to the principal building.

(Ord. No. 3718, 7-22-03; Ord. No. 3818, 2-8-05; Ord. No. 3872, 03-07-06; Ord. No. 3889, 09-12-06; Ord. No. 4221, 6-23-15) 
(3) Applicability.  These zones are intended to function as an "overlay" to the underlying Base Zones, in addition to all of the use, yard, bulk and other requirements of the applicable Base Zone.  In each case, the most restrictive provision of the Overlay or the underlying Base Zone shall apply. The location of Overlay Zones shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map. 
Sec. 29.1101. "O-SFC" SINGLE FAMILY CONSERVATION OVERLAY. 
(1) 
Purpose.  The Single-Family Conservation Overlay (O-SFC) Zone is intended to conserve the existing single-family residential character of areas identified as O-SFC adjacent to the downtown.  The O-SFC is intended to protect single-family neighborhoods while guiding the transition to higher density and compatibility with the surrounding uses where intensification is permitted. The O-SFC is meant to help maintain the general quality and appearance of the neighborhoods; promote a more cohesive look to the neighborhoods; recognize the neighborhood characteristics as a major part of the City's identity and positive image; promote local design qualities; stabilize and improve property values; reduce conflicts between new construction and existing homes; and allow a limited amount of increased housing densities. 

(2) 
Definitions.  See Section 29.201 of this Ordinance. 

(3) 
Findings.  The O-SFC is based in part on the findings that: 



(a) 
Conservation of older residential areas continues to provide a broad range of housing choices; 

(b) 
Conservation of architecturally significant structures adds to the distinctiveness of a neighborhood and encourages a sense of "place"; 

(c) 
The downtown is strengthened by the existence of healthy residential neighborhoods nearby; 

(d) 
The existing single-family residential character can be conserved while guiding the transition and compatibility where intensification is permitted; and 

(e) 
Standards that encourage in-fill development, retain the values of surrounding development and protect the City's unique character will promote stable neighborhoods. 

(4) Permitted Uses. 

(a) 
Subject to the Building/Zoning Permit requirements of Section 29.1501, land, buildings and structures may be used for the following purposes in an O-SFC Zone without City Council approval, in accordance with standards and regulations of the Base Zone: 

(i) 
Dwelling -Single-Family 

(ii) 
Dwelling – Two Family 



(b) 
All uses and structures conforming to the Base Regulations and all lawfully vested nonconforming uses and structures that exist in the O-SFC on the effective date of the amendment of the official zoning map to show the O-SFC are hereby deemed to be conforming with the terms of this Section.  The O-SFC shall not be deemed to create a nonconforming use or structure within the scope of Section 29.307. 

(5) 
Site Development Plan Review.  In the O-SFC, there shall be no construction of a new multifamily building or any addition to an existing multifamily building or to a nonconforming building whether vested or not until after Plan approval is granted pursuant to the provisions contained in this Section and Section 29.1502(4), unless exempted by Section 29.1101(4)(a) above. Approval decisions under this Section 29.1101 for sites located in a Historic Preservation District shall be made by the Historic Preservation Commission. For sites in the O-SFC but not in a Historic Preservation District, Site Development Plan approval decisions shall be made by the City Council. 

(6) 
Intensification Limited.  In the O-SFC the maximum number of dwelling units, of any kind defined in Section 29.201, shall not at any time be permitted to exceed 648. Additionally, in the O-SFC, apartment dwellings shall not be permitted unless the plans for the project meet the following standards: 

(a) 
The existing infrastructure must be sufficient to support the proposed project at the time of application, or sufficient infrastructure shall be provided as a part of the proposed project. "Sufficient infrastructure" includes water distribution, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, fire protection, streets and transportation, refuse collection, greenway connectors and/or sidewalks; 

terms of scale and character of the architectural elements; and 

(d) 
Any yard that abuts another residential Zone, dwelling unit type or density shall be not less than the corresponding front, side, or rear yard requirement of the adjacent district, dwelling unit type or density. 

(7) 
Bulk Regulations. Land, buildings and structures used in the O-SFC shall comply with the lot area, lot width, and yard requirements as provided in the Base Regulations. 

(8) 
Landscaping, Screening and Buffer Areas. Landscaping, screening and buffer areas shall be provided in accordance with Section 29.403.

(h) 
Windows. Windows shall have a width-to-height ratio of 2:3. This requirement shall only apply to the primary facade, front facing recessed facades, and the secondary facade.  In addition, an exception will be made for decorative windows, gable windows, or a single large window where the interior floor plan contains a space where such a window type would be expected. 

(i) 
Entrances.  There shall be an entrance with a porch or stoop on the primary facade of any new structure.  This entrance shall face the street and be accessible by means of a paved walkway.  No more than one entrance shall be placed on any primary or recessed facade. 

(j) 
Porches.  Where a porch is constructed, the porch shall have a depth of not less than 6 feet, and shall extend a minimum of 50% of the width of the facade to which it is attached.  Porches shall not be enclosed by walls, windows, or solid doors and shall not exceed 10 feet in height measured from the floor of the first story to the roof line. 

(k) 
Stoops.  A stoop shall be of a width not greater than 30% of the width of the facade to which it is attached and shall be of a depth not less than 4 feet.  Stoops shall not be enclosed by walls, windows, or solid doors and shall not exceed 10 feet in height, measured from the floor of the first story to the roof line.  The roof of a stoop that is supported by brackets shall project from the building a minimum depth of 4 feet. 

(l) 
Foundations. Substantial foundation plantings shall be required to screen the base of the primary and secondary facade of any new building.  The first floor elevation shall be constructed a minimum of one and one-half feet above grade.  Grade shall be determined at the high point of the sidewalk that is located in the public right-of-way parallel to and abutting the front of the lot.  In addition, ground-mounted mechanical units shall be screened with plantings. 

(m) 
Orientation.  Structures shall be situated at right angles with the street. Primary facades shall be parallel with the street to which they front.  Buildings shall be oriented perpendicular to the front facing 

of 24 feet and 38 feet. Any portion of the building that is wider than the primary facade shall be recessed from the primary facade a distance of not less than 8 feet. A second primary facade will be permitted, provided that it is separated by a recessed facade that conforms to the minimum facade width of 24 feet. 

(p) 
Height.  No structure shall be constructed or remodeled to a height greater than 3 stories or 40 feet, whichever is lower. 

(q) 
Lot Configurations. Lots in the O-SFC shall remain configured as they are on the date that the O-SFC regulations go into effect.

Section 29.1113. LINCOLN WAY MIXED USE OVERLAY DISTRICT. 
(1) 	Purpose. The intent is to allow for multi-family housing that may not be accommodated in other zones and to promote Lincoln Way as a commercial destination along a multi-modal transportation corridor. The Lincoln Way Mixed Use Overlay supplements the base zone regulations of areas along the Lincoln Way corridor zoned Highway Oriented Commercial “HOC” between Duff Avenue and South Dakota Avenue by allowing for a mixed commercial/residential 
Sup #2017-3 Rev. 7-1-17 Chapter 29, Article 11-20 
use option.  This Overlay preserves the primary use of the corridor for commercial uses while allowing for another housing option for the City of Ames residents and promotes high quality architectural design and compatibility with the City’s desired enhancement of the character for Lincoln Way. 
(2) 	
Permitted Uses. Subject to the requirements of Sec. 29.1502 for Site Development Plan Review, and in accordance with the requirements of this Sec. 29.1113 and the Zone Development Standards of the HOC base zone, Apartment Dwellings may be permitted in combination with HOC permitted uses classified as Office Uses; Retail Sales and Services Uses; Entertainment, Restaurant, and Recreation; and miscellaneous use of childcare.  Stand alone Apartment buildings are not a permitted use in the Overlay Zone. 

(3) 	
Site Development Plan Review. All mixed use projects, in combination with a zoning application for the establishment of the Mixed Use Overlay, shall apply for a Major Site Development Plan review per Section 29.1502. 

(4) 	
Distinction Between Design Standards and Design Principles. The Design Standards are mandatory requirements set forth to meet the purpose of the Overlay. Design Principles are intended to guide the design components of a mixed use project and act as a framework to consider the project’s consistency with the Overlay’s purpose for commercial use and promoting high quality design features and architecture.  In some instances, development may be required to exceed the minimum standards and principles as part of the Major Site Development Plan review. 

(5) 	
Design Standards. The following design standards are the minimum requirements necessary to implement a mixed use project in the Overlay. 

(a) 	
Building Height. Buildings within the overlay district shall not exceed three-stories and shall not exceed 42 feet. 

(b) 	
Floor Area Ratio. The maximum ratio for a project within the overlay shall not exceed a 1.0 floor area ratio. 

(c) 	
Minimum Commercial Area of the Building(s). A minimum of 75% of the lineal length of the front facade of all buildings, as visible from Lincoln Way, shall be commercial uses. 

(d) 	
Orientation and Front Yard Setback Encroachment. Mixed use buildings shall be oriented to Lincoln Way with a visual connection of commercial store fronts to the street. A front yard setback encroachment of 10 feet may be permitted for pedestrian oriented design features of architectural projections, arcades, patios, etc. 

(e) 	
Parking. No parking shall be permitted between the buildings and the street. Parking requirements must be consistent with Article 4 of Chapter 29. 

(f) 	
Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required from the commercial entrance(s) of each building to the public right of way. Sidewalks shall also be provided for the connection of multiple buildings when more than one structure is constructed on a site. 

(g) 	
Floor to Ceiling Height. Ground floor uses shall have a high floor to ceiling height, generally of a minimum of 12 feet measured from top of commercial floor to the bottom of the next floor structure. 



(6) 	
Design Principles. The following design principles shall be guidelines relied upon when considering the site and architectural design components of a mixed use overlay project: 

(a) 	
Building design should recognize site patterns and help define entries to the interior of the site, commercial spaces, residential building entrances, and public spaces.  The 

project design shall embrace pedestrian friendly design principles recognizing Lincoln Way as multi-modal transportation corridor.  Designs that allow for and promote active outdoor space for commercial uses are desirable. 

(b) 	
Preference will be for commercial areas to be located parallel to Lincoln Way. 

(c) 	
Use architectural styles that promote a commercial appearance to a development with strong visual connection to Lincoln Way. Commercial storefronts shall have a high percentage of glazing. 

(d) 	
The architectural design shall utilize a variety of forms to create diverse elevations. Residential units, office and commercial/retail spaces shall overlook the street and interior areas. Buildings should include green building techniques minimizing sun impacts of heat gain and glare for south facing windows. 

(e) 	
The materials used in design of the buildings should utilize quality materials that include a mix of clay brick /masonry and contemporary uses of woods and metals as materials to accentuate and create interest on the building.  The principle cladding materials of buildings as viewed from the street and commercial entrances shall be clay brick or stone materials. 

(f) 	
The use of color, textures, and/or patterns should be used to accentuate the quality of the architectural design and materials of the building. 

(g) 	
The layout of commercial floor area on the ground floor shall define the design of the overall building rather than maximizing residential density. 

(h) 	
The commercial Floor Area Ratio for the property should meet a minimum 0.15 floor area for the site. 

(i) 	
Commercial area design should account for customary dimensions and needs for a variety of retail, restaurant, and office uses. Generally, a minimum of 50 feet of depth and a maximum of 100 feet of depth is appropriate for 1st floor “inline” type commercial space. 

(j) 	
Residential unit access should be separate from commercial tenant access. 

(k) 	
Locate residential access in clearly identifiable and well lit locations. 

(l) 	
Parking should be provided in excess of minimum retail parking rates to provide a variety of commercial tenant options, including restaurant uses with higher parking rates, rather than maximizing parking areas for apartment units. Encourage developments to incorporate prominent bike parking.

(1) Purpose. Suburban Residential development is intended to accommodate contemporary development patterns similar to development in the past 20 to 30 years. The F-S Suburban Residential is an alternative to the Village Residential zone that is provided for in Section 29.1201 of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00) 
(2) 
Suburban Residential Development Principles. Property that is developed according the F-S requirements shall create a development pattern that adheres to the following development principles: 

(a) 
A development pattern that contains generally distinct and homogeneous land uses to occur in the remaining in-fill areas and the targeted growth areas where Village Residential development is not selected by the property owner. 

(b) 
An economic and efficient subdivision design with respect to the provision of streets, utilities, and community facilities with limited focus on building and development design integration and a greater emphasis on vehicular mobility; 

(c) Effective landscaped buffers between distinctly different land uses. 

(d) 
The provision of common open space in residential areas where the maintenance of the open space is the responsibility of those directly benefitting. 

(e). A development pattern that ensures compatibility in the design of buildings with respect to placement along the street; spacing and height of building and provides for spaciousness, and effective vehicular and pedestrian circulation; 

(f) 
A development pattern that is compatible with surrounding neighborhoods and is consistent with the Goals and Objectives of the Land Use Policy Plan. 


(Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00) 
(3) 
Establishment. The F-S is hereby established and applies to all lands that are rezoned to F-S on the Zoning Map. A Zoning Map Amendment as described in Section 29.1507(2) may be approved provided the City Council makes the following findings: 

(a) 
The designation is consistent with the Land Use Policy Plan; 

(b) 
The development complies with all requirement of Section 29.1202 as stated herein; 



(c) 
The existing infrastructure system to be utilized by the land proposed to be zoned F-S has the capacity to support the development contemplated; 

(d) 
The designation and contemplated development of the land proposed to be zoned F-S has been selected by the property owner as an alternative to the F-VR zoning designation.

(c) 
Prohibited Home Occupations.  No person will be allowed to operate prohibited home occupations. 

(3) Criteria. All home occupations must meet the following criteria: 
(a) Area to Be Used. 

(i) 
The activity shall be conducted in a manner that will not alter the normal residential character of the premises, or in any way cause a nuisance to adjoining residents, nor shall there be any structural alteration to accommodate the occupation.  There should be no emission of smoke, dust, odor, fumes, glare, noises, vibration, electrical or electronic disturbances detectable at the lot line that would exceed that normally produced by a single residence.  Special noise exceptions will be allowed for day care homes due to the nature of the clients using the facility. 

(ii) 
The activity shall be located within the principal building or within an accessory structure.  It shall occupy no more than 25% of the total floor area of the residence and shall not exceed 400 square feet of an accessory building. Exception:  For family day care homes, the entire dwelling unit may be used to serve the various needs of day care (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, napping rooms, play areas, etc.). However, the day care can provide care to no more than one person per 35 square feet of the total dwelling unit, exclusive of baths, hallways, closets, kitchens, and dining areas. The dining area may be included in the square footage calculation if used by day care participants for activities other than meals. 


(Ord. No. 4101, 01-10-12) 
(b) 
Signs. Any sign utilized at the home occupation shall be limited to one flush-mounted sign on the main residential structure, which shall not exceed one square foot in area. Such sign shall not be lighted and nonreflecting materials shall be used. The legend shall show only the name of the occupant and the type of occupation. Color shall be consistent with the residential character. 

(c) 
Equipment.  There shall be no mechanical equipment used except as customary for domestic household purposes. Any merchandise or stock in trade sold, repaired or displayed shall be stored entirely within the residential structure or in any accessory building.  No storage is to be visible from lot lines. 

(d) 
Employment.  The activity shall employ only members of the household residing in the dwelling unless approval for the employment of up to two (2) non-family members is granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. 

(e) 
Traffic.  The activity shall not generate significantly greater traffic volumes than would normally be expected in a residential area.  Not more than 10 vehicular visits per day shall be allowed. An exception to the number of visits allowed per day may be permitted for family day care homes and adult day care due to the number of children or adults allowed on-site and the need for parent or caregiver contact during the day.  The delivery and pick up of materials or commodities to the premises by commercial vehicles shall not interfere with the delivery of other services to the area. 


(Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00) 
(f) Parking Criteria. 
(i) 
Only one delivery vehicle associated with the activity may be parked on the street near the premises for not more than 4 consecutive hours.

(Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00) 
(g) Class Size.  If the home occupation is the type in which classes are held or instructions given, there shall be no more than 4 students or pupils at any given time.  The Board may approve up to 6 students if it finds that the additional students will not generate additional traffic.  Day-care homes may have up to 6 children or adults at a time. Additional children or adults will require a Special Home Occupation Permit for a day-care center. 
(Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00) 
(h) 
Number of Home Occupations.  The total number of home occupations within a dwelling unit is not limited, except that the cumulative impact of all home occupations conducted within the dwelling unit shall not be greater than the impact of one home occupation.  This will be determined by using the home occupation criteria. 

(4) 
Family Day Care in Multifamily Dwellings. In addition to the criteria of Section 29.1304(3), Family Day Care in multifamily dwellings shall comply with the following additional criteria.

The Board's action shall be based on stated findings of fact. The conditions imposed shall be construed as limitations on the power of the Board to act.  A mere finding that a use conforms to those conditions or a recitation of those conditions, unaccompanied by specific findings of fact, shall not be considered findings of fact for the purpose of complying with this Ordinance. 

(a) 
General Standards.  The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall review each application for the purpose of determining that each proposed use meets the following standards, and in addition, shall find adequate evidence that each use in its proposed location will: 

(i) 
Be harmonious with and in accordance with the general principles and proposals of the Land Use Policy Plan of the City; 

(ii) 
Be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be harmonious in appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and that such a use will not change the essential character of the area in which it is proposed; 


(iii)  Not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future uses in the same general  
vicinity;  
(iv)  Be served  adequately by essential  public  facilities  and  services  such  as  

highways, streets, police, fire protection, drainage structure, refuse disposal, water and sewage facilities, and/or schools; 
(v) 
Not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities and services; 

(vi) 
Not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment or conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person, property or general welfare by reason of excessive production of 


traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, or odors; and 
(vii) Be consistent with the intent and purpose of the Zone in which it is proposed to locate such use. 
(b) 
Residential Zone Standards. The  Zoning Board of Adjustment shall review each application for the purpose of determining that each proposed use in a residential zone meets the following standards, as well as those set forth in Section 29.1503(4)(a) above and, in addition, shall find adequate evidence that each use in its proposed location will: 

(i) 
Not create excessively higher levels of traffic than the predominant pattern in the area and not create additional traffic from the proposed use that would change the street classification and such traffic shall not lower the level of service at area intersections; 

(ii) 
Not create a noticeably different travel pattern than the predominant pattern in the area.  Special attention must be shown to deliveries or service trips in a residential zone that are different than the normal to and from work travel pattern in the residential area; 


(iii) Not generate truck trips by trucks over 26,000 pounds g.v.w (gross vehicular weight) to and from site except for food delivery vehicles, waste collection vehicles and moving vans; 
(Ord. No. 4159, 9-24-13) 
(iv) Not have noticeably different and disruptive hours of operation; 
(v) 
Be sufficiently desirable for the entire community that the loss of residential land is justifiable in relation to the benefit; 

(vi) 
Be compatible in terms of structure placement, height, orientation or scale with the predominate building pattern in the area; 


(vii) Be located on the lot with a greater setback or with landscape buffering to minimize the impact of the use on adjacent property; and

(c) 
Commercial Standards.  The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall review each application for the purpose of determining that each proposed use located in a commercial zone meets the following standards as well as those set forth in Section 29.1503(4)(a) above and, in addition, shall find adequate evidence that each use in its proposed location will: 

(i) 
Be compatible with the potential commercial development and use of property planned to occur in area; 

(ii) 
Represent the sufficiently desirable need for the entire community that the loss of commercial land is justifiable in relation to the benefit; and 

(iii) Be consistent with all other applicable standards in the zone. 
(d) Special Use Permits for Functional Families. 

(i) 
Purpose. This Section is to provide for the regulation of Functional Families that may request to reside in a Single Family Dwelling, Two Family Dwelling or Single Family Attached Dwelling. The regulations are also intended to prohibit larger groups of unrelated persons from residing in Single Family Dwellings, Two Family Dwellings, or Single Family Attached Dwellings. Larger groups of unrelated persons have frequently shown to have a detrimental affect on Single Family neighborhoods since larger groups of unrelated persons do not live as a family unit and do not have significant economic or emotional ties to a neighborhood. 

(ii) 
Standards of Functional Families.  The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall review each application for a Special Use Permit for a functional family as provided for in this section after having determined that the application meets the following standards:

b. 
Members of the functional family are not legally dependent on others not part of the functional family; 

c. 
Can establish legal domicile as defined by Iowa law; 

d. 
Share a single household budget; 

e. 
Prepare food and eat together regularly; 

f. 
Share in the work to maintain the premises; and 

g. 
Legally share in the ownership or possession of the premises.” 



(e) 
Conditions.  The Board may impose such additional conditions as it deems necessary for the general welfare, for the protection of individual property rights, and for ensuring that the intent and objectives of this Ordinance will be observed. 


(Ord. No. 3591, 10-10-00; Ord. No. 3983, 2-10-09) 
(5) 
Lapse of Approval. All Special Use Permits shall lapse 12 months after the date of issuance unless the use is undertaken or a building permit has been issued and actual construction started.  Where unusual circumstances may prevent compliance with this time requirement, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may, upon written request by the affected permittee, extend the time for required start of construction an additional 60 days. Excavation shall not be considered construction for the purpose of enforcing this Section. 

(6) 
Successive Applications. In the event that the Board denies an application for a Special Use Permit, a similar application shall not be refiled for 12 months from the advertised public hearing date.  The Board, on petition by the applicant, may permit a refiling of this application after 6 months from the original hearing date when it determines that significant physical, economic or land use changes have taken place within the immediate vicinity, or a significant zoning ordinance text change has been adopted, or when the reapplication is for a different use than the original request. The applicant shall submit a detailed statement setting out those changes that he or she deems significant or upon which he or she relies for refiling the original application. 

(7) 
Site Plans approved as part of a Special Use Permit. All site plans approved as part of an approved Special Use permit may only be amended pursuant to the same procedures for approving Minor Changes to a Major Site Development Plan as provided in Section 29.1502(6).
