CHAPTER 2 - DEFINITIONS 
SECTION: 

1-2-1: - RULES OF CONSTRUCTION: 
Unless otherwise specifically defined in this code, terms used in this code shall have the meanings prescribed by the Illinois Compiled Statutes for the same terms.

B.  Bearing Burden Of Tax: In addition to providing that he did not owe the tax for which recovery is sought, the claimant must also prove that he bore the burden of the amount of such tax, either by not shifting the burden to the tax to anyone else in the first instance, or by unconditionally refunding any amounts passed on because of the tax to his customers, who bore the burden thereof.

E.  Refunds: In case the city council determines that the claimant is entitled to a refund, such refund shall be made only from such budgeted amount as may be available for that purpose.

The public body shall, promptly, either comply with or deny a written request for public records within five (5) business days after its receipt of the request unless the time for response is extended as provided below. Denial shall be in writing as provided in section 1-13-6 below. Failure to respond to a written request within five (5) business days after its receipt shall be considered a denial of the request. 
D.  The time limits prescribed in subsection C. above may be extended in each case for not more than five (5) business days from the original due date for any of the following reasons: 
1.  The requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations than the office having charge of the requested records; 
2.  The request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records; 
3.  The request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records responsive to it; 
4.  The requested records have not been located in the course of routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them; 
5.  The requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under section 1-13-5 below or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions; 
6.  The request for records cannot be complied with by the public body within the time limits prescribed by subsection C. of this section without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the public body; 
7.  There is a need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among two (2) or more components of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the subject matter of the request. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, a person making a request may agree in writing to extend the time for compliance for a period to be determined by the city and the requesting party. If the requester and the city agree to extend the period for compliance, a failure by the public body to company with any previous deadlines shall not be treated as a denial of the request for records. 
E.  When additional time is required for any of the above reasons, the city shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of the request, notify the person making the written request of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the response will be forthcoming. Failure to respond within the time permitted for extension shall be considered a denial of the request. 
F.  Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in the information. Before invoking this exemption, the public body shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions. If any body responds to a categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly burden its operation and the conditions described above are met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance will so burden the operations of the public body. Such a response shall be treated as a denial of the request for information. Repeated requests from the same person for the same records that are unchanged or identical to records previously provided or properly denied under this chapter shall be deemed unduly burdensome under this provision. 
G.  Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations in conformity with the provisions of this section pertaining to the availability of records and procedures to be followed, including: 
1.  The times and places where such records will be made available, and 
2.  The persons from whom such records may be obtained.

1-13-3: - INSPECTION OR COPYING OF PUBLIC RECORDS FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES: 
A.  A public body shall respond to a request for records to be used for commercial purposes with twenty-one (21) working days after receipt. The response shall: 
1.  Provide to the requester an estimate of the time required by the public body to provide the records requested and an estimate of the fees to be charged, which the public body may require the person to pay in full before copying the requested documents; 
2.  Deny the request pursuant to one or more of the exemptions set out in this chapter; 
3.  Notify the requester that the request is unduly burdensome and extend an opportunity to the requester to attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions; or 
4.  Provide the records requested. 
B.  Unless the records are exempt from disclosure, a public body shall comply with a request within a reasonable period of time considering the size and complexity of the request, with priority to records requested for non-commercial purposes. 
C.  It shall be unlawful for a person to knowingly obtain a public record for a commercial purpose without disclosing that it is for commercial purposes, if requested to do so by the public body.

4-2-12: - OUTDOOR SEATING LICENSE: 
A.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, it shall be unlawful for any liquor licensee to serve alcoholic liquor at an outdoor seating area without first obtaining a license, as provided herein. 
B.  An "outside seating area" means a privately owned outdoor location within the licensed premises for consumption on the premises, excluding any private parking area, where alcoholic liquor may be sold and consumed subject to the provisions governing outdoor seating licenses herein. 
1.  Such outdoor seating area may be allowed within certain Class B, C, D, or G licensed premises, as defined in this chapter, subject to the following conditions: Any outdoor area where alcohol is sold or consumed shall be enclosed or cordoned off by use of a fence or barrier which shall be not less than thirty-six (36) inches in height nor more than seventy-two (72) inches in height, and proved with required, unobstructed exits as prescribed herein and by the fire prevention code under the City Code. Such outdoor seating area shall be clearly designated with a permanent or semi-permanent fence and/or barrier consistent with the existing zoning and building ordinances of the City Code and as approved by the city. 
2.  The location of any outdoor seating area shall comply with all setback requirements in the applicable zoning district, shall not obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic and shall comply with all existing provisions of the City Code (adopted building, zoning and fire codes). 
3.  The authorized hours of operation of any outdoor seating area shall be the same as the permitted operating hours of the licensed premises. 
4.  A certified BASSET trained employee shall be responsible for the service of alcohol at the outdoor seating area. 
C.  An application is required for all outdoor seating licenses which shall include a detailed site plan showing all existing buildings, structures, fence or barrier openings, and objects on the property sought to be licensed, and the proposed location of each item to be placed within the outdoor seating area including, but not limited to, permanent or semi-permanent fences and/or barriers of a minimum of thirty-six (36) inches tall and a maximum of seventy-two (72) inches tall consistent with building and zoning provisions in this City Code. Partitions, chairs, tables, lighting, serving stations and other amenities included in the outdoor seating area shall be approved by the city. The outdoor seating area shall be maintained in compliance with the approved site plan. 
D.  An inspection of the outdoor seating area shall be made by the city prior to the issuance of an outdoor seating license. Inspections may include, but are not limited to, inspections by the building department, police department and fire department prior to issuance of the license. 
E.  The outdoor seating area shall be in compliance with all requirements of this City Code and all other applicable rules and regulations regarding the outdoor seating area. 
F.  Standards for Outdoor Liquor License Seating Area: 
1.  The total number of outdoor tables and seats shall not exceed the licensee's approved seating diagram as submitted in its application, and is dependent on the amount of space available and on the applicable building and fire regulations under the City Code. 
2.  In order to allow adequate pedestrian traffic areas and emergency access around outdoor dining areas, the following dimensional requirements must be observed: 
i.  A space at least thirty-six (36) inches wide for unobstructed ingress/egress must be maintained between any restaurant doorway and the pedestrian traffic corridor. 
3.  Barrier Designs. A variety of styles and designs are permissible for outdoor liquor license areas. 
i.  Sectional Fencing: sectional fencing (generally defined as rigid fence segments that can be placed together to create a unified fencing appearance) is a desirable solution for outdoor seating areas using barriers. Such fencing is portable, but cannot be easily shifted by patrons or pedestrians, as can less rigid forms of enclosures. Sectional fencing must be of metal (aluminum steel, iron, or similar) or of wood or composite construction. 
ii.  Rope or Chain Rails: Rope or chain-type barriers (generally defined as enclosures composed of a rope or chain suspended by vertical elements such as stanchions) are permitted if they meet the following guidelines: 
-  Rope/Chain Diameter: The rope or chain must have a minimum diameter of one (1) inch, in order to be identifiable by the visually impaired. 
-  Posts: Vertical support posts (stanchions, bollards, etc.) must be constructed of wood, metal (aluminum, steel, iron, or similar), or composite materials. 
-  Stanchion Base Must Not be a Tripping Hazard: If a stanchion or other vertical supporting device is attached to a base, that base must be adequate to support the station as approved by the city. No domed stanchion bases are permitted. 
iii.  Freestanding or Attached: Any barrier may be freestanding without any permanent or temporary attachments to buildings, sidewalks, or other infrastructure or may be attached to a building. 
iv.  Planters: Planters may be used in addition to or in place of other barrier designs. Planters and the plants contained within them must meet the following requirements: 
-  Maximum Height of Planters: Planters may not exceed a height of thirty-six (36) inches above the ground. (this pertains to the planter only, not the plants contained therein). 
-  Maximum Height of Plants: Plants (or seasonal displays of natural landscape material) may not exceed a height of seventy-two (72) inches above the level of the ground. 
-  Planter Material: All planters must have plants (live, artificial, or seasonal) contained within them. If the live plants within the planter die, the plants must be replaced or the planter removed. Empty planters with only dirt, mulch, straw, woodchips or similar material are not permitted. 
v.  Natural Barriers: Barriers may be natural in design such as a hedge, shrub or other plant materials approved by the city. 
4.  Prohibited Barrier Styles. 
i.  Fabric Inserts: Fabric inserts (whether natural or synthetic fabric) of any size are not permitted to be used as part of a barrier. 
ii.  Chain-link and Other Fencing: The use of chain-link, cyclone fencing, chicken wire or similar appurtenances is prohibited for the outdoor seating license. Materials not specifically manufactured for fencing or pedestrian control (including but not limited to such items as buckets, food containers, tires, tree stumps, vehicle parts, pallets, etc.) are not permitted and may not be used as components of a barrier. 
5.  Barrier Measurements. To ensure their effectiveness as pedestrian control devices and identifiable to persons with visual impairments, barriers must meet the following measurement guidelines: 
i.  Height: The minimum height for barrier designs is thirty-six (36) inches from the ground and maximum of seventy-two (72) inches with the exception of planters. However, planters may not exceed a height of thirty-six (36) inches above the ground. (This pertains to the planter only, not the plants contained therein.) 
ii.  "Open" Appearance: Fences or other perimeter enclosures with a height of between thirty-six (36) inches and fifty (50) inches and must be at least fifty percent (50%) open (see-through) in order to maintain visibility of street level activity. Any enclosure with a height over fifty (50) inches must be at least eighty percent (80%) open (see-through). Variances of the open appearance requirement will be granted for those outdoor seating licenses that have been issued and are currently on file with the city as of May 1, 2015. 
iii.  Maximum Distance from Ground: All barriers must be identifiable to visually impaired pedestrians. Therefore the bottom of barriers must be no greater than seventy-two (72) inches above the sidewalk surface. 
6.  Access Openings. 
i.  Minimum Access Width: Any access opening within the barrier must measure no less than thirty-six (36) inches in width. 
ii.  Location: Access openings should be placed in a location that will not create confusion for visually impaired pedestrians and as approved by the fire department. 
7.  The outside dining area must be kept sanitary, neat and clean at all times and in compliance with the Kane County Health Department. 
8.  The dining area must have adequate illumination during evening hours. 
G.  The issued license shall be posted in a conspicuous place inside the licensed premises. 
H.  All such sales and distribution of alcoholic liquor shall in all respects be in conformance with the class of license held by the liquor licensee. 
I.  The annual fee for an outdoor seating license shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00).

4-5A-2: - APPLICATION: 
A.  Upon the granting of a franchise under the city's cable television ordinance and prior to making any attachments to any city or joint pole, a grantee shall make application to the city, by and through its superintendent of electrical services, for a permit. The application to be submitted shall be substantially in the form as set forth on exhibit A, on file with the city clerk's office and made a part hereof by reference. In the event any proposed attachment shall be upon a joint pole, grantee also shall make application to Ameritech, its successor and assign, upon an application substantially in the form as set forth at exhibit D, on file with the city clerk's office and made a part hereof by reference and obtain such necessary consents or approvals from the Illinois commerce commission as may be required. 
B.  No attachment shall be made upon any city or joint pole unless grantee has first obtained a permit therefor, and in the case of a joint pole, a permit has been issued by both the city and Ameritech. 
C.  The city reserves unto itself, its successors and assigns, the right to deny an application if in the judgment of the city's superintendent of electrical services any attachment requested would unreasonably or adversely interfere with, or adversely impair, the city's electrical service or operations, including, but not limited to, safety of service or operations, economy of service and operations, infringement upon the rights of existing easements, rights of way or other public utilities. 
D.  All applications shall indicate grantee's specific requested locations of attachments of cables, wires or equipment necessary to accommodate any proposed attachment. Thereafter, the city shall indicate suggested replacements or rearrangements of poles, cables, wires and equipment and shall furnish an estimate of cost for any such replacements, additions, changes or rearrangements needed. Grantee shall pay, in advance and prior to the issuance of the permit, the city's estimated costs for city engineering expenses (including, but limited to, analysis, surveying, inspection of proposed cable routes, or any attendant drawings, specifications or estimates) which may be required for any proposed replacements, changes and rearrangements of the city's or Ameritech's poles and facilities required to accommodate grantee's attachments. In the event the estimates do not meet actual costs, grantee shall pay any difference to the city or receive repayment from the city based on the estimates as the case may be. 
E.  Prior to the issuance of any permit hereunder, grantee shall tender to the city a construction performance bond, with surety acceptable to the city, guaranteeing the complete and satisfactory performance of construction for any costs incurred by the city for the replacement or rearrangement of any city poles, cables, wires and/or equipment. The amount of such bond shall be not less than the city's estimate of cost as hereinabove provided. 
F.  Additionally, and prior to the issuance of any permit or permits, grantee shall furnish to the city a fidelity performance bond in the face amount required under the bond schedule which is on file in the city clerk's office and made a part hereof by reference. The terms of the bond shall provide for the payment of all sums which may at any time become due from grantee to the city, including, but not limited to, rental fees, inspection fees, work performed for the benefit of the grantee, or removal of attachments. The amount of such bond shall be determined based upon the number of city or joint poles to which grantee requests permission for attachment and the form of said bond shall be guaranteed by a surety acceptable to the city. In the event the number of poles utilized by grantee shall exceed the number of poles, city and joint, covered by a bond, grantee shall furnish such additional bond or bonds, with surety, to satisfy the requirements set forth in the aforesaid bond schedule. (1975 Code § 81/2-81)

B.  If, in the city's judgment, grantee's attachments can be accommodated on existing poles by way of rearrangement of the city's facilities, grantee shall reimburse the city for the cost of such rearrangement. 
C.  In the event that the city or Ameritech shall require the pole space occupied by grantee, and said pole has not been previously replaced for such purposes, then the provisions of section 4-5A-2 of this article shall apply with respect to notification, prior approval and reimbursement of costs, except that grantee may elect to remove its attachments from such pole if it does not approve such replacement pole. 
D.

Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult use entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
B.  Findings: There is no question that local governments have a substantial interest in preventing crime, maintaining property values and protecting retail trade, commercial districts, neighborhoods and quality of life for its constituents. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v.

1.  Adult use businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
2.  Certain employees of adult use businesses engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
3.  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at adult use businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
4.  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
5.  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adult use businesses. 
6.  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult use businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
7.  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982; 2,200 in 1983; 4,600 in 1984; 8,555 in 1985, 253,448 through 1992, and more than 1,000,000 in 2006. (Reported by KA Fenton, RO Valdiserri, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention (proposed, Center for Disease Control, June 2006.) 
8.  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in the state. 
9.  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with 355,991 cases being reported in 2007. (Reported by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, November, 2007) 
10.  In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
11.  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
12.  It has been reported that sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
13.  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of adult use businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, pg. 377 (1986). 
14.  The findings noted in subsections 1. through 13. raise substantial governmental concerns. 
15.  Adult use businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
16.  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult use businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the adult use business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult use business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
17.  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
18.  Requiring licensees of adult use businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior and prevent minors from working in such establishments. 
19.  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the adult use business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
20.  In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct. 
21.  The fact that an applicant for an adult use business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
22.  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult use businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
23.  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

Each situation will be evaluated on initial facts and supporting documentation as to the reasonableness of the waiver request as well as to ensure it is not contrary to the public interest. The "public interest" assumes that the interests of the citizens as a group will be protected, and does not refer to the wishes or unilateral viewpoint of the applicant for the waiver. If the applicant's situation and supporting documentation meet eligibility requirements for a waiver of the fee(s), they will be notified as to whether their request has been granted in part, in full, or denied, including an explanation of the reason for the decision.

Service of a violation notice shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. The original or a facsimile of a violation notice or, in the case of a violation notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record generated by the device showing the facts entered on the violation notice, shall be retained by the administrator, and shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of business. A violation notice issued, signed and served in accordance with this chapter and Section 11-208.3 of the Code, a copy of the violation notice or the computer generated record shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the violation notice. The violation notice, copy or computer generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceedings. 
B.  Before a citation may be issued for any automated traffic law violation, a determination must be made by a technician employed or contracted by the city that, based on inspection of recorded images generated by the system, the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6 of the Code or an ordinance of the city.

A person owing an unpaid fine or penalty for automated traffic law violation penalty may file a petition to set aside a final determination of such liability within ten (10) days after service by the city of a determination notice. Such a petition shall be filed by sending the same, together with any documentation in support thereof, to the administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery to the administrator. The grounds for such a petition shall be limited to: (a) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (b) the person having already paid the fine or penalty for the violation in question, and (c) excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. A hearing on such a petition shall be held within thirty (30) days after the filing of same. In the event that such a petition is granted upon a showing of just cause, and the subject determination of automated traffic law violation liability is thereby set aside, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for that violation.

Service of a suspension notice shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. 
B.  If the administrator provides a suspension notice to a vehicle owner and subsequently makes a certified report to the secretary, the subject vehicle owner may challenge the accuracy of the certified report in writing. To do so, the vehicle owner must submit to the administrator a written statement under oath, together with any supporting documentation, establishing one of the following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the certified report: (1) that the person was not the owner or lessee of the subject vehicle or vehicles receiving five (5) or more automated traffic law violations on the date or dates such violation notices were issued, or (2) that the person already paid the fines or penalties for the five (5) or more automated traffic law violations indicated on the certified report. Such statement and supporting documentation must be sent to the administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand-delivered to the administrator within five (5) days after the person receives notice from the secretary that that the person's driver's license will be suspended at the end of a specified period of time unless the secretary is presented with a notice from the city certifying that the fines or penalties due and owing have been paid or that the inclusion of the person's name on the certified report was in error.

9-2B-12: - INTERCONNECTION POLICY: 
A.  Subject to the conditions and requirements set forth below, the city shall make available, upon request, interconnection services to any retail electric customer that meets the guidelines set forth in this policy. Interconnection services in this policy refers to on-site small power generating facilities ("SPGF") connected to the city's electric distribution system ("utility system") in a manner that will allow excess electricity generated by the SPGF to be safely delivered onto the city's electric distribution system. 
B.  Guidelines for interconnecting to the utility system are as follows: 
1.  Only SPGF that have been approved by the city electric utility shall be interconnected with the city's electric distribution system. 
2.  Interconnection services shall only be available to SPGF with an aggregated total electric generation at a single customer site of less than one MW. 
3.  In order to assure the continuing safe, reliable service to all customers, the utility system must be concerned with the manner in which SPGF are connected to the utility system. The city's concerns are fourfold: 
a.  The SPGF must promptly disconnect from utility system in the event of a utility system disturbance; 
b.  The SPGF must disconnect from the utility system in the event of a malfunction or disturbance on the SPGF equipment; 
c.  The SPGF must not backfeed a de-energized utility system line; and 
d.  The SPGF must not significantly degrade the quality of service to other city customers. 
C.  All interconnections shall comply with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 1547 for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems (IEEE 1547) as may be amended from time to time. 
D.  The city is under no obligation to purchase energy supplied by a SPGF to the utility system under this interconnection policy; provided, however, the owner of the SPGF shall not be precluded from applying to the city to supply power under the net metering policy set forth at section 9-1A-18 of this Code. 
E.  If the retail customer qualifies under the provisions of this interconnection policy but does not qualify under the net metering policy, any energy delivered to the utility system shall be tendered to the utility system without credit or monetary payment to the retail customer. The city will install a meter at the point of delivery for the sole purpose of monitoring the energy load delivered by the SPGF and the retail customer shall thereafter be responsible for any costs associated with the maintenance and removal of the meter. 
F.  SPGF customers will comply with all other applicable utility standards for interconnection. Any inspections, reviews of plans, specifications and/or sites and any approvals, written or oral, conducted or provided by the city are solely for the use and purposes of the city and the city makes no warranty, direct or indirect, and provides no assurances, direct or indirect, as to the adequacy or safety of any plans, specifications, sites, installations or other characteristics of the SPGF. 
G.  Any SPGF with a capacity of ten (10) kW or less and interconnected to the utility system shall comply with IEEE 1547 section 5.5, periodic interconnection tests. All interconnection related protective functions and associated batteries shall be periodically tested at the expense of the retail customer at intervals specified by the manufacturer system integrator, or the authority that has jurisdiction over the distributed resources interconnection. Periodic test reports or a log for inspection shall be maintained. 
H.  SPGF greater than ten (10) kW shall perform all interconnection-related protective functions and associated battery testing on a yearly basis. All test reports shall be submitted to the city electric utility after completion of the yearly testing. 
I.  Reports required under subsections G. and H. of this section must be submitted to the superintendent of electrical services within thirty (30) days of the anniversary date of the energizing of the SPGF interconnection to the utility system. If the required reports are not received within the 30-day period, the generation must be disconnected until such time as the reports are submitted. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 1(Exh. A), 10-21-2013) 
9-2B-13: - NET METERING POLICY: 
A.  The city shall make available, upon request, net metering service, as defined below, to any retail customer receiving electric service from the city and who meets the requirements set forth in this section 9-1A-18. For purposes of this section, "net metering" means electric service to a retail electric customer where electric energy generated from the customer's eligible on-site generating facility (EOGF) and, under designated circumstances delineated below, is delivered to the utility system to offset electric energy provided by the utility system to the retail electric customer. 
B.  For purposes of this policy an eligible on-site generating facility shall be defined as a renewable electric generating facility such as a photovoltaic facility and small wind turbines. Other forms of renewable electric generation, such as sources fueled by landfill methane, fuel cells, or micro turbines fueled by renewable fuels shall be considered on a case by case basis. In all cases, SPGF must be deemed to be renewable to qualify for this policy. 
C.  In order to assure the continuing safe, reliable service to all customers, the utility system must be concerned with the manner in which SPGF are connected to the utility system. The city's concerns are fourfold: 
1.  The SPGF must promptly disconnect from utility system in the event of a utility system disturbance; 
2.  The SPGF must disconnect from the utility system in the event of a malfunction or disturbance on the SPGF equipment; 
3.  The SPGF must not backfeed a de-energized utility system line; and 
4.  The SPGF must not significantly degrade the quality of service to other city customers. 
D.  The electric generating facility must also comply with the city's interconnection policy of this chapter. Any inspections, reviews of plans, specifications and/or sites and any approvals, written or oral, conducted or provided by the city are solely for the use and purposes of the city and the city makes no warranty, direct or indirect, and provides no assurances, direct or indirect, as to the adequacy or safety of any plans, specifications, sites, installations or other characteristics of the SPGF. 
E.  Subject to the limitations set forth herein, city shall make net metering service available, upon request, to any city retail electric customer with a SPGF of ten (10) kW capacity or less. 
F.  A SPGF of ten (10) kW capacity or less shall retain exclusive rights to renewable energy credits (REC'S) generated by the SPGF. 
G.  Any SPGF with capacity greater than ten (10) kW but less than one MW shall be considered on a case by case basis. The decision with respect to such facilities shall be made by the superintendent of electrical services. 
H.  Total of all SPGF interconnected under this policy to the city utility system shall not exceed two percent (2%) of the utility system's peak demand as recorded during the prior calendar year. In the event that the utility system's peak demand is reduced such that the existing net capacity exceeds the two percent (2%) level, those existing net metered customers shall be allowed to continue under this policy. However, no new interconnections will be allowed until such time as the system peak grows such that net metered capacity is again no greater than two percent (2%) of the system's peak. 
I.  Energy generated by the EOGF will offset the energy required by the customer's load during the billing period. For any energy generated by the customer in excess of the energy required by the customer's loads for a given billing period a credit shall be carried forward to the customer's next billing period. Under no circumstances will there be monetary payments, or credit transfers for excess energy generated by EOGF. Accrued excess energy credits shall expire at the earlier of the (a) end of the current annual period, or (b) date that the retail customer terminates service under this policy. 
J.  A retail customer requesting service hereunder shall remain connected to the utility system for a minimum annual period. An annual period is a period of twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods that expire at the end of the retail customer's April monthly billing period. The annual period automatically renews at the expiration of the previous annual period unless the city is notified in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of the annual period that the provision of net metering to the retail customer is to be terminated at the expiration of the annual period. Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this subsection J., the initial annual period shall commence at the time the retail customer commences service hereunder and may include fewer than twelve (12) consecutive monthly billing periods. 
K.  Any costs incurred by the city associated with the net metering program, including but not limited to changes in metering (other physical facilities or billing-related costs) shall be borne by the retail customers in the net metering program.

9-3A-5: - SURCHARGE TO INDUSTRIAL USERS FOR DISCHARGE OF COMPATIBLE POLLUTANTS: 
A.  Application of the sewer use rate for the industrial user class determined in subsection A of section 9-2A-4 shall be based on the assumption that wastes discharged from industrial or trade practices as distinct from sanitary sewage have, as a minimum, the characteristics of normal domestic sewage thereby precluding "negative" or less than base charges for weak strength wastes. Normal domestic sewage is defined as containing two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) of five (5) day BOD, two hundred twenty milligrams per liter (220 mg/l) of suspended solids, and twenty milligrams per liter (20 mg/l) of ammonia nitrogen. 
The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as deemed necessary by the city and shall be binding as a basis for surcharges. Surcharges shall be levied on those wastes which, on the basis of the most recent samples, contain higher than normal concentrations of the abovementioned constituents. Approval of such discharge and the surcharge requirement shall be set forth in the user's wastewater discharge permit. The city shall notify, in writing, all dischargers of waste which is subject to said surcharges. 
B.  Users permitted to discharge compatible pollutants in excess of the stated limits shall pay a surcharge according to the following schedule: 
1.  Thirty-five cents ($0.35) for every pound of BOD discharged above the stated limits. 
2.  Thirty-four cents ($0.34) for every pound of TSS discharged above the stated limits. 
3.  Seventy-eight cents ($0.78) for every pound of Ammonia Nitrogen above the stated limits. 
The following formula shall be used for calculating the pounds of excess in the user's discharge: (actual concentration {mg/l} - Code Limit {mg/l})(8.34)(Volume of discharge) 
Volume of discharge shall be calculated in million gallons based on the consumption from the water meter or by agreement with the superintendent of water and wastewater with agreement detailed in a discharge permit. 
C.  Not less than annually, the city shall charge each industrial user for the expenses incurred by the city to review and examine the subject user's waters.

(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 1(Exh. A), 10-21-2013) 
9-3A-7: - METERS REQUIRED: 
A.  All premises served by the city waterworks shall be equipped, at the customer's expense, with a water meter specified by the superintendent, who shall read or cause to be read every water meter used in the city such as are necessary to ensure that bills are sent out on time. 
B.  The superintendent of water and wastewater and other duly authorized employees of the city, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all private properties which contain a water meter for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair, maintenance, or replacement of the water meter. 
C.  All appointments for the above purposes will be scheduled between the hours of 7:15 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Monday-Friday at no charge. An administrative fee of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) will be charged to the customers' utility account for appointments made after normal work hours or on a Saturday. 
D.  In the event access to the water meter is denied either by verbal notification or by no response to written notices, the superintendent of water and wastewater or duly authorized employees of the city may discontinue water service to the property. Water service to such property shall not be restored until such time as access to such property has been granted and water meter conditions have been corrected. In the event service is discontinued an administrative fee of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) will be charged. If service is reinstated on Saturday or Monday-Friday between the hours of 2:30 p.m. and 11:59 p.m., the administrative fee shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00), between the hours of midnight and 6:59 a.m., or a Sunday, or on a designated city holiday, the administrative fee shall be one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). All fees will be assessed to the utility account. Neither the city, the superintendent of water and wastewater, or its agents or assigns, shall be liable to any customer for any injury, damages or lost revenues which may result from termination of such customer's water supply in accordance with or without notice. 
E.  If a customer denies the city the ability to read the meter by radio signal, the monthly charge to manually read the meter will be seventy-five dollars ($75.00) and the charge will be placed on the utility account. 
F.  Upon receipt of a customer's written complaint that a city water meter is inaccurate the city shall: Remove the customer's water meter and test it for accuracy; except, however, that two-inch or larger meters shall be tested in place. If such testing determines that the water meter does conform to the American Water Works Association (AWWA) standards, the water meter shall be replaced and a testing fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for one inch or smaller water meters or seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for water meters greater than one inch shall be billed to the customer.

(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-2-2: - NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS: 
Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. 
A.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the superintendent of water and sewer may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections E. and F. 
B.  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the superintendent of water and sewer may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
C.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the superintendent of water and sewer shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
D.  A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section. 
1.  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of paragraph 2. of this section are met. 
2.  Criteria: 
a.  Either (i) the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or (ii) the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. 
b.  Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
c.  Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this section. 
d.  Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result. 
E.  When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the superintendent of water and sewer. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections E.1.a.-e. below. 
1.  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
a.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
b.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
c.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
d.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
e.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
2.  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
a.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
b.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
c.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the superintendent of water and sewer whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph F.1.c. of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the superintendent of water and sewer will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
d.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph E.1.a. of this section as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
3.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the superintendent of water and sewer: 
a.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
b.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
c.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 9-4-2-6. The industrial user must also be in compliance with section 9-4-13-3 regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
F.  The superintendent of water and sewer may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the superintendent of water and sewer. 
G.  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section 9-4-2-2 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
H.  Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be sued in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
I.  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the superintendent of water and sewer within two (2) business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the superintendent of water and sewer of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-2-3: - STATE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS: 
Users must comply with state of Illinois Environmental Protection Act Pretreatment Standards codified at 35 Ill. Administrative Code, Subtitle C, Chapter 1 Section 302. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-2-4: - LOCAL LIMITS: 
A.  The superintendent of water and sewer is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). 
B.  The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following daily maximum limit: 
0.5 mg/l arsenic 0.46 mg/l cadmium 2.00 mg/l chromium 0.80 mg/l copper 1.50 mg/l cyanide 100 mg/l FOG, nonpolar 400/600 mg/l FOG, polar 100 mg/l iron 0.20 mg/l lead 0.0005 mg/l mercury 1.65 mg/l nickel 0.25 mg/l phenol 2.13 mg/l total toxic organics 3.00 mg/l zinc  
The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The superintendent of water and sewer may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations above. 
C.  The superintendent of water and sewer may develop best management practices (BMPs), by chapter or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of section 9-4-2-1. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-2-5: - CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION: 
The city reserves the right to establish, by chapter or in individual wastewater discharge permits or in general permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-2-6: - DILUTION: 
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The superintendent of water and sewer may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-3: - PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER: 
9-4-3-1: - PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:

Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent of water and sewer for review, and shall be acceptable to the superintendent of water and sewer before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-3-2: - ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES: 
A.  Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent of water and sewer may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  The superintendent of water and sewer may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
C.  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent of water and sewer, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent of water and sewer, and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.

9-4-4-6: - WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING: GENERAL PERMITS: 
A.  At the discretion of the superintendent of water and wastewater, the superintendent may use general permits to control SIU discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met. All facilities to be covered by a general permit must: 
1.  Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; 
2.  Discharge the same types of wastes; 
3.  Require the same effluent limitations; 
4.  Require the same or similar monitoring; and 
5.  In the opinion of the superintendent of water and wastewater, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge permits. 
B.  To be covered by the general permit, the SIU must file a written request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all wastes covered by the general permit, any requests in accordance with subsection 9-4-6-4 B. for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, and any other information the POTW deems appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general permit until after the Superintendent has provided written notice to the SIU that such a waiver request has been granted in accordance with subsection 9-4-6-4 B. 
C.  The superintendent will retain a copy of the general permit, documentation to support the POTW's determination that a specific SIU meets the criteria in subsections 9-4-4-6 A.1. to 5. and applicable state regulations, and a copy of the user's written request for coverage for three (3) years after the expiration of the general permit. 
D.  The superintendent may not control an SIU through a general permit where the facility is subject to production-based categorical pretreatment standards or categorical pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or for IUs whose limits are based on the combined wastestream formula.

9-4-6-4: - PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS: 
A.  Except as specified in subsection C., all significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the superintendent of water and sewer submit no less than twice per year (June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the superintendent of water and sewer or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
B.  The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user (see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)). This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
1.  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
2.  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See subsection 9-4-4-5 A.8. 
3.  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
4.  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 9-4-1-4, and include the certification statement in subsection 9-4-6-14 A. (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)). 
5.  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
6.  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the superintendent of water and sewer must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the superintendent of water and sewer for three (3) years after expiration of the waiver. 
7.  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the superintendent of water and sewer, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in subsection 9-4-6-14 C. below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the industrial user. 
8.  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection 9-4-6-4 A., or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the superintendent of water and sewer, and notify the superintendent of water and sewer. 
9.  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
C.  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 9-4-6-14 A. of this chapter. 
D.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
E.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the superintendent of water and sewer, using the procedures prescribed in section 9-4-6-11 of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
F.  Users that send electronic (digital) documents to the city to satisfy the requirements of this section must submit same in a digital format acceptable to the city.

The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the superintendent of water and sewer within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Re-sampling by the industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-6-9: - NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE: 
A.  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 9-4-6-5 of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 9-4-6-1, 9-4-6-3, and 9-4-6-4 of this chapter. 
B.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph A. above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
C.  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent of water and sewer, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.

9-4-6-10: - ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS: 
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the superintendent of water and sewer or other parties approved by EPA. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-6-11: - SAMPLE COLLECTION: 
Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
A.  Except as indicated in subsections B. and C. below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the superintendent of water and sewer. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
B.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
C.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in sections 9-4-6-1 and 9-4-6-3 (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section 9-4-6-4 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
B.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph C. below, are met. 
C.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
1.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
2.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
3.  The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent of water and sewer within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
D.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
E.  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
F.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 2013-36, § 2, 10-21-2013) 
9-4-13-2: - PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS: 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 9-4-2-1 A. of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in subsections 9-4-2-1 B.3-18. of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
A.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
B.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

9-4-13-3: - BYPASS: 
A.  For the purposes of this section: 
1.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
2.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
B.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs C. and D. of this section. 
C.  Bypass Notifications: 
1.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
2.  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of water and sewer of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent of water and sewer may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
D.  Bypass: 
1.  Bypass is prohibited, and the superintendent of water and sewer may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph C. of this section. 
2.  The superintendent of water and sewer may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent of water and sewer determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph D.1. of this section.

10-6-4: - REVIEW STANDARDS FOR HISTORIC PROPERTIES: 
In making recommendations to the director of community development, the zoning board of appeals, the plan commission, the city council, or the owner of record of the subject property, the historic preservation commission shall be governed by the following review standards and design principles. 
A.  Standards for Review for Historic Landmarks and Historic District Properties. 
1.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a designated historic landmark or a property within a designated historic district in a manner that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, object, site, and/or its environment or to provide for the continued use of a property for its originally intended purpose. 
2.  The original distinguishing qualities or character of a building, structure, object, improvement, or site and its environment, including constructed landscape features such as fences, walls, arbors, and paving, shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be avoided when possible. 
3.  All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
4.  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, object, improvement, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
5.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
6.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material shall match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features shall be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
7.  The surface cleaning of character-defining elements, including building exteriors, shall be undertaken with the least destructive means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
8.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
9.  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment. 
10.  Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be undertaken and completed in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic building, structure, object, or site would be unimpaired. 
B.  Design Principles for Historic Landmarks and Historic District Properties: Any proposed work at a Historic Landmark or at a property within a designated historic district shall conform, subject to the restrictions of the City Zoning Ordinance, to the following general design principles: 
1.  Relationship of Building Mass and Space. The relationship between the open space between existing structures and adjoining structures shall be proportionate and compatible to the adjacent neighborhood; 
2.  Scale of Structure. The scale of any alterations, modifications, or additions, or of any new construction shall be compatible with the existing, surrounding structures; 
3.  Height. The height of any proposed alteration, addition, or new construction shall be compatible with the existing structure and with neighboring structures; 
4.  Directional Expression of Principal Façade. Any proposed alteration or new construction shall be compatible with the predominant horizontal or vertical expression of the historic structure and, for wholly new construction, the predominant horizontal or vertical expression along the street block; 
5.  Proportions of Street-facing Façades. The relationship between the width and height of any historic structure and any proposed modification, alteration, or addition at a street-facing façade shall be compatible with one (1) another and the relationship between the width and height of any proposed new structure shall be compatible with nearby structures; 
6.  Relationship of Windows and Doors. The relationship between and among doors and windows shall be compatible with and in proportion to each other and be compatible with the historic character of such elements; 
7.  Architectural Details. Architectural details and materials shall be incorporated, as necessary, to relate new construction with historic construction to preserve and enhance the inherent characteristics of the historic property and/or neighboring properties; and 
8.  Roof Shape. The design of any roof shall be compatible with the roof forms and materials of the historic roof of any existing improvement, building, structure, or object. 
    In addition to the foregoing, the historic preservation commission may apply review standards as further set forth in any policy, preservation plan, or design guideline adopted by the commission; the U. S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation; and/or the National Park Service's Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, each as amended from time-to-time. 
(Ord. No. 2016-01, § 2(Exh. B), 1-19-2016) 
10-6-5: - HISTORIC LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS: 
Historic landmarks and historic districts shall be established by ordinance of the city council in accordance with the procedures of the zoning ordinance of the city. Historic landmarks and historic districts shall be shown on the zoning map of the city and included as a part of the zoning regulations. 
    Before the designation of a historic landmark or the establishment of a historic district, the historic preservation commission and/or the preservation planner shall undertake sufficient documentation to justify or invalidate the historic significance of one (1) or more nominated improvements, properties, and/or sites. 
    The preservation planner shall provide analysis of any nomination for a historic landmark or historic district for review, comment, and action by the historic preservation commission. The analysis shall include the establishment of a period of significance as well as an evaluation of the historic significance of the exteriors of any building, structure, feature, site, objects; and the historic significance of the local context associated with the property or properties.

Within thirty (30) calendar days after such an appeal is made, the city council shall, by resolution, affirm or reverse the commission's determination according to the applicable standards set forth in this chapter. In accordance with said standards, the city council may also modify the commission's determination. A reversal or modification of the commission's determination shall be approved by a vote of not less than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the aldermen then holding office. 
10.  Final Inspection. The building official and/or building inspector(s), in consultation with the preservation planner, shall complete, prior to issuance of a final occupancy permit, an inspection of any work approved under a certificate of appropriateness to assure compliance with the approvals granted by the commission or on its behalf. 
11.  Suspension of Work. During the period beginning with the filing of an application for any construction work and ending with the final action of either the historic preservation commission or the city council, granting or denying said application, no exterior architectural feature of any building, structure, object, improvement, or site that is the subject of an application may undergo any alteration or construction, if such work would be subject to construction plan review and issuance of a building permit. Nothing in this subsection shall operate to bar ordinary repair and maintenance or any work that is necessary to prevent or correct an imminently dangerous or hazardous condition. 
12.  Lapse of a Certificate of Appropriateness. Any approval granted by the commission or city council for new construction, alteration, rehabilitation, renovation, or remodeling of any building, structure, object, improvement, or site shall be valid for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. Extensions of an approval may be granted-when approved work has proceeded in good faith-by the building commissioner, in consultation with the preservation planner, for six-month periods of time; however, extensions shall not exceed forty-eight (48) months beyond the original issuance date of a certificate of appropriateness. Failure to complete the approved work in a timely fashion will require the re-application for approval of any outstanding or proposed additional new construction, alteration, rehabilitation, renovation, or remodeling work.

(Ord. No. 2016-01, § 2(Exh. B), 1-19-2016) 
10-6-10: - DEMOLITION OF DESIGNATED PROPERTIES:

A.  Procedure for Historic Landmarks and Historic District Properties: Any application for a demolition permit for all or part of any historic landmark or at any property within a historic district shall be subject to the following review process. 
1.  Pre-application Meeting. Prior to submitting a demolition request, an applicant shall meet with the preservation planner, building official, city planner and/or director of community development to review the demolition proposal. At that time, the preservation planner shall identify, to the applicant, any known historic significance classification or documentation pertaining to the property. 
2.  Application. All applications for a demolition permit shall be submitted on forms provided by the preservation planner. No demolition permit application shall be accepted for processing unless it is complete and is accompanied by all applicable fees, deposits, bonds, and all items required by city ordinance. A complete demolition permit application shall contain the following:

j.  A comparison of the estimated rehabilitation cost of the property proposed for demolition with market values for comparable improvements, properties, or sites within the municipal boundaries; 
k.  A detailed cost estimate for the restoration of the site per city code in the event that no new construction activity commences following demolition; 
l.  A summary of potential sites, if any, to which the resource could be relocated within the historic district with an estimate of the cost of the move to each proposed location, if any, by a qualified building mover; 
m.  A proposed schedule for demolition activities; 
n.  A completed building permit application and a completed historic preservation review form; and 
o.  Other reasonable information required by city ordinance or that may be requested by city staff.

Concurrent with the filing, the applicant shall provide to the preservation planner a list, along with one (1) set of addressed envelopes with appropriate postage and return receipts (certified mail) affixed, of the owners of the subject properties and the owners of record of all properties situated within five hundred feet (500') from each boundary of the property proposed for demolition. Within ten (10) working days of the filing of an application, the preservation planner shall review the submitted application for demolition and inform the applicant, in writing, of any deficiencies which must be corrected and/or clarified prior to the scheduling of a public hearing. Failure of the applicant to provide amended information within thirty (30) working days of the notice of deficiencies will result in an automatic withdrawal of the application. 
5.  Notice. Upon receipt of a complete demolition application, the preservation planner shall schedule a public hearing for any historic landmark or property within a designated historic district, except for those properties designated as non-contributing due to a lack of architectural, historic, or structural significance or integrity, at the next, regularly-scheduled meeting of the commission that is possible in accordance with the stipulated public notice procedure. 
Demolition permit applications for non-contributing buildings with no architectural, historical, or structural significance or integrity shall be reviewed at a regular public meeting and shall not be subject to a public hearing or any stipulation related to noticing of a public hearing. 
Within five (5) working days of the filing of a demolition permit requiring a public hearing, the preservation planner shall notify, in writing by regular mail, the owners of record of all surrounding properties identified herein for notification. Notice of a public hearing shall be published on the City of Geneva webpage and in a newspaper of general circulation within the city not less than fifteen (15) calendar days nor more than thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the date of the hearing. The notice shall identify the applicant, property owners of record, legal description of the property where demolition work is proposed, and the common address of the property where demolition work is proposed. 
The preservation planner shall direct the erection of at least one (1) sign at the public right-of-way adjacent to the property that is the subject of the public hearing at least ten (10) calendar days in advance of the date of the public hearing.

Not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the public hearing, the preservation planner shall mail, using the envelopes provided by the applicant, a written notice to the owners of record of the property proposed for demolition and to the owners of record of all properties identified herein for notification. Written notice shall include the date, time, and location of the scheduled public hearing and information regarding access to a digital or written copy of the demolition application. 
The preservation planner shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the notice provisions set forth in this section. Failure to comply with any of the notice provisions, except for the publishing of the legal notice in the newspaper and the notice to the owners of the subject properties, shall not render any amendment invalid. 
6.  Commission Analysis. Prior to the public hearing, the preservation planner and the building official shall visit the site to familiarize themselves with the existing condition of the property proposed for demolition. The preservation planner and building official shall confer on their evaluation of the property. 
Prior to the public meeting for the purpose of reviewing a demolition application, the preservation planner, on behalf of the commission, shall conduct an analysis of the submitted documents and a written summary of the site visit as part of a written report containing preliminary findings on the historic, architectural, and aesthetic significance of the improvements. The analysis shall be provided to the commission, in writing, and made available to the public in advance of the public hearing. 
7.  Public Hearing. The public hearing for the purpose of reviewing a demolition application shall be conducted by the historic preservation commission and a record of such proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the commission shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time. 
The applicant bears the burden of proof that the failure to approve the proposed work would leave the subject property without an economically viable use, and that the sale, rental, or rehabilitation of the property is not possible, resulting in the property being incapable of earning any reasonable economic return. 
8.  Withdrawal by Applicant. An applicant may withdraw, in writing, a demolition application at any time preceding the scheduled public hearing. The applicant shall not be responsible for any fees incurred after the date of withdrawal. 
9.  Commission Action. The commission shall consider only the property, building, structure, architectural feature, or object proposed for demolition; the merit of any proposed replacement construction or improvement shall not be a standard of review for a demolition request. 
The commission may solicit expert testimony to evaluate information provided either as part of a demolition application or at the public hearing. 
A public hearing may be continued to a date certain in the event that the commission determines that additional information, unavailable at the public hearing, is warranted and necessary for the purpose of making a finding of fact. 
Additionally, the commission may continue a public hearing to the next regularly-scheduled meeting of the commission to provide time to fully evaluate new evidence presented at the public hearing. 
Furthermore, the commission may continue a public hearing regarding a request for demolition for a specified period of time, not-to-exceed one hundred twenty (120) calendar days, for the sole purpose of allowing the applicant and the commission to seek alternatives to demolition when the commission determines that all of the following conditions exist: 
a.  The property itself, or in relation to its environs, has significant historical, architectural, aesthetic or cultural value in its present condition; 
b.  Realistic alternatives for preservation for the property-including adaptive uses-are believed to be neither cost prohibitive nor beyond the limits of local market value; and 
c.  The property, in its existing condition, does not present a public health or safety hazard to individuals, neighboring properties or the greater community. 
When the commission postpones a recommendation regarding a demolition request, the commission shall retract said postponement when the commission determines that an applicant has: 
a.  Made a bona fide and reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort to locate a purchaser for the property who is willing to preserve, rehabilitate, or restore the improvement, property, or site; 
b.  Made a bona fide and reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort to locate a purchaser for the improvement who is willing and able to relocate the improvement to another property or site; 
c.  Made a bona fide and reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort to develop a cost effective program for the preservation of the improvement; and 
d.  Agreed to accept a demolition permit on specified conditions of the commission. 
When the commission considers a request for demolition, an applicant may be required, as a condition of demolition approval, to prepare and submit, prior to the commencement of demolition work, the following documentation of a building, structure, object, improvement, or site that is designated as a historic landmark or identified as a contributing or significant property within a designated historic district: 
a.  Site plan (scale not less than one (1) inch equals 20'-0"); 
b.  Floor plans of each level (scale not less than 1/8 " equals 1'-0"); 
c.  Elevations of each side of the property improvement (scale not less than 1/8 " equals 1'-0"); and 
d.  Photographs of each elevation and significant, interior or exterior architectural feature as determined by the commission (clear, black and white images). 
The commission shall make written findings of fact within forty-five (45) calendar days following the close of the public hearing. 
The commission may grant a demolition request for a historic landmark or a property within a historic district if, upon review of all testimony, the maintenance, use, and/or alteration of the property would cause immediate and substantial hardship for the owners of record because rehabilitation in a manner which preserves the architectural, historic, or structural integrity of the property either: 
a.  Is infeasible from a technical, mechanical, or structural perspective; or 
b.  Would leave the property with no reasonable economic value because it would require an unreasonable expenditure when accounting for such factors as current market value, permitted uses of the property, and/or the cost of compliance with local, state, and federal codes applicable to the property. 
The commission, by a simple majority vote, shall grant or deny the application for demolition. 
10.  Appeal of a Demolition Denial to City Council. If an application for any demolition work is not approved by the historic preservation commission, then the applicant may request, in writing, to the director of community development that an appeal of the commission's decision be made to the city council. 
Both the applicant and the commission have the right to be heard at the appeal proceedings. 
Upon consideration of the written record of the commission's decision and the applicant's appeal, the city council shall grant or deny the application for proposed demolition work. 
Within thirty (30) calendar days after such an appeal is made, the city council shall, by resolution, affirm, or reverse the commission's determination according to the applicable standards set forth in this chapter. In accordance with said standards, the city council may also modify the commission's determination. A reversal or modification of the commission's determination shall be approved by a vote of not less than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the aldermen then holding office. 
11.  Suspension of Work. During the period beginning with the filing of an application for demolition and ending with the final action of either the historic preservation commission or the city council, granting or denying said application, no exterior architectural feature of any building, structure, object, improvement, or site that is the subject of an application for demolition may undergo alteration, construction, demolition, or removal. Nothing in this subsection shall operate to bar ordinary repair and maintenance or any work that is necessary to prevent or correct an imminently dangerous or hazardous condition. 
12.  Site Restoration. Upon completion of any approved demolition, a site must be restored and maintained as required by City Code until such time that construction activity resumes at the property. 
13.  Lapse of Demolition Approval. Any approval granted by the commission or city council for the demolition, in whole or in part, of any building, structure, object, improvement, or site shall be valid for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the issuance of a demolition approval. Failure to complete the approved work in a timely fashion will require the re-application for approval of any outstanding demolition work. 
B.  Standards for Demolition Request Review: The historic preservation commission shall make findings related to a demolition request based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case and shall not approve a proposed demolition unless demolition action improves or corrects one (1) or more of the following conditions: 
1.  A building, structure, object, improvement, or site that constitutes a hazard to the safety and welfare of the general public or occupants of the improvement, property, or site as determined, in consultation with the preservation planner, by the City of Geneva Building Official, Code Enforcement Officer, Chief of Police, and Fire Chief; 
2.  A building, structure, object, improvement, or site that is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community for which the applicant has secured all necessary and required planning and zoning approvals, environmental clearances, and project financing; 
3.  The retention of a building, structure, object, improvement, or site that will cause undue economic hardship to the owner of record when a governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond the control of the applicant created the hardship and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship (which may include sale of the property at fair market value or relocation of the improvement to another site) have been attempted and exhausted by the applicant; or 
4.  The retention of a building, structure, object, improvement, or site is not in the best interest of the majority of the community. 
C.  Demolition by Neglect and Deferred Maintenance: Buildings, structures, and objects designated as a historic landmark or lying within the boundaries of a historic district shall be maintained and protected from demolition that results from neglect or undeterred deterioration of the exterior features or structural elements. 
1.  Duty to Maintain. Any building, structure, or object designated as a historic landmark or lying within the boundaries of a historic district shall be preserved against material deterioration of exterior features and structural elements by its owner of record. 
2.  Duty to Repair. The owner of record for any building, structure, or object designated as a historic landmark or lying within the boundaries of a historic district shall, upon written notice from the city code enforcement officer, or other representative on behalf of the city, repair any deficient element that is contributing to material deterioration, including, but not limited to, damage to or decay of: 
a.  Foundations, flooring, or floor supports that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling of all or part of the building, structure, or object; 
b.  Walls or other vertical supports that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling of all or part of the building, structure, or object; 
c.  Ceilings, roofs, and their support systems or other horizontal members, that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling of all or part of the building, structure, or object;

e.  Exterior finishes, including, but not limited to wood, brick, stone, stucco, mortar or other material; 
f.  Any design detail, significant feature, or structural element that results in any appreciable loss of architectural, historic, or structural integrity of the building, structure, or object; 
g.  Any window, window frame, door, or doorway that, individually or collectively, results in any appreciable loss of architectural, historic, or structural integrity of the building, structure, or object; 
h.  Any feature intended to provide a watertight condition that results in significant moisture infiltration into the building, structure, or object; or 
i.  Any feature or element that results in the creation of a fire hazard or other nuisance to the welfare of the general public. 
D.  Natural Destruction or Demolition: In the case of partial or complete destruction or demolition of a historic landmark or a building, structure, object, improvement, or site within a historic district as a result of an act of God or other natural disaster, the improvement may be completely demolished without commission review provided that the building official, fire department chief, and chief of police, in consultation with the preservation planner, jointly determine the improvement is structurally unsound and poses an immediate or imminent nuisance and/or hazard to the general health, safety, and welfare of the public.

A public hearing may be continued to a date certain in the event that the commission determines that additional information, unavailable at the public hearing, is warranted and necessary for the purpose of making a finding of fact. Furthermore, the commission may continue a public hearing to the next regularly-scheduled meeting of the commission to provide time to fully evaluate new evidence presented at the public hearing. 
Provided that the commission finds that the hardship was not created with the intent of circumventing this article, the commission, by a simple majority vote, shall grant relief from the rehabilitation standards due to economic hardship only if the commission finds that: 
1.  The subject property cannot be put to any reasonably beneficial use; 
2.  The owner of record or the applicant will suffer substantial economic loss if the application for proposed work that will yield a certificate of appropriateness is not approved; or 
3.  The retention of the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner of record or the applicant when a governmental action, an act of God, or other event beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the economic hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic district, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner of record and/or the applicant. 
The commission shall make written findings of fact within forty-five (45) calendar days following the close of the public hearing.

B.  Supplemental Regulations: The applicable supplemental regulations for the various parks and recreational uses, facilities and structures, as identified in the table in subsection A of this section, are set forth in this subsection (subsections B1 through B9 of this section): 
1.  Parking: 
a.  Number Of Parking Spaces Required: The number of required parking spaces shall be in accordance with section 11-11A-6 of this title. For Geneva park district facilities and uses only, the city may approve on street parking spaces in full or partial satisfaction of the parking requirement. However, for on street parking to be approved, the city may require the submittal of traffic and/or parking studies or other engineering plans or documentation demonstrating that such parking can be provided in a safe manner. The park district shall be responsible for all costs associated with the construction of on street parking spaces. 
b.  Special Parking Calculation: For the uses, facilities or structures listed as special uses and under which this supplemental regulation is applicable, the parking requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance shall be the minimum number of parking spaces required, but the final number of required parking spaces shall be as determined by the city council upon recommendation of the plan commission. For all permitted uses for which this supplemental regulation is applicable, the parking requirement set forth in the zoning ordinance shall represent the required number of spaces, provided that if the park district proposes a lesser number of parking spaces, the district may submit information which supports a reduction of required parking for review and final approval by the director of community development. 
2.  Principal Structures And Uses: The street, side and rear setbacks shall be as required within the zoning district in which the property is located, except where the side or rear lot line directly abuts a lot line of a lot zoned and used (or intended to be used) for residential purposes, in which case the required side and rear setbacks shall be not less than forty feet (40'). 
3.  Accessory Structures And Uses (Not Including Fences): Bleachers, portable toilets (permanent installations with visual screening), park benches, grills, refuse containers, and other similar accessory structures or hardscape elements shall be set back a minimum of twenty feet (20') from the lot line of a property zoned and used (or intended to be used) for residential purposes, except that walking, hiking or biking trails shall be set back a minimum of two feet (2') from the lot line of a property zoned and used (or intended to be used) for residential purposes, when not located within a right of way. 
4.  Parking Lots: The street setback for off street parking lots shall be not less than twenty feet (20'). The side and rear setbacks for off street parking lots shall be in accordance with the required side and rear setbacks for principal structures and uses of the zoning district in which the property is located, except where the side or rear lot line directly abuts a lot line of a lot zoned and used (or intended to be used) for residential purposes, in which case the required side and rear setback shall be not less than forty feet (40'). 
5.  Athletic Fields, Courts, Playgrounds And Other Active Use Areas: The street setback for any athletic field, court, playground or other "active use area", as defined herein, shall be in accordance with the required street setback for principal structures and uses of the zoning district in which the property is located. The edge of the field of play for athletic fields, courts, playgrounds and other active use areas shall be set back a minimum of forty feet (40') from the lot line of any abutting property zoned and used (or intended to be used) for residential purposes. 
For the purposes of this section, "active use area" shall be defined as that portion of a park site or recreational area that is designed to be regularly utilized by park users while engaged in the use of an amenity or equipment, including, but not limited to, playground equipment, sand play areas, garden areas, horseshoe pits, picnic areas (including grills and tables), and pavilions. Walking, hiking or biking trails shall not be considered an "active use area" for the purpose of this definition. 
6.  Fences: Fences for athletic facilities up to eight feet (8') in height may be located within a required street, side, or rear setback. Fences for baseball or softball backstops, tennis courts, or other athletic facilities may be a maximum of twenty feet (20') in height, however for all fences greater than eight feet (8') in height, the required setback shall be the required street, side and rear setbacks of the zoning district in which the property is located, except where the side or rear lot line directly abuts a lot line of a lot zoned and used (or intended to be used) for residential purposes, in which case the required side and rear setbacks shall be not less than forty feet (40'). Fences shall be constructed with the finished surface facing the neighboring property with support posts placed to the inside, except in such cases where the posts are an integral part of the fence design which enhances the aesthetic appearance of the fence. These requirements shall not apply to decorative fences (i.e., split rail) that are not primarily intended to enclose or contain an athletic playing field or court. 
7.  Other Agency Approval: Boardwalks, canoe portages, docks, fishing piers, natural open space, prairie restoration, wetlands and wildlife viewing areas are permitted; however, such uses, facilities and structures may be subject to separate review and approval from other regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the Illinois department of natural resources, the Illinois environmental protection agency, the United States army corps of engineers, the United States fish and wildlife service, county of Kane, etc. 
8.  Accessory Use Only: Concession stands, permanent portable toilet installations and restroom facility buildings are only a permitted accessory use to another listed use, facility or structure. Permanent portable toilet installations and restroom facility buildings are required to be screened with a combination of solid fencing and landscaping. 
9.  Water Park, Pool, Aquatic Center Or Spray Ground Expansion: An expansion that increases the permitted bather load by twenty five percent (25%) or more of an existing water park, pool, aquatic center or water spray ground shall require special use approval. 
C.  Landscaping: Landscape plans shall be designed in an effort to: 
1.  Demonstrate that reasonable efforts have been made to retain existing desirable plant species and healthy plant materials through the integration of those materials into the park site; 
2.  Contribute to the overall aesthetic appearance and environmental quality of the park site; 
3.  Provide for an arrangement of plant materials and related landscape features, utilizing plant species, plant sizes and plant quantities which effectively soften the impact, where appropriate, of building walls, utility equipment, loading/unloading docks, trash/recycling containers and accessory structures. Such landscape plan shall not interfere with the security of the park site, or create potential safety hazards or property surveillance difficulties. Also, all proposed landscape plantings shall have a reasonable chance of long term survivability based upon anticipated pedestrian activity patterns, vehicular traffic and other use characteristics of the site; 
4.  Provide for parkway trees at a ratio of one tree for each forty feet (40'), or fraction thereof, of street "frontage", as defined under the zoning ordinance. All parkway trees will be planted in accordance with the provisions of section 11-10-8 of this title, and will be maintained by the property owner for a two (2) year period of time from their initial installation. 
D.  Review Processes For Parks And Recreational Uses, Structures And Facilities: 
1.  Special Uses In Conformance With Supplemental Regulations: Applications for special uses shall be reviewed in accordance with the requirements set forth in section 11-14-4 of this title. 
2.  Permitted Uses Subject To Administrative Review In Conformance With Supplemental Regulations: Review and approval by the city's development staff is required for uses, facilities or structures listed as permitted uses subject to administrative review in conformance with supplemental regulations. The planning division shall determine the specific plans and information that is required to be submitted for the administrative review process based upon the use, facility or structure being proposed; however, typically, a site plan, landscape plan, building elevation plans, engineering plans, and in some cases, traffic and/or parking studies, are required. 
The city's development staff shall evaluate the proposed plans against all applicable regulations of this code. Where more restrictive than regulations found elsewhere in the zoning ordinance, the specific supplemental regulations for uses, facilities and structures contained herein shall apply. No plan commission or city council action is required in the review and approval of permitted uses subject to administrative review in conformance with supplemental regulations. Eighteen (18) folded sets of all required plans and information must be submitted. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of all required plans and information, the city shall review the plans and shall either issue a letter containing plan review comments, or a letter indicating approval of the plans, or approval with conditions. If modifications to the plans are necessary based upon the staff review comments, within twenty one (21) days of receipt of the revised plans, the city shall either indicate its approval of the revised plans, approval with conditions, or shall issue additional review comments. The twenty one (21) day review cycle shall apply to all subsequent reviews until such time as the city approves the plans or the petitioner withdraws the application. If the city fails to advise the park district, in writing, as to whether said plans and specifications comply with all applicable requirements within the time frames specified herein, the park district may proceed to construct the structure or facility. 
3.  Permitted Uses: The building commissioner shall determine whether a building permit is required for structures listed as permitted uses. (Ord. 2008-36, 8-4-2008)

If requested by the director of community development, the school district will retain a licensed engineer to perform a traffic impact study in accordance with good traffic engineering practices for the purpose of evaluating the impact of the proposed construction on traffic patterns in the area of the proposed construction project. In the event that the traffic impact study establishes the need for right of way improvements in the area of the proposed construction project, the city and the school district will meet and confer in an effort to determine an equitable sharing of responsibility therefor. 
I.  Review Procedures: Within thirty (30) days of receipt of plans and specifications or site plans from the school district, the city shall review said plans and specifications or site plans and advise the school district, in writing, as to whether said plans and specifications or site plans comply with the requirements of this article. If the city determines that the plans and specifications or site plans do not comply with the requirements of this article, the city will advise the school district as to the nature of the noncompliance. If the city fails to advise the school district, in writing, as to whether said plans and specifications or site plans comply with the requirements of this article, or the extent to which said plans and specifications or site plans are noncompliant, then the school district may proceed to construct the school building or addition to an existing school building, as the case may be; provided, however, that the school district's commencement of such construction shall constitute its representation that its plans and specifications or site plans comply with the requirements of this article. If the city notifies the school district that the plans submitted do not comply with the requirements of this article, the school district shall resubmit its plans in response to the city's review comments. The city shall review and provide written comments on the revised plans within twenty one (21) days of receipt. 
J.  Accessory Building/Structure Review: Prior to the construction of any new accessory building or structure or any addition to an existing accessory building or structure, other than the mere replacement of an existing accessory building or structure, the school district shall submit its most recent site plan and a sketch showing the location, dimensions, size and height of the proposed accessory building or structure to assure compliance with the provisions of this article. The city shall review said submitted plans and advise the school district within fifteen (15) days as to whether the proposed improvement complies with the requirements of this article. If the city notifies the school district that the submitted plans do not comply with the requirements, the school district shall resubmit its plans in response to the comments on noncompliance, whereupon the city shall review and provide written comments on the revised plans within seven (7) days of receipt. Should the city fail to provide written comment within the deadlines set forth in this subsection, the school district may proceed with the project as proposed. 
K.  Expenses: The city will not charge the school district for its review of the material submitted to the city under this section; however, in the event that the city incurs expense for outside consultants in the review of those materials submitted by the school district under this section, then the school district will reimburse the city for its actual costs incurred therefor.

2.  Standard: The existing street setbacks for all zoning lots in existence at the time of adoption of this title shall control for those lots and zoning lots in the B3 district fronting either side of the Third Street right of way between the south right of way line of Campbell Street to the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad.

[13] (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995) 
Footnotes: 
--- (13) --- 
See title 3, chapter 3 of this code. 

11-8B-2: - APPLICABILITY OF DISTRICT: 
Where property is mapped as H1, the provisions of section 11-14-8 of this title shall apply with regard to the commission on historic preservation's review and comment on zoning applications for map amendments, special use permits, site plans and variations. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995) 
CHAPTER 9 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 
SECTION: 

11-9-1: - AUTHORITY: 
The city council is hereby authorized to approve or disapprove planned unit developments, upon recommendation from the plan commission, in accordance with the provisions of this title. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995) 
11-9-2: - PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: 
A.  Planned unit developments are of such substantially different character from other special uses that specific and additional standards and exceptions are hereby established to govern the actions of the plan commission and city council. 
A planned unit development is a privilege to be earned and not a right which can be claimed simply upon complying with all the standards established in this section. The plan commission and City Council may require any reasonable conditions or design considerations which will promote proper development of benefit to the community. It is not intended that the City Council automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density increase in the case of each planned unit development. The commission shall recommend and City Council may grant only such increase or latitude which is consistent with the benefit accruing to the City as a result of the planned unit development. As a condition for approval, each planned unit development must be generally compatible with the character and objectives of the zoning districts within which it is located, and each planned unit development shall be consistent with the objectives of the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
B.  Specific purposes of the planned unit development procedure are: 
1.  Residential Planned Unit Development: To offer recreational opportunities close to home and to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by the conservation of streams and points of natural beauty. To add to the sense of spaciousness through the preservation of natural areas and open spaces, to counteract the effects of urban monotony and congestion in the streets and to encourage cooperative relationships between neighbors and participation by all age groups in the use and care of local open space tracts in new residential subdivisions. To promote appropriate architecture between adjacent dwellings or institutional buildings, and to encourage the placement of structures in proper relationship to the natural characteristics of the site, including cluster development, where appropriate. 
2.  Office Or Business Planned Unit Development: To promote the cooperative development of office or business centers each with adequate off-street parking, to control access points on thoroughfares and to separate pedestrian and automobile traffic. To aid in stabilizing property values and to develop centers of size and location compatible with the market potential, to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped transition areas and to encourage harmonious architecture between adjacent commercial structures and between dwellings and commercial structures. Business planned unit developments could include general or professional offices as well as retail and service uses. 
Several existing business locations within the City are potentially subject to redevelopment as a result of expressed public policy or general deterioration and obsolescence. These locations are proximate to the more historic business and retail areas of the community. Because of the unique character of these business areas, and the potential for incompatible development in the reuse or redevelopment, the B6 planned unit development district requires mandatory planned unit development approval to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of existing conditions and needs to provide for compatible development. 
3.  Office Research and Industrial Planned Unit Development: To promote the establishment of research and industrial parks, to permit groups of industrial buildings with integrated design and a coordinated physical plan, to encourage recreational facilities within industrial areas and to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped green spaces. To this extent office research and industrial planned unit developments will seek "campus like" settings for employment and manufacturing and uses which meet basic recreation and service needs. 
Because the City has planned for future employment areas proximate to residential areas, the City will carefully evaluate proposed recreational and open space systems and bicycle and pedestrian system connections within and areas surrounding the planned unit development to ensure system continuity. 
4.  Development Opportunity Sites and Redevelopment Opportunity Site Planned Unit Development: To promote the development or redevelopment of unused or underused sites where development should be encouraged. A range of different uses may be appropriate for these sites, as set forth in the City's Comprehensive Plan and Downtown/Station Area Master Plan. 
Because of the unique character of these sites, and the potential for incompatible development in the reuse or redevelopment, the B6 planned unit development district requires mandatory planned unit development approval to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of existing conditions and needs to provide for compatible development. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995; Ord. No. 2016-19, § 1, 5-16-2016)

1.  That the plan commission shall find such exception serves the purpose of promoting an integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such development as well as the neighboring property, than would be obtained under the bulk regulations of this title for buildings developed on separated zoning lots; 
2.  That in a residential planned unit development the maximum number of dwelling units permitted shall be determined by dividing the net development area by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the district or districts in which the area is located, and then increasing this number by twenty percent (20%). Net development area shall be determined by subtracting the areas set aside for nonresidential uses from the gross development area, and deducting from the remainder the area required for streets as set forth in the site plan. In no event shall the area for streets be computed at less than ten percent (10%) of the gross development area. The area of land set aside for common open space or recreational use may be included in determining the number of dwelling units permitted. 
B.  Residential Planned Unit Developments; Cluster Housing: Provided the overall number of dwelling units per acre (density) is not increased beyond the provisions of subsection A3 of this section, and provided that the permanent common open space is in accord with subsection C of this section, the planned unit development may include minimum lot areas, lot width and setback requirements to standards other than those normally required in the zoning district. 
In this case, dwelling unit arrangement would occur in cluster groups to maximize open space areas and reduce the demand for urban facilities and services. 
C.  Designation Of Permanent Common Open Space: For purposes of this section, "permanent common open space" shall be defined as parks, playgrounds, schools, landscaped green space, community centers or other similar areas in public ownership or areas covered by an open space easement. No plan for a planned unit development shall be approved, unless such plan provides for permanent open space equivalent to at least twenty percent (20%) of the total development area in residential planned unit developments.

For transition setbacks greater than twenty feet (20') in depth, two (2) shrubs or one (1) ornamental tree shall be provided for each five (5) medium to large shade trees required. 
b.  Berming: Transition setbacks may include earth berms. The placement of berms is encouraged to provide a change in orientation and undulation, and not necessarily be designed in a straight and linear pattern. Plantings placed on top of berms are restricted to species compatible with the terrain. 
c.  Screening: In a transition setback, berming, fencing and landscaping shall be used to provide a visual year round screen to a minimum height of six feet (6'). 
(1)  Exceptions In B2, B3 And GO Districts: In the B2, B3 and GO districts where a transition setback is required on a site proposed for adaptive reuse of an existing residential structure, or the construction of a new commercial structure, the plan commission may consider, and city council approve, alternative approaches to site screening and transition setback design which are deemed to be compatible with surrounding residential uses. In the GO district, this exception applies to land located within Area 1 only. For reuse of residential structures where no changes to the exterior of the dwelling and property are proposed for the rear yard, nor any extension of use or outdoor activity proposed, the plan commission and city council, subject to reasonable conditions, may waive the transition setback requirement. Such waiver and any conditions shall be stipulated as part of plan approval. 
d.  Ground Cover: All transition setbacks, except where occupied by other landscape material shall be seeded or sodded. 
H.  Landscaped Corridors:

e.  Shrubs: Twenty four inches (24"). 
f.  Ground Cover Plants: Whether in the form of crowns, plugs or containers, shall be planted in numbers appropriate by species to provide fifty percent (50%) surface coverage after one (1) growing season. 
2.  Methods of determining planting sizes shall be as follows. This section outlines acceptable specifications for shade trees and flowering trees: 
a.  Shade And Flowering Trees: In size grading balled and burlapped trees, caliper size shall take precedence over tree height. For purposes of simplicity, only one (1) size per "grade" will be listed. That size will be the minimum size allowable for that grade and shall include plants from that size up to but not including the next larger grade size. (Example: Acer rubrum, two inch (2") caliper. This could include Acer rubrum calipering two inches (2") up to but not including 21/2 inches in caliper, measured six inches (6") above the ground line.) 
The caliper of the trunk shall be taken six inches (6") above the ground up to and including four inch (4") caliper size, and twelve inches (12") above the ground for larger sizes. Seldom are tree trunks perfectly round. Therefore, caliper measurement may be taken with "slot" type caliper, "pincer" type caliper, or diameter tape. 
b.  Conifers And Evergreens: This subsection outlines acceptable specifications for conifers and evergreens. 
For purposes of simplicity, only one (1) size per "grade" will be used. That size will be the minimum size allowable for the grade, and the grade shall include plants from that size up to but not including the next larger grade size. (Example: Taxus media "Brownii", fifteen inches (15"). This could include Taxus media "Brownii" fifteen inches (15") in height up to, but not including, eighteen inches (18") and having a minimum spread of twelve inches (12"). 
The following height measurement units shall apply: 
3 inch intervals up to eighteen inches (18")in height 
6 inch intervals from eighteen inches (18") to four feet (4') 
1 foot intervals greater than four feet (4') 
c.  Deciduous Shrubs: This subsection outlines acceptable specifications for deciduous shrubs, dwarf and semi-dwarf shrubs and strong growing shrubs. 
For purposes of simplicity, only one (1) size per "grade" will be used. That size will be the minimum size allowable for that grade, and the grade shall include plants from that size up to but not including the next larger grade size. (Example: Forsythia, two feet (2'). This could include Forsythia plants with not less than three (3), two-foot (2') canes up to but not including four (4), three-foot (3') canes.) 
(1)  Dwarf And Semi-Dwarf Shrubs: Determine height in inches up to twenty four inches (24"); above twenty four inches (24") determine height in feet. Grade in three inch (3") series to eighteen inches (18"), six inch (6") series, eighteen inches (18") to twenty four inches (24"). (Example 12 inch; 15 inch; 18 inch; 2 feet; 21/2 feet.) 
(2)  Strong Growing Shrubs: Determine height in six inch (6") series up to twenty four inches (24") tall (example: 12 inches; 18 inches); over twenty four inches (24"), measure in single feet up to six feet (6') tall; over six feet (6'), measure in two foot (2') increments. (Example: five feet (5'), six feet (6'), eight feet (8'), ten feet (10'). 
3.  Ground Cover Specifications: 
a.  Areas To Be Graded And Sodded: Areas to be sodded shall be graded smooth and topped with at least four inches (4") of black dirt after compacting and removal of stumps, trees that cannot be saved, boulders and other debris. Swales, which require sodding, shall have a minimum sodding width of ten feet (10'). 
b.  Areas To Be Graded And Seeded: All open areas of the development which are not paved, sodded or otherwise landscaped shall have a new lawn established through seeding. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995; Ord. 2017-19, § 3, 7-17-2017) 
11-10-7: - PLANT MATERIALS:

B.  Planting Methods: This subsection outlines guidelines for the installation of all landscape material. 
1.  Most small, deciduous trees may be moved bare rooted unless otherwise indicated. Roots of bare rooted trees must be protected against drying out. 
2.  All coniferous trees shall be moved balled and burlapped. Balled roots should be prevented from drying out at the surface of their ball, and they should be protected from freezing. 
3.  Pits for the planting of bare root plans shall be least twelve inches (12") larger in diameter than the diameter of the root system in order to accommodate the roots without crowding. For balled trees, the pits should be a minimum of twelve inches (12") larger than the diameter of the ball of soil to allow proper backfill. 
4.  Plants shall be planted no deeper than previously grown with due allowance for settling. 
5.  In planting containers, artificial drainage shall be provided for the root system of any species intolerant of wet sites, or a species tolerant to wet sites shall be used. 
6.  Top soil, compost, peat moss or an acceptable soil mixture may be placed about the roots of bare root stock or in the backfill around balled stock. When the planting is completed, the entire root system shall be thoroughly saturated with water and cord and burlap wrapping shall be cut and/or removed. 
7.  Although pruning should be done to develop a balance with the root system, excessive pruning at the time of transplanting should be avoided. 
8.  Tree trunks shall be suitably wrapped and guyed, or supported in an upright position, according to accepted arboricultural practices. The guys or supports shall be installed so that they will neither girdle nor cause serious injury to the tree nor endanger public safety. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995; Ord. 2017-19, § 3, 7-17-2017) 
11-10-8: - PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE AND MAINTENANCE: 
A.  Performance Guarantee: All required landscaping materials, both living and nonliving, shall be in place prior to the time of issuance of a final certificate of occupancy, weather permitting. In periods of adverse weather conditions, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued, subject to the posting a performance guarantee in the form of a cash escrow, letter of credit, surety bond, or letter of commitment, issued by a bank, savings and loan association, surety, or insurance company, in favor of the city, which guaranty is deemed good and sufficient by the city, in an amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) the estimated cost of the landscaping. The estimated cost shall be certified by a landscape contractor. The performance guaranty may be forfeited if the landscaping is not completed within one (1) year after the issuance of the temporary certificate of occupancy. Forfeiture of any performance guarantee shall not relieve the owner of the responsibility to complete the required landscaping. The performance guarantee shall also be accompanied by a statement of the owner giving the city the right to enter upon the property to complete landscaping in the case of forfeiture. 
B.  Maintenance Of Landscaping And Maintenance Bond: 
1.  Trees, shrubs, and other landscaping materials depicted on landscaping plans approved by the city shall be considered to be elements of the project in the same manner as parking, building materials and other details. The developer, its successor and/or subsequent owners and their agents shall be responsible for maintenance of landscaping on the property on a continuing basis for the life of the development. Plant materials which exhibit evidence of insect pests, disease and/or damage shall be appropriately treated, and dead plants promptly removed and replaced within the next planting season after installation. All landscaping will be subject to periodic inspection by the zoning administrator, or his designee. Should landscaping not be installed, maintained and replaced as needed to comply with the approved plan, the owner and its agent or agents shall be considered in violation of the terms of the certificate of occupancy. The director of community development is empowered to enforce the terms of this chapter. 
2.  As a condition to issuance of a final certificate of occupancy, a cash escrow, irrevocable letter of credit, surety bond, or letter of commitment, issued by a bank, savings and loan association, surety, or insurance company in favor of the city in the amount of twenty-five percent (25%) of the initial landscaping costs shall be posted to ensure the needed replacement of materials and the continued maintenance of the same for a period of two (2) years after initial installation. Surety may be forfeited if the necessary maintenance and replacement has not been performed in a satisfactory manner within the two-year period. Further, should it be determined that the landscaping as approved on the landscaping plan is not being maintained as specified beyond the initial two-year maintenance period, resubmission of the approved plan and the posting of an additional maintenance surety may be required by the city. 
(Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995; Ord. No. 2011-04, §§ 3, 4, 1-18-2011; Ord. 2017-19, § 3, 7-17-2017) 
11-10-9: - ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF AND PLAN REVISIONS: 
A.  Administrative Relief: Application for administrative relief of the requirements in this chapter may be filed with the director of community development. Ten (10) copies of the application and all supporting documentation shall be submitted. Such application shall be submitted with the landscape plan and demonstrate the following: 
1.  The strict application of the regulation in question is unreasonable given the development proposal or the measures proposed by the applicant, or, that the property has extraordinary or exceptional physical conditions that do not generally exist in nearby properties in the same zoning district and such conditions will not allow a reasonable use of the property in absence of relief. 
2.  Dependent upon the approval process under which the application for relief is sought, the approving authority shall make the final decision upon whether any relief from these requirements may be approved. 
B.  Effect Of Approval; Plan Revisions: An application may be made following the initial submission of a landscape plan to propose alternatives or changes to the approved plan or any plans pending approval, or as may be requested by the city. Any alterations or changes to a plan document upon resubmission to the director of community development shall include plan copies required under section 11-10-5 of this chapter, above together with a written statement indicating all changes made and a revision block on the face of the plans indicating each date of revision. 
All plan changes shall be represented on the face of the plans 1) by notation encompassing the area of change and with reference to the written statement of changes. Except where changes are noted, the content of the plan is presumed to be that of the last plan accepted by the director of community development. The director of community development may reject any plan changes where insufficient documentation of the location and nature of the changes 2) lends the proposed revisions uninterpretable. 
Any proposed changes to a landscape plan following final action on the plan shall constitute a new application subject to the procedures and requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995; Ord. 2002-53, 9-3-2002; Ord. 2017-19, § 3, 7-17-2017) 
CHAPTER 10A - TREE PRESERVATION[15] 
SECTION: 

Footnotes: 
--- (15) --- 
See also title 8, chapter 5, article C of this code. 

11-10A-1: - PURPOSE: 
The tree conservation requirements specified herein are intended to foster responsible development and to prevent the unnecessary clearing and disturbing of land. The intent of this chapter is to encourage the preservation of existing trees by establishing regulations regarding the removal of large, healthy, highly rated trees, as defined herein, and ensuring the replacement of such trees within the city so as to safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment of the community. 
The city council finds that trees are unique and intrinsic assets. Due to their size, species, historic association and ecology, they contribute significantly to the health and general welfare of the citizens of a community. It is the policy of the city council of the city of Geneva to preserve, protect and maintain, to the greatest extent possible, existing trees within the city. The roles of trees are to: 
A.  Enhance the unique physical, historical and aesthetic character of Geneva, and are part of its identity as signified by the oak tree on the city emblem. 
B.  Aid in controlling stormwater runoff, stabilizing soil by preventing erosion and sedimentation, and replenishing ground water supplies. 
C.  Enhance air quality by removing carbon dioxide, generating oxygen and filtering air pollutants. 
D.  Reduce noise through buffering and screening. 
E.  Reduce energy consumption by providing shade and a windbreak effect. 
F.  Enhance the habitat and food source for birds and other wildlife, which in turn control insect populations and maintain the balance of natural ecosystems. 
G.  Enhance property values and create a desirable commercial environment.

B.  Tree Removal Permit Application: An application for a tree removal permit shall be made to the community development department. The application shall include a written statement indicating the reasons for the removal of the tree(s), a map of the parcel of land indicating the location of the tree(s) to be removed; and a tree preservation plan if the provisions set forth in section 11-10A-4 of this chapter pertaining to formal site plan review, preliminary planned unit development plan review and preliminary subdivision plat review are applicable to the site. 
C.  Basis For Tree Removal Permit Approval: The community development department may approve an application for a tree removal permit under one (1) or more of the following circumstances: 
1.  Safety Hazard: The tree poses a safety hazard to persons, property or the community, which cannot be remedied by proper tree pruning techniques alone. 
2.  Diseased Or Weakened Trees: The tree is substantially diseased or weakened by age, storm, fire or other injury. 
3.  Observation Of Good Forestry Practice: Removal of one (1) or more specified trees is in accordance with good forestry practice, such as when the parcel of land will only support a certain number of healthy, preservable trees that is less than the number of existing preservable trees on the parcel. 
4.  All Reasonable Efforts Undertaken: All reasonable efforts have been undertaken in the land planning, architectural and engineering design of the proposed building(s), development or site improvements to minimize tree damage and/or removal, and the tree or trees must be removed to provide adequate space for the permitted construction. 
5.  Approved Tree Preservation Plan: Formal approval of a site plan (see chapter 14, article A of this title), preliminary planned unit development plan approval (see chapter 9 of this title), or preliminary subdivision plat approval (see title 12 of this code).

11-10A-6: - TREE SURVEY: 
The tree survey shall contain the following information: 
A.  A tree survey showing the location, condition rating, species (both scientific and common names) and trunk diameter of all trees located on the parcel, municipal trees and border trees with a trunk size of four inches (4") or greater. Trees shall be measured in accordance with the American Association of Nurserymen's Industry Standard (AANIS 260.1). The caliper of the trunk shall be taken at 4.5 feet for all sizes. 
B.  The condition rating of the trees shown on the tree survey shall be determined using the following rating criteria: [16] 
Rating Description General Criteria 1 Excellent The tree is typical of the species, has less than 10 percent deadwood in the crown that is attributable to normal causes, has no other observed problems, and requires no remedial action. 2 Good to fair The tree is typical of the species and/or has less than 20 percent deadwood in the crown, only 1 or 2 minor problems that are easily corrected with normal care. 3 Fair The tree is typical of the species and/or has less than 30 percent deadwood in the crown, 1 or 2 minor problems that are not eminently lethal to the tree, and no significant decay or structural problems, but the tree must have remedial care above normal care in order to ensure continued health. 4 Fair to poor The tree is not typical of the species and/or has significant problems such as 30-50 percent deadwood in the crown, serious decay or structural defect, insects, disease, or other problems that can be eminently lethal to the tree or create a hazardous tree if not corrected in a short period of time or if the tree is subjected to additional stress. 5 Poor The tree is not typical of the species and/or has over 50 percent deadwood in the crown, major decay or structural problems, is hazardous or is severely involved with insects, disease, or other problems that even if aggressively corrected, would not result in the long term survival of the tree. 6 Dead Less than 10 percent of the tree shows signs of life.  
C.  The community development department staff or the city's professional forester may waive the tree survey requirement on those portions of the site that are determined unaffected by the proposed development activity. (Ord. 2004-11, 2-17-2004, eff. 5-3-2004; Ord. 2017-19, § 4, 7-17-2017)

11-10A-8: - PRESERVATION OF EXISTING TREES AND INTEGRATION INTO THE LANDSCAPE PLAN: 
It is the intent of this chapter to encourage each applicant to retain healthy and desirable tree species in the development of a site plan and landscape/land management plan for the proposed development. Class A (key specimen trees), Class B (significant trees), municipal trees and border trees shall be preserved, or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The applicant shall consult with the community development department staff or the city's professional forester during the early stages of site planning to accomplish the preservation or replacement of trees at the site and prior to the preparation of any development plans. (Ord. 2004-11, 2-17-2004, eff. 5-3-2004; Ord. 2017-19, § 4, 7-17-2017) 
11-10A-9: - SPECIAL RELIEF FROM TREE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS THROUGH TREE PLACEMENT: 
A.  In the event, after consultation with the community development staff and the city's professional forester, it is determined that there is no viable and practical alternative except to remove one (1) or more Class A, Class B or municipal trees, the city council may grant relief from the tree preservation requirements by approving the planting of replacement trees. In such cases, removed trees shall be replaced with replacement trees at the following ratios: 
Class A trees shall be replaced on a two (2) times the diameter inch basis (Example: A twenty-four inch (24") tree should be replaced with new trees totaling forty-eighty inches (48") in caliper). 
Class B trees shall be replaced on a caliper inch per diameter inch basis (Example: A twenty-four inch (24") tree should be replaced with new trees totaling twenty-four inches (24") in caliper). 
Municipal trees that qualify as Class A or Class B shall be replaced as such. Municipal trees that do not qualify in Class A or B shall be replaced on a two (2) trees per one (1) tree removed basis. 
B.  Replacement trees shall be selected from the city's recommended tree list or as may be approved by the community development department staff or the city's professional forester. 
C.  In the event the community development department staff, the city's professional forester or plan commission determine that a particular site is insufficient in size to plant additional trees (replacement trees), the city council may approve monetary contributions by the applicant to the city tree bank fund for replacement trees. Replacement tree costs for the purposes of this subsection shall be based on a three (3) year average of the retail cost for the least expensive tree on the city's recommended tree list, at a 2.5 inch caliper. The City will provide a current replacement tree cost to the applicant. Replacement trees shall be a minimum of 2.5 inches in caliper and be guaranteed for a period of one (1) year. Smaller sizes may be planted if in the opinion of the city's professional forester the smaller caliper tree is the standard horticultural recommendation for the particular species or location.

A.  No construction activity, movement, and/or placement of equipment or material or spoils storage shall be permitted within the critical root zone of Class A, Class B or municipal tree. No excess soil, additional fill, liquids or construction debris shall be placed within the critical root zone of a protected tree. 
B.  Appropriate protective tree fencing shall be installed for protection of trees. 
C.  No attachments, fences, or wires, other than those approved for bracing, guying or wrapping, shall be attached to trees during the construction period. 
D.  Other root zone protection measures such as mulching, construction pruning, root pruning, crown pruning, trunk wrapping, directional boring, root zone bridges and fertilization of trees directly affected by construction must be approved by the community development department and shall be completed in accordance with the "Arboricultural Specifications Manual". 
E.  Unless otherwise shown on the approved tree preservation plan, no soil is to be added to or removed from the critical root zone of any protected tree. Trees on an adjacent lot within fifteen feet (15') of the construction activity area shall be protected, as specified in the tree preservation plan. 
If, in the opinion of the director of community development department and/or the city's professional forester, the necessary protection measures, as specified in the tree preservation plan for the development were not implemented before commencement of, or during any construction activity on the development site, the resolution approving site plan or the ordinance granting the special use planned unit development or the resolution authorizing approval of the subdivision plat for the subject development may be revoked by the city council, or a stop work order may be issued by the community development department until such time as the approved protection measures have been implemented and any required mitigation has been completed.

ARTICLE C. - TRAFFIC AND ACCESS REGULATIONS 
SECTION: 

11-11C-1: - PURPOSE: 
This article is intended to establish specific criteria and standards for traffic and access applicable to almost all types of development within the city. These provisions are intended to provide a uniform set of standards upon which all development proposals may be reviewed. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995) 
11-11C-2: - TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS: 
A.  When Required: A traffic impact analysis may be required under situations as described as follows: 
1.  An application for development approval for: 
Low density residential developments fifteen (15) acres in size or greater; 
Multiple family developments (including two- and three-family) ten (10) acres in size or greater; 
Nonresidential developments five (5) acres in size or greater. 
2.  Where the city engineer or the director of community development deems that the proposed development will have significant traffic impact to safe and efficient movement, and to the general public welfare. 
B.  Content Of Traffic Impact Analysis: 
1.  Each traffic impact analysis shall provide, at a minimum, the following information: 
a.  Identify the site vicinity with respect to the surrounding thoroughfare street system and adjacent land use; and 
b.  Identify the locations of all intersections and/or private access opposite the site and nearest to the site on any public streets bordering the site. Distances to the nearest intersections and/or private access from the site boundaries along the bordering public streets shall be reported. 
2.  The city engineer may request additional information to be provided in the traffic impact analysis as follows: 
a.  An assessment of level of service for future year projected conditions. Along with this requirement, the city engineer shall supply the applicant with any existing published data on future year traffic; 
b.  Additional intersections where level of service computations are to be performed. Additional intersections so identified shall not be greater than one mile from the site boundary; 
c.  Other issues as identified by the city engineer including, but not limited to, access location, traffic circulation, parking and median break impacts. When such additional information is requested, the city engineer may upon request by the applicant, provide reasons for such additional requirements; 
d.  Boundaries along the bordering public streets shall be reported. Identify existing traffic volumes on any ordering public streets and on any public street passing through the site; 
e.  Provide an estimate for distribution of site generated trips onto the street system surrounding the site. The basis for the estimated trip distribution should be clearly identified; and 
f.  Compute the level of service for each access to an intersection with the arterial and collector street system from the site. Compute the level of service for the arterial and collector street system intersections nearest to each site access to the arterial and collector street systems. Level of service computations should be performed for existing conditions, if applicable, for development in accordance with the existing zoning and comprehensive plan land use intensities and for the proposed site development. Level of service computations should be performed for the morning and evening commuter peak hour, unless otherwise permitted or directed by the city engineer. 
g.  A ten (10) year traffic projection on select roadways, as determined by the city engineer, which include the impact of known planned developments within one thousand three hundred twenty feet (1,320') of the site.

1.  The applicant shall complete and submit a permit application, as set forth in subsection B. of this section, and an application for historic preservation commission review. 
2.  The building commissioner shall review the permit application for compliance with the sign regulations set forth in this chapter and forward the application to the historic preservation commission for its review and action. 
3.  The historic preservation commission shall review the application for compliance with (1) the sign regulations, (2) the commission's adopted design guidelines, and (3) the following standards established by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior: 
a.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
d.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.

4.  In conducting its review, the commission shall also consider the following criteria: 
a.  Design: The material, size, color, scale and design of signs and awnings should be compatible with the architecture of the building. Signs should be subordinate and sympathetic to the overall design of the building(s) on the property. 
b.  Multiple-Tenant/User Buildings: Where buildings have multiple storefronts and multiple tenants, signs and awnings should be coordinated with one another in terms of size, placement, lettering, color and design. 
c.  Mounting: Mounting of signs and awnings should occur without damaging building materials or obscuring architectural features. 
d.  Historic Signs: Existing historic signs that contribute to the overall character of the building or district should be preserved. 
e.  Lighting: Signs and awnings may be illuminated from external lighting sources, such as gooseneck lighting for wall signs or spot lighting for freestanding signs. 
5.  The commission shall make a finding of fact and take action on the application (approval, approval with conditions, or denial), and shall forward its findings and action to the building commissioner. 
6.  If the application is in full compliance with the regulations set forth in this chapter, and all other applicable codes, and the historic preservation commission has approved the application, the building commissioner shall issue a permit. 
7.  If the historic preservation commission has denied the application, the building commissioner shall not issue a permit. The applicant may revise the permit application and resubmit for further review or appeal the decision to the city council, as set forth in section 10-6-6 of the City Code.

F.  Issuance Of Permit: A permit for any sign subject to the review of the plan commission, historic preservation commission, or city council shall not be issued until approval from the reviewing body is forwarded to the building commissioner. A permit shall be issued by the building commissioner if the proposed sign conforms to the provisions of this chapter and the required permit fee has been paid. 
G.  Permit Expiration: If the work authorized under a permit has not been completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void. 
H.  Failure To Secure A Permit: Any sign erected, repaired, altered, or relocated without having first been issued a permit shall be subject to the penalty provisions set forth in section 11-12-13 of this chapter and will be required to complete a permit application as set forth in this section. The permit fee shall be doubled for a sign that is installed without a permit. The permit application shall be reviewed by the building commissioner, plan commission, historic preservation commission, and/or the city council, as required by the City Code.

A MSP shall include information on the number, styles, sizes, colors, locations, and materials used for existing business identification signs, and future signs installed on the building. Signs shown on a MSP should complement the architecture of the building, and demonstrate the use of common sign design elements and themes among the multiple signs shown on the plan. 
A.  Initiation: The owner of a building or development containing multiple business entities (tenants/users) may elect to establish a MSP. Once established, each sign for the building/development shall conform to the approved MSP. Applications for approval of a MSP may be submitted for review and approval concurrently with the submittal of permit applications for proposed individual business identification signs. 
B.  Application: The owner(s) of the property for which the MSP approval is sought shall file an application on forms provided by the building commissioner and shall contain or have attached thereto the following information: 
1.  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant.

For properties located in a historic district, the building commissioner shall not approve a MSP unless the plan has been reviewed and approved by the historic preservation commission. A MSP shall meet the following objectives: 
1.  Conforms to the requirements set forth in this chapter, unless otherwise granted relief as set forth in section 11-14-5A of this title. 
2.  Implements the purpose and intent of this chapter.

1.  The property owner shall provide a copy of the approved MSP to all current business entities within the building or development, as well as to any future business entities prior to any closing on the sale of the property, or execution of a lease. 
2.  An approved MSP does not negate the need for a sign permit for the installation of signs. All signs are required to obtain a permit as set forth in section 11-12-2 of this chapter. However, permit applications for individual signs within a historic district which conform to an approved MSP shall not require further review or approval by the historic preservation commission. 
3.  The city shall review all sign permit applications for compliance with the approved MSP prior to the issuance of a permit. 
F.  Expiration: Upon approval of a MSP, all sign permits issued thereafter shall conform to the plan. Once the MSP is approved, the approval shall run with the land and shall not change or dissolve with a change in ownership of the building/development. 
G.  Changes: The owner(s) of a property may request an amendment to an approved MSP following the same application requirements and review procedures set forth in subsections 11-12-14 A. through 11-12-14 D. above. Any requested amendment to an approved MSP, including modification or termination of the plan, shall require the written consent of all property owners/tenants of each building involved. 
H.  Existing Signs On Multi-Tenant/Owner Buildings: Signs, including legal nonconforming signs, located on a multi-tenant/owner building that were installed prior to the approval of a MSP for the building or development in which the building is located, may remain and be maintained by ordinary repairs but shall not be altered, enlarged, replaced, relocated or reconstructed unless such change conforms to the approved MSP for the building or development.

Expansion Of Use In A Nonconforming Building Or Structure: A conforming use in a nonconforming building or structure, may be expanded within the building or structure in which said use is presently located. However, no changes or structural alterations shall be made unless such changes or structural alterations and the use thereof conform to all the regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located. 
6.  Nonconforming Fences And Walls: Fences and walls constructed prior to October 3, 1994, which do not conform to the provisions of this section, except for plant material, shall be considered legal nonconforming structures. However, any replacement of a nonconforming fence or wall, either by sections or of the whole, on a zoning lot in excess of fifty percent (50%) of its total area shall conform to the provisions of this section. 
Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be made, provided such repairs and maintenance do not increase the height, or cause any other structural change, or the relocation of the fence. 
C.  Nonconforming Use Of Buildings Or Structures: 
1.  Change Of Use In Nonconforming Building Or Structure: The use of a nonconforming building or structure may be changed to another use permitted in the district in which the building or structure is located. However, no change shall extend or otherwise violate any provision made in this title for elimination of such nonconforming building or structure and the use thereof.

3.  Change Of Use: A nonconforming use of land shall not be changed to any other use except to a use permitted in the district in which the land is located. 
E.  Nonconforming Landscaping: 
1.  Landscaping is important in improving the overall appearance of the city and increasing the compatibility of different land uses. It is recognized that landscaping is difficult to install in conjunction with relatively small increments of change in a development project (such as relatively small building additions or changes of use) for the following reasons: a) the landscaping elements of a development project should be planned in a comprehensive and coordinated manner which is not feasible to implement with relatively small increments of change; b) nonconformities related to landscaping are difficult to resolve where the existing improvements limit the potential for a comprehensive landscaping plan to be implemented; and c) fragmented ownership in a development project can further reduce the potential for a comprehensive landscaping plan to be implemented with relatively small increments of change. Any development not complying with the requirements of this title as of the effective date hereof is considered legally nonconforming. 
2.  Existing legally nonconforming landscaping is permitted to continue until one of the following changes occurs: 
a.  Any new construction or addition of building floor area consisting of twenty five percent (25%) or more of the existing gross building floor area of the development project on the subject lot; or 
b.  Any change from a residential use to a nonresidential use (or vice versa) consisting of twenty five percent (25%) or more of the existing gross building floor area of the development project on the subject lot. 
3.  All required landscaping in accordance with chapter 10 of this title shall be provided in conjunction with either of the two (2) changes described above. 
4.  All required landscaping shall be provided in conjunction with any new development of a vacant lot or with the total redevelopment (demolition and new construction) on a lot or zoning lot.

CHAPTER 14 
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 
ARTICLE A. - SITE PLAN REVIEW 
SECTION: 

11-14A-1: - AUTHORITY: 
The city council has the authority, upon recommendation of the plan commission, to approve or disapprove site plans required to be submitted for approval under this article. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995) 
11-14A-2: - PURPOSE: 
Plan review and approval is required to ensure that the use and development of land as authorized under this title is undertaken in an orderly and proper manner that furthers the public health, safety and welfare and makes adequate provision for assuring the availability of appropriate public and private services and amenities and for minimizing the adverse effects of such development. 
The design, orientation and location of open spaces, buildings, structures and signs visible from public streets, places and ways has a material and substantial relationship to property values and the taxable values of property in the city and the cost of the municipal services provided thereto. Further, many neighborhoods in other urban and suburban communities have deteriorated in the past by reason of the lack of planning, neglect of proper maintenance standards and the erection of buildings and structures unsuitable to and incompatible with the character of the neighborhood or area, resulting in a reduction in property values. 
Therefore, it is the policy of the city that these regulations be adopted to avoid and prevent deterioration of the function, character and appearance of the city and provide a favorable environment for residents and businesses, and to preserve and enhance the property values and the general public welfare. (Ord. 95-28, 5-1-1995)

B.  Where an existing principal structure erected prior to the date of adoption of this title is proposed to be expanded, for which the sum total of gross floor area expansion(s) since the date of this title are equal to or greater than twenty five percent (25%) of the total gross floor area of said structure. 
C.  Any new or modified building and/or site improvements for a zoning lot which has previously received site plan approval under this title, reapproval of the plan is required for components of the plan which depart from the approved site plan. The extent of changes to be incorporated in the submittal for reapproval shall be determined by the director of community development. 
D.  A site plan shall not be required exclusively as a change of use except where such change of use results in increased off-street parking requirements which cannot currently be met on the site. 
E.  A site plan shall be required along with any application for a special use permit or a special use permit amendment for any nonresidential or multi-family development. 
F.  These requirements exclude the legal reconstruction of legally nonconforming buildings, when such buildings and related improvements are substantially restored to their prior condition. 
Site plan review is not required as part of planned unit development approval in chapter 9 of this title, but may apply to development of individual sites following approval of a special use planned unit development, as controlled by the ordinance granting planned unit development approval.

SECTION: 

12-4-1: - PUBLIC GROUNDS: 
Each subdivision plat shall designate such areas as may be needed for school sites, park sites or other public lands in conformance with the official plan of the city. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-2: - DEDICATION AND RESERVATION OF PUBLIC LANDS: 
A.  Dedication Of Land For Public Use: 
1.  When a final plat of a subdivision has been approved by the city council and plan commission and all other required approvals are obtained and the plat is recorded, that approval shall constitute acceptance, for the purpose designated on the plat, of all lands shown on the plat as dedicated to the public, including street dedications. 
2.  Whenever a preliminary layout includes a proposed dedication of land to public use and the plan commission finds that such land is not required or not suitable for public use, the plan commission may either refuse to approve such dedication or require the rearrangement of lots in the proposed subdivision to make such land suitable for public use. 
B.  Reservation; Preliminary Layout To Accommodate Planned Public Spaces: Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes a proposed street, highway, or parkway, or proposed site for a park, playground, school, or other public use as indicated on the official map or comprehensive plan of the city such space shall be suitably incorporated by the developer into his subdivision plat after proper determination of its necessity by the plan commission and the appropriate city office or other public agency involved in the acquisition and use of each such site. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-3: - REQUIREMENTS FOR ADEQUATE OPEN SPACES:

Floodplain Areas: The city council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course. These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading or dumping of earth, waste material or stumps. 
B.  School, Park And Playground Sites: Unless appropriate provision for dedication or donation of school, park or playground sites has been made by the city council in a previous action, such as in the case of a large scale development involving multiple land uses, any required school sites or parks or playgrounds shall be conveyed to the school board or park board or the appropriate city, county or state agency in the manner required by this Title. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-4: - ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC USE: 
The plan commission shall consider all preliminary plats and studies related thereto, to determine the need for acquisition for public use of any of the land included in the preliminary plat. Land may be acquired for: public school sites, parks, playgrounds or other public recreation areas, or other public purposes as provided by law. 
A.  Referral To Public Body: The plan commission shall refer the plat to the public body concerned with acquisition, for its consideration and report. The plan commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public body or agency thirty (30) days for reply. The agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time required to complete the acquisition. 
B.  Notice To Property Owner: Upon receipt of an affirmative report, the plan commission shall notify the property owner and shall designate on the preliminary and final plats that area proposed to be acquired by the public body. 
C.  Duration Of Land Reservation: The acquisition of land designated on the preliminary layout or final plat shall be initiated within eighteen (18) months of notification in writing, from the owner that he intends to develop the land. Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a sketch plan of the proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of the public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed eighteen (18) months shall result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the property involved and the freeing of the property for development. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-5: - DEDICATION OF PARK LANDS AND SCHOOL SITES, OR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF: 
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or of a final plat of a planned unit development within the city and within the one and one-half (11/2) miles extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, each subdivider will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes to the Geneva park district (hereinafter referred to as the park district) and land for school sites to Geneva Community Unit School District 304 (hereinafter referred to as the school district), to serve the immediate and future needs specifically and uniquely attributable to the residents of the development, or make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both at the option of the city and the respective public body, in accordance with the criteria and formulae set out in this chapter and Sections 11-12-5 and 11-12-8 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/). The City shall consult with the park and school districts when considering dedication of park lands and school sites, or payment of fees in lieu thereof. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-5-1: - CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING PARK AND RECREATION LAND DEDICATIONS: 
A.  Requirement: The ultimate population density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The subdivider shall dedicate land or the cash equivalent for park and recreation purposes in the amount of ten (10) acres per one thousand (1,000) ultimate resident population in the subdivision or development, as determined by the provisions of this title. The minimum acceptable land donation shall be three (3) acres of dry, usable land. 
For purposes of calculating park dedications, pedestrian accessways between lots thirty feet (30') wide or less and one lot deep or less shall not be considered as part of the total required dedication. For the avoidance of doubt, the intent of the City is for the park and recreation land to be laid out in a manner reasonably suitable for public use and not in awkward or gerrymandered lots which comprise unbuildable land or land reserved for storm water management purposes. 
B.  Wetlands And Other Natural Areas: Wetlands and other natural areas will be considered acceptable only when they are considered as significant in size, quality, uniqueness, containing endangered plant or animal species, or are adjacent to existing natural areas currently owned by the park district. These areas will be accepted only upon condition that the city obtains written confirmation of such acceptance from the park district. 
C.  Location: The park district master plan, as amended, adopted by the park district shall be used as a guideline in determining the general location of park sites. Generally, neighborhood park sites should be accessible to the public and serve a population within one-half (1/2) to one mile radius from the site, depending upon the classification of the park. Park sites should be located in conjunction with and adjacent to school sites whenever possible and desirable. Community parks are intended to serve a broader area and should offer a greater variety of facilities and activities. In any event, consideration should be given to the ability to combine donations from several subdividers to provide more comprehensive recreation facilities. 
D.  Credits: No school or park land dedication credit shall be given for private open space and recreation facilities within a subdivision or planned unit development. 
E.  Park Classification: Park classifications shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
Classification Minimum Size Neighborhood park 3 acres Community park 20 acres Park site combined with school site 6 acres  
F.  Consideration For Requiring Park Land Or Cash Dedications: The park district will receive a concept plan and estimates of the number of bedrooms for projected housing units, provided by the subdivider at the same time that it is submitted to the city. Copies of the plan should be reproducible on eleven by seventeen inch (11" × 17") paper. The park district will determine if land, cash in lieu of land or a combination of land and cash is appropriate based upon the following criteria: 
1.  Consideration of the location of the development and the proposed park site in relation to existing park sites; 
2.  Consideration of the master plans of the park district and the school district for school/park sites and the city's future land use plan; 
3.  Consideration of the size of the subject development and the projected population generated from that development; and 
4.  Consideration of the value of any park and recreation improvements which the subdivider may construct and convey to the park district. 
The park district shall convey its recommendation whether to accept land, cash in lieu thereof or a combination of both to the city, with copies to the subdivider, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the concept plan and estimates of the number of bedrooms for projected housing units. The city and the subdivider shall acknowledge receipt of the district's recommendation within ten (10) days of receipt. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-5-2: - CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL LAND DEDICATION: 
A.  Requirements And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. Land dedication requirements shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated number of children in each such school classification. 
B.  School Classifications And Size Of School Sites: School classifications and size of school sites within the jurisdiction of the city shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
School Classification Maximum Number of Students Minimum Number Acres of Land Elementary 525 11 Middle 600 29 Senior 1,500 53  
C.  Consideration For Requiring School Land or Cash Dedications: The school district will receive a concept plan and estimates of the number of bedrooms for projected housing units, provided by the subdivider at the same time that it is submitted to the city. Copies of the plan should be reproducible on eleven inch by seventeen inch (11" × 17") paper. The school district will determine if land or cash in lieu of land is appropriate based upon the following criteria: 
1.  Consideration of the location of the development and the proposed school site in relation to existing school sites; 
2.  Consideration of the master plan of the school district and the park district for school/park sites and the city's future land use plan; 
3.  Consideration of the size of the subject development and the projected student population generated from that development; and 
4.  Consideration of the value of the housing proposed for the subject development. 
The school district shall convey its recommendation whether to accept land or cash in lieu thereof to the city, with copies to the subdivider, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the concept plan and estimates of the number of bedrooms for projected housing units. The city and the subdivider shall acknowledge receipt of the district's recommendation within ten (10) days of receipt. 
D.  Location: In establishing the location of a proposed school site within a development, the following criteria shall be met: 
1.  Consideration should be given to the location and type of adjacent streets and highways. Both accessibility and safety considerations of the site should be studied; 
2.  Consideration should be given to the location of the subdivision relative to other schools and the feeder system to the middle and senior high schools; 
3.  Consideration should be given to nearby potential hazards and nuisances, e.g., railroad tracks or large pools of water; 
4.  Consideration should be given to bus access, ingress/egress, turn lanes, and safety for bus traffic; and 
5.  The school site should be compatible with proposed surrounding land usages and sites adjacent to park sites will be preferred. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-5-3: - RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LANDS: 
Whenever the city's comprehensive land use plan or the standards established by the park district or the school district indicate that a larger site than that required of the subdivider to be dedicated by this title is desirable, and said site is wholly within the proposed subdivision, the park district and/or school district may request the reservation of additional land adjoining the dedicated site for subsequent purchase for park or school purposes. Such request shall include the designation of specific property to be reserved on the final plat and labeled as "reserved for park purposes" or "reserved for school purposes", as may be appropriate. All requests shall be made at the time of final subdivision approval by a letter of intent stating the park district's or school district's intent to purchase the property at the fair market value. Such requests shall be made prior to consideration of final subdivision approval by the Plan Commission. Failure of the park district or school district to commence acquisition proceedings relative to such reserved lands within twelve (12) months of the approval of the final plat shall cause termination of the "reserved" designation and will release said property for further development within the subdivision regulations of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-5-4: - OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR LAND CONTRIBUTIONS: 
A.  Topography And Soils: Park sites and school sites must possess suitable topography and soil sites for the use to which they are dedicated. The subdivider shall provide the park district and/or the school district with current soil analysis tests from a minimum of one soil boring per acre to a minimum depth of fifteen feet (15'). At the request of the school district, the required number of soil borings may be concentrated in an area in anticipation of assessing soil conditions for a proposed building pad. The subdivider shall also provide the school district and/or park district with a Phase I "All Appropriate Inquiry" environmental study performed in accordance with the most recent version of ASTM Standard E1527. Any hazardous materials or underground storage tanks found on the site shall be removed by the subdivider prior to dedication and verified by producing a recorded certification of the need for "no further action" by Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. 
B.  Dimensions: Park sites should be generally rectangular in shape with dimensions generally proportioned to the ratio of a depth of three (3) to a width of two (2). This criteria shall not apply to park sites contemplated for extraordinary types of facilities such as, but not limited to, trails and shoreline frontages. 
C.  Frontage: Park sites and school sites shall have, at a minimum, adequate frontage along a publicly dedicated street to allow convenient access and, if necessary, parking facilities that will not adversely affect adjoining residential property. Generally, thirty feet (30') of frontage will be provided for every acre of land that is dedicated; provided, however, that the minimum acceptable frontage for any site will be one hundred fifty feet (150'). 
D.  Drainage: No retention/detention or other hazard that might endanger the health and well-being of school-age children shall be located within three hundred feet (300') of a proposed school or park site, unless it serves the park facility or school facility constructed on such site. 
E.  Improvement Required for Land Dedications: Park sites and school sites to be dedicated by a subdivider shall include the following land improvements prior to dedication: 
1.  Grading: Each dedicated site shall be graded to drain storm and surface water at a minimum of two percent (2%) for open areas; and slopes on berms, when berms are required, shall not exceed four to one (4:1). Grading shall include, but not be limited to: berms for separation and screening from adjoining properties; placement of six inches (6") of top soil and fine grading. The park district and school district shall provide the subdivider with engineering plans for such grading and berming and all work performed pursuant to this subsection shall be in accordance with such plans. 
2.  Utilities And Other Improvements: Each dedicated site shall be provided with the following utilities to the property line and other improvements at no cost to the park district or the school district. 
a.  Sanitary sewer adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of eight inches (8") in diameter or such greater size as may be required by the city. If the sanitary sewer service is located across the right of way from the site, the subdivider shall provide a capped service line to the property of the same size as the line located across the right of way. 
b.  Water lines adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of eight inches (8") in diameter. If the water line is across the right of way from the site, the subdivider shall provide a capped service line to the property of the same size as the line located across the right of way. 
c.  Storm sewers shall be provided at appropriate locations to properly drain the site, in accordance with the engineering plans provided by the park district and/or school district and approved by the city. 
d.  Other utilities, such as electric, gas and telecommunication shall be provided adjacent to or at the property line. 
e.  The subdivider shall seed the entire site with a blend approved by the park district or school district, as the case may be. Seeding shall include placement, watering as necessary and mowing until such time as a full stand of turf is established and accepted by the park district or school district, but not less than one full growing season. 
f.  The subdivider shall install all public walks, curbs, pavement, sewers and utilities along all site frontages as required by this title. The subdivider shall also provide a curb cut for maintenance access to the site. 
g.  The storage of overburden on a site is prohibited, although temporary storage may be granted in some cases by the park district or school district. The terms of such temporary storage shall be determined by the park district or school district, as the case may be. 
h.  Where a subdivider dedicates an entire park or school site, the subdivider shall be responsible for the design, layout and construction of storm water, sanitary sewer and water facilities to the property line of adjacent undeveloped areas. 
3.  Completion Of Improvements: All site improvements shall be completed at such time as the subdivider has obtained fifty percent (50%) of the residential building permits for the phase in which the site is located but, in no event, later than the time when fifty percent (50%) of the lots in the entire subdivision are platted. 
4.  Bonding Of Improvements: All improvements required for sites dedicated in accordance with this title shall be deemed public improvements and shall be included within all bonds, irrevocable letters of credit or escrows required by the city for other public improvements to be provided by the subdivider. The school or park district may be included as a co-obligee on the security instrument if a separate security is presented specifically for the school or park improvements required by this chapter. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-5-5: - CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING CASH CONTRIBUTIONS IN LIEU OF LAND: 
Where the subdivision or development is small and, the resulting site is, in the opinion of the city, too small to be practicable or when the available land, in the opinion of the city, is inappropriate for park and recreation purposes or school purposes, the city shall require the subdivider to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. In the event that the park district or the school district has advised the city, in accordance with Section 12-4-5-1 or 12-4-5-2, that a park or school site is necessary, or a cash contribution is necessary, two-thirds (?) vote of the aldermen of the city holding office shall be required before an alternative contribution is accepted. 
The cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land or school land shall be paid to the city which shall then pay such contributions over to the park district and the school district. Such contributions shall be held in trust by the park district and the school district solely for: a) the acquisition and/or improvement of land, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs specifically and uniquely attributable to the residents of that subdivision; b) capital site improvements to other existing park and recreation land or school land which already serves such needs (e.g., landscaping, baseball fields, soccer fields, and the like); c) technological infrastructure; or d) other capital improvements when authorized by an annexation agreement including, but not limited to, the construction of additions to existing facilities. 
A.  Fair Market Value: The city council has determined the cash fair market value per acre of land used to determine the calculations of cash contributions in lieu of land dedications, as set forth above, to be two hundred seventy five thousand dollars ($275,000.00). This value is based upon the assumption that said land is improved with the improvements and site characteristics delineated and required in section 12-4-5-4 of this chapter for school and park sites. This value shall be updated every three (3) years based upon an appraisal agreed upon by the city, school district, and park district. 
A subdivider may appeal the established land value by submitting a professional appraisal of the property within or in the vicinity of the subject development which includes the land improvements and site characteristics delineated in section 12-3-5 of this title. A determination of an appeal for the purposes of a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication shall be made by the city council based upon the evidence presented and such other sources as may be submitted to the city council by the park district, the school district or other interested parties, as the case may be. 
B.  Calculation And Timing Of Cash Contributions: All cash contribution calculations shall be made by the city based upon information provided by the subdivider. Cash contributions shall be paid at the time of the approval of the final plat of subdivision unless otherwise permitted by the park district and/or school district to be paid at the time of building permit. Cash contributions paid at the time of building permit shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect the actual number of bedrooms if different than the estimated number of bedrooms. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-5-6: - CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING LAND DEDICATION AND CASH CONTRIBUTIONS: 
There may be situations where a combination of land dedications and cash contributions are necessary. These occasions may arise, among others, when: 
A.  It is determined by the city, in consultation with the school district or park district in accordance with Section 12-4-5-1 or 12-4-5-2, that the land to be dedicated for a park site or school site within a development contains fewer acres than the amount called for by this title, in which event a cash contribution shall be required for the difference between the amount of land called for by this title and the amount of land which is actually to be dedicated; or 
B.  A major part of a park site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site, in which event a cash contribution shall be required for the difference between the amount of land called for by this title and the amount of land which is actually to be dedicated. Alternatively, additional public improvements equal in value to the cash contribution may be constructed and dedicated by the subdivider on the site when the school district or park district consent thereto. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018) 
12-4-5-7: - METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING DEDICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS: 
Park acreage requirement shall be calculated by multiplying the number of housing units in each size/type category by the total population multiplier for each category. The resulting products shall be multiplied by the land multiplier for parks. The final product shall be the park acreage required for the proposed subdivision or development. 
School acreage requirements shall be calculated by multiplying the number of housing units in each size/type category by each student multiplier for each school category. The number of students for each school category shall then be multiplied by the land multiplier to each school type. The resulting products for all school categories shall be the total school acreage required for the proposed subdivision or development. 
The amount of cash contribution in lieu of land shall be determined by multiplying the required acreage for parks and schools by the established fair market value as set forth in section 12-4-5-5 of this chapter. 
Existing housing units that are part of a proposed subdivision or planned unit development that are proposed to remain in place shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating dedications and contributions. Existing housing units that are part of a proposed subdivision or planned unit development that are proposed to be demolished/removed shall be credited in the calculation of dedications and contributions. The methodology, density formula, and fair market value contained in this chapter shall be used to determine the amount of land and/or cash contribution to be credited. 
Housing units that are proposed to be age restricted shall be exempt from the dedications and contributions required for the school district if the subdivider can provide evidence that persons under fifty-five (55) years of age would not be permitted to reside in the subdivision or planned unit development. In the event that a subdivision or planned unit development should remove an age restriction, the school district may petition to receive dedications and/or contributions in accordance with the methodology, density formula, and fair market value contained in this chapter, as amended from time to time. Age restricted subdivisions or planned unit developments shall not be exempt from the dedications and contributions required for the park district. (1975 Code App. C § 204; Ord. No. 2018-02, § 2, 2-5-2018)

The regulatory floodways are designated for the Fox River on the flood boundary and floodway map prepared by FEMA (or HUD community panel numbers 170325 0001-0003) and dated August 3, 1981. The regulatory floodways for those parts of unincorporated Kane County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city that may be annexed into the city are designated for the Fox River on the flood boundary and floodway map prepared by FEMA (or HUD) and dated March 1, 1982, community panel number 170896 0045. To locate the regulatory floodway boundary on any site, the regulatory floodway boundary should be scaled off the regulatory floodway map and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the regulatory floodway boundary, the division should be contacted for the interpretation. REPAIR, 
REMODELING OR 
MAINTENANCE: Development activities which do not result in any increases in the outside dimensions of a building or any changes to the dimensions of a structure. RETENTION/ 
DETENTION 
FACILITY: A retention facility stores stormwater runoff without a gravity release. A detention facility provides for storage of stormwater runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a flood or storm. RIVERINE 
SFHA: Any SFHA subject to flooding from a river, creek, intermittent stream, ditch, on stream lake system or any other identified channel. This term does not include areas subject to flooding from lakes, ponding areas, areas of sheet flow, or other areas not subject to overbank flooding. RUNOFF: The water derived from melting snow or rain falling on the land surface, flowing over the surface of the ground or collected in channels or conduits. SEDIMENTATION: The processes that deposit soils, debris and other materials either on other ground surfaces or in bodies of water. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): Any base flood area subject to flooding from a river, creek, intermittent stream, ditch, or any other identified channel or ponding and shown on a flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V30, VE, V, M, or E. STRUCTURE: The results of a manmade change to the land constructed on or below the ground, including the construction, reconstruction or placement of a building or any addition to a building; installing a manufactured home on a site; preparing a site for a manufactured home or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days. SUBSTANTIAL 
IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure either: a) before the improvement or repair is started; or b) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: a) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or b) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. TRANSITION 
SECTION: Reaches of the stream or floodway where water flows from a narrow cross section to a wide cross section or vice versa. (1975 Code § 8-300; amd. 2003 Code)

13-1-5: - BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS: 
This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for the city. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois state water survey's flood plain information repository. When a party disagrees with the best available data, he may finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to DWR and FEMA. (1975 Code § 8-600.0) 
A.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of the Fox River and Geneva Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of the city prepared by FEMA (or HUD) and dated February 3, 1981, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.

(1975 Code § 8-602.0) 
C.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH zone" or "AO zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the city. (1975 Code § 8-603.0) 
D.  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the flood insurance rate map of the city, shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois state water survey flood plain information repository. When no base flood or 100 year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States geological survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to DWR for approval, once approved it must be submitted to the Illinois state water survey floodplain information repository for filing. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the Illinois state water survey. (1975 Code § 8-604.0) 
13-1-6: - OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS: 
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is by proper elevation, and compensatory storage and other provisions of this chapter are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of section 13-1-9 of this chapter. (1975 Code § 8-700.0) 
A.  Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the director of public works. (1975 Code § 8-701.0) 
1.  Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the director of public works. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor, existing grade elevations in M.S.L., 1929 adj. datum or NGVD and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section 13-1-9 of this chapter. (1975 Code § 8-701.1) 
2.  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the director of public works shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the sites first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The director of public works shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. (1975 Code § 8-701.2) 
3.  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post construction maintenance. (1975 Code § 8-701.3) 
4.  The director of public works shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant, copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit not required letters that maybe required for this type of activity. The director of public works shall not issue a permit unless all other local, state and federal permits have been obtained. (1975 Code § 8-701.4) 
B.  Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. (1975 Code § 8-702.0) 
1.  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. (1975 Code § 8-702.1) 
2.  Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. (1975 Code § 8-702.2) 
13-1-7: - OCCUPATION AND USE OF IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS:

13-1-7-2: - PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES; APPROPRIATE USES: 
A.  Allowable Development: The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Illinois administrative code 708 will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
1.  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife; 
2.  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses; 
3.  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls; 
4.  Underground and overhead utilities; 
5.  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions; 
6.  Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage; 
7.  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto; 
8.  Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot) and aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation; 
9.  Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse; 
10.  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure; 
11.  In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced, and which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building; 
12.  Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase the building's foot print and are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the building. (1975 Code § 8-802.0) 
B.  Appropriate Uses: Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by DWR, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 13-1-9 of this chapter: 
1.  Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
a.  Regulatory floodway conveyance; 
K = 1.486 
N AR 2/3  
where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York). 
b.  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
c.  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that are more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(1)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length. 
(2)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length. 
(3)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length shall be used. 
(4)  Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
(5)  All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
2.  Preservation Of Floodway Storage So Not To Increase Downstream Flooding: Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and one-half (11/2) times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to DWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure. 
3.  Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream Erosion Or Flood Heights: For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures. 
4.  Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway Approaches: The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth of a foot (0.1') when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequent event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth of one foot (0.1'), the developer must contact DWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver. 
a.  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 13-1-5 of this chapter. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA hydraulic chart for the selection of highway culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/federal highway administration hydraulics of bridge waterways calculation procedures. 
b.  Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection B2 of this section. 
c.  Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection B3 of this section. 
d.  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a department of transportation permit must be received. 
e.  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to DWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by section 13-1-7-2 of this chapter. 
f.  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection B8 of this section. 
5.  Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts And Approach Roads: 
a.  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth of one foot (0.1') increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
b.  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
c.  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with the department of transportation rules, 92 Illinois administrative code 708 (floodway construction in northeastern illinois) and submitted to the division for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
6.  On-Stream Structures Built For Purpose Of Backing Up Water: Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero foot (0.0') when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from DWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 13-1-2 of this chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Illinois administrative code 702 (construction and maintenance of dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
a.  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation or regional stormwater detention; 
b.  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
c.  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and presedimentation basin. 
d.  A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
e.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 13-1-7 of this chapter. 
7.  Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial Structures: If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
8.  Excavation In Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
a.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length; 
b.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length; and 
c.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length shall be used; 
d.  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
9.  Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
a.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
b.  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
c.  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
(1)  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
(2)  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
(3)  One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
(4)  Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
(5)  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high Velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
(6)  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanked or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
(7)  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
(8)  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
(9)  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
(10)  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
(11)  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
d.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 13-1-7 of this chapter. 
10.  Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
11.  Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
a.  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
b.  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not beat final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days. 
c.  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches and sediment basins. 
d.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing channels (see subsection B16 of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
e.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois (1988) also known as the green book and "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control" (IEPA, 1987). 
12.  Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to DWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
13.  General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations: 
a.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in section 13-1-5 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, DWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
b.  If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
c.  If the applicant learns from DWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five (5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
14.  Conditional Letter Of Map Revision: If the appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to DWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from DWR a conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by DWR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA and DWR. In the case of nongovernmental projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before DWR approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA and DWR. 
15.  Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
16.  Floodway Activities: For all activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25') of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
a.  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
b.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
c.  The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary for stream maintenance purposes. 
After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use maybe placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by DWR and FEMA of the as-built plans. (1975 Code § 8-802.1) 
C.  State Review: For those projects listed below located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to DWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit: 
1.  DWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection B4 of this section. 
2.  DWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection B5 of this section. 
3.  The DWR will review alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to subsections B1, B2 and B8 of this section. 
4.  The DWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction any department projects, dams (as defined in section 13-1-2 of this chapter) and all other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the city or county. (1975 Code § 8-802.2) 
D.  Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from DWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq. No permit from DWR shall be required if the division has delegated this responsibility to the city. (1975 Code § 8-802.3) 
E.  Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in section 13-1-2 of this chapter, per 92 Illinois administrative code 702 (rules for construction of dams) shall obtain an Illinois division of water resources dam safety permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the director of public works finds a dam that does not have an DWR permit, the director of public works shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the division of water resources. If the director of public works finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the director of public works shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, DWR, dam safety section in Springfield and the Illinois emergency management agency (EMA). (1975 Code § 8-802.4) 
F.  Activities That Do Not Require A Registered Professional Engineer's Review: The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements: 
1.  Underground and overhead utilities that: 
a.  Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or 
b.  Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway; or 
c.  In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet (3') below the existing stream bed; and 
d.  In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris. 
2.  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that: 
a.  Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope; and 
b.  Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and 
c.  Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall location. 
3.  Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences), properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade. 
4.  Construction of shoreline and streambank protection that:

b.  Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank. 
c.  Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake. 
d.  Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble, and gabions should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
5.  Temporary stream crossings in which: 
a.  The approach roads will be one-half foot (1/2') or less above natural grade. 
b.  The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or outfall invert.

d.  All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of construction. 
e.  The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization. (1975 Code § 8-802.5) 
13-1-8: - OCCUPATION AND USE OF SFHA AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS NOT IDENTIFIED: 
In SFHA or floodplains, where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. (1975 Code § 8-900.0) 
A.  Development Permits: 
1.  No person, firm, corporation or governmental body, not exempted by state law, shall commence any development in a SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the director of public works. Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the director of public works. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions, and existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevations of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section 13-1-9 of this chapter. 
The application for a development permit shall also include the following information:

c.  Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity; 
d.  Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a minimum: 
(1)  A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic or numerical scale, and north arrow; 
(2)  A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment) datum or NGVD, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross sections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale; 
(3)  Cross section views of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood elevation and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and 
(4)  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post construction maintenance. 
e.  Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of subsection 13-1-8B of this section. 
f.  Any and all other local, state and federal permits or approvals that may be required for this type of development. (1975 Code § 8-901.1) 
2.  Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois state water survey's floodplain information repository, the city engineer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to subsection 13-1-5D of this chapter. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the sites first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The director of public works shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. (1975 Code § 8-901.2) 
3.  The director of public works shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits, approvals or permit not required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The director of public works shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have been obtained. The city engineer shall review and approve applications under this section prior to issuance of the development permit by the director of public works. (1975 Code § 8-901.3) 
B.  Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. (1975 Code § 8-902.0) 
1.  Standards: Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply: 
a.  The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations, and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of subsections 13-1-7-2B1 through B8 of this chapter for the entire floodplain as calculated under the provisions of subsection 13-1-5D of this chapter. As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to DWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of their floodway by the department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of section 13-1-7 of this chapter for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to the definition in section 13-1-2 of this chapter. 
b.  A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit from DWR or written documentation that a permit is not required from DWR. 
c.  No permit from DWR shall be required if the division has delegated permit responsibility to the city, per 92 Illinois administrative code, part 708 for regulatory floodways, per DWR statewide permit entitled construction in floodplains with no designated floodways in northeastern Illinois. 
d.  Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water as defined in section 13-1-2 of this chapter shall obtain an Illinois division of water resources dam safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not required prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the director of public works finds a dam that does not have an DWR permit, the director of public works shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the division of water resources. If the director of public works finds which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the director of public works shall immediately notify the owner of the dam and the Illinois emergency management agency (EMA) and the DWR, dam safety section in Springfield. 
e.  The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and regulatory floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this chapter:

(9)  The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not increase the first floor area by more than twenty percent (20%), which are located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and which do not extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the flow of flood waters; 
(10)  Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where: 
(A)  The affected length of stream is less than one thousand feet (1,000'); 
(B)  The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural stream channels; or 
(C)  The cross sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site. 
f.  The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. (1975 Code § 8-902.1) 
2.  Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavations volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. (1975 Code § 8-902.2) 
13-1-9: - REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN AREAS AND PROTECTION OF BUILDINGS: 
In addition to the requirements found in sections 13-1-6, 13-1-7 and 13-1-8 of this chapter for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways, and SFHA or floodplains where no floodways have been identified (zones A, AO, AH, AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M or E), the following requirements shall be met: (1975 Code § 8-1000.0)
