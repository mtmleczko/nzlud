PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Paducah, Kentucky. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1997 Code Code, as supplemented through November 15, 2016, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. Sections of the Code bear the same section numbers as found in the 1997 Code, as supplemented through November 15, 2016. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can certain ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Jean B. Lindsay, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Tammara S. Sanderson, City Clerk, Ms. Lindsay Parish, Assistant City Clerk, and Mr. W. David Denton, Denton Law Firm, PLLC, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Chapter 20 - BUSINESSES 
ARTICLE I. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

Sec. 20-1. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations relating to sexually oriented businesses. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in reports made available to the Board of Commissioners, and in findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Play Time Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young vs. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Houston, Texas, Indianapolis, Indiana, Amarillo, Texas, Garden Grove, California, Los Angeles, California, Whittier, California, Austin, Texas, Seattle, Washington, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Cleveland, Ohio, and Beaumont, Texas, and also on findings from the report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Board of Commissioners finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented business defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidents of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non-A, non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. Through December 31, 1997, there have been six hundred nineteen thousand, six hundred ninety (619,690) reported cases of AIDS in the United States. 
(8)  As of December 31, 1997, there have been two thousand, five hundred eighty-three (2,583) reported cases of AIDS in the Commonwealth. 
(9)  The Surgeon General of the United States in a report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(10)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(11)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films. 
(12)  The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (11) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(13)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(14)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on-premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(15)  The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the City will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

    In the event the City directly or indirectly through any legal means constructs, acquires, purchases, leases or otherwise owns or controls a cable system, it shall, with the exception of those requirements pertaining to application for and obtaining a franchise, be considered a franchisee for purposes of this chapter and shall be bound by and comply with all the requirements of this chapter as if it were a franchisee.

Sec. 22-31. - Franchise required. 
(a)  Necessity of franchise.

(b)  Exception for City-owned or City-controlled cable system. Under judicial interpretations of the Kentucky Commonwealth Constitution, a municipality may own and operate a cable system. Consequently, should the City, directly or indirectly, through any legal means available to the City, decide to purchase, acquire, construct, lease, control or otherwise own a cable system within the territorial limits of the City, then the City shall not be required to submit a proposal for or receive a franchise in order to construct, operate and maintain a cable system within the territorial limits of the City. 
(c)  Contravention of franchise; costs of litigation. The cost of any litigation incurred by the City to enforce this article or the franchise granted pursuant hereto, or any franchise agreement, or in relation thereto, or in relation to the cancellation or termination of a franchise, shall be reimbursed to the City by the affected franchisee if the City prevails in the litigation. In the event the franchisee prevails, the cost of litigation incurred by the franchisee shall be reimbursed to the franchisee by the City. Such costs shall include, but not be limited to, filing fees, costs of depositions, discovery, and expert witnesses, all other expenses of suit, and a reasonable attorney's fee.

(a)  Maximum term. No franchise granted hereunder, or any renewal thereof, shall be for a term of more than fifteen (15) years. 
(b)  Term six (6) years or less. If an initial franchise or renewal franchise is for a period of six (6) years or less, then the franchise agreement shall explain the reasons for granting the shorter franchise term.

In addition to all other rights and powers of the City by virtue of the franchise or this article, the City may, subject to and in accordance with appropriate terms of this article and a franchise agreement, Federal, and State law, terminate and cancel the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchisee thereunder in the event that the franchisee either: 
(1)  Substantially violates any material provisions of the franchise or this article, or any legal rule, order or determination of the Board of Commissioners made pursuant thereto, where such violation shall remain uncured for a period of thirty (30) days subsequent to receipt by franchisee of written notice of said violation, except where such violation is not the fault of the franchisee or is due to excusable neglect; 
(2)  Intentionally evades any of the provisions of this article or the franchise agreement or practices any intentional fraud or deceit upon the City; or 
(3)  Becomes insolvent, files bankruptcy or abandons the franchise or, subject to section 12-79, fails to pay any applicable franchise fee when due. 
Such determination and cancellation shall be made by ordinance of the Board of Commissioners duly adopted after twenty (20) days' notice to the franchisee and shall in no way affect any of the City's rights under the franchise or any provisions of law; provided, however, that, before the franchise may be terminated and canceled under this section, the franchisee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard at a public hearing before the Board of Commissioners, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the franchisee of the time and place of the public hearing; provided further that the notice shall affirmatively and with specificity cite the reasons alleged to constitute a cause for revocation; and, provided further, that notice of the public hearing shall be published in a local newspaper of general circulation at least five (5) days before the hearing. 
(e)  Performance evaluation provisions. 
(1)  The City and franchisee shall hold scheduled performance evaluation sessions within thirty (30)-days prior to the fifth and tenth anniversary dates of granting a franchise or renewal of a franchise. All performance evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and will be announced by the City in a newspaper of general circulation at least five (5) days before each session. 
(2)  Special performance evaluation sessions may be held at any time during the term of the franchise, provided that both the City and the franchisee shall mutually agree on the time, the place and the topics to be negotiated. 
(Code 1997, § 22-32; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-33. - Selection of new franchisee. 
(a)  Request for proposal. In selecting a new franchisee (not applicable to a proposed transferee) pursuant to this article, the City shall prepare a request for proposal to seek bids for a cable system to be established under a franchise by the City. This request for proposal shall contain, among other things, detailed information and instructions relating to the preparation and filing of proposals; technical standards regarding the installation, operation and maintenance of a cable system; financial ability and stability to construct, operate, and maintain a cable system; history of legal compliance with other types of franchise agreements and commitment to comply with the legal requirements of the City; and the criteria to be used in evaluation of applicant proposals. However, as noted in section 22-31(b), should the City directly or indirectly, through any legal means available to the City, decide to purchase, acquire, construct, lease, control or otherwise own a cable system, then the City shall not be required to submit a proposal. 
(b)  Criteria for selection of franchisee. Applicants for a new franchise shall be evaluated according to the following criteria: 
(1)  Nonprofit ownership. A preference shall be given to applicants for a franchise representing nonprofit organizations. 
(2)  Service priorities.

Preference shall be given to system provisions for two (2) way non-voice communications. Preference shall be given to the maximum total channels provided by the system. 
(3)  Installation plan. A preference may be given to an installation plan that would provide flexibility needed to adjust to new developments, maintenance practices, and services that would be available to the subscriber and the community immediately and in the future. 
(4)  Financial soundness and capability.

(5)  Demonstrated experience in operating a cable system under city franchise. Preference shall be given upon satisfactory evidence of the applicant's experience in operating a cable system under a City franchise, where such evidence would show or tend to show or confirm the ability of the applicant to furnish sufficient and dependable service to the potential public and users. 
(6)  Educational program. A preference shall be given to a system which presents a program whereby the City's public schools may benefit, utilize and develop education programs for students and subscribers. 
(7)  Award of new franchise; hearing; publication of ordinances. The Board of Commissioners may award a new franchise to an applicant only after a public hearing on the application and proposal, notice of which hearing shall be published in a local newspaper of general circulation at least twenty (20) days before the date of the hearing.

Sec. 22-35. - Franchise conditions. 
    All franchises granted pursuant to this article shall be subject to, and shall expressly indicate that they are subject to, the following provisions: 
(1)  Any franchise granted hereunder shall be subject to the right of the City, by appropriate action of its Board of Commissioners, to revoke the franchise for cause shown pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or the applicable law of the Commonwealth or the United States of America. 
(2)  Any franchise granted hereunder shall be subject to all generally applicable provisions of city ordinances and any amendments thereto.

(Code 1997, § 22-35; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-36. - Franchise agreement. 
(a)  Every franchisee shall enter into a franchise agreement with the City which details the rights, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of both parties, and which contains an acceptance on the part of the applicant or franchisee to the terms of this article and the franchise agreement. Moreover, a new franchisee may not lay any cable until the franchise agreement is executed by both the new franchisee and the City. 
(b)  In addition to those matters required elsewhere in this article to be included in the franchise agreement, it must contain the following express representations of the franchisee that: 
(1)  It accepts and agrees to all the provisions of this article as to construction, technical standards, operation, and maintenance and rate structures, if permitted by law, which the City may include in the franchise agreement. In the case of a franchise renewal, the franchise agreement may include exceptions to this article. 
(2)  It has examined all the provisions of this article. 
(3)  It recognizes the right of the City to make reasonable amendments to this article, consistent with the City's police powers, during the term of the franchise upon thirty (30) days' notice to the franchisee. 
(4)  It recognizes and agrees that it may be considered as a franchisee for the purposes of this article. 
(5)  It expressly recognizes and agrees that it has considered all the provisions of this article in regard to resolution of disputes, and agrees to be bound by same throughout the term of the franchise. 
(c)  No franchise shall be exclusive and no franchisee shall, through the grant of a franchise, be given an unfair competitive advantage over other franchised cable operators providing cable service in the City. 
(d)  Every franchise agreement shall specifically set forth the specific standards which the franchisee must maintain in respect to signal quality requirements and technical standards of construction, operation, and maintenance of the system. 
(e)  The franchise agreement shall contain such further conditions or provisions as may be included in the request for proposal and/or negotiated between the City and the franchisee. In the case of a conflict between any terms or provisions of the franchise agreement and this article, the words of the franchise shall be deemed to control. 
(f)  Any application filed for an initial franchise shall become a part of the franchise agreement and any representations, promises, commitments or volunteered parameters and/or standards shall become binding upon the franchisee and its heirs and assigns. 
(Code 1997, § 22-36; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-37. - Operational standards. 
(a)  State of the art; maintaining system to level of current technology. The City may require a franchisee, during the term of its franchise, to construct, maintain and operate a cable system that is at a level that reflects the current technology utilized within the industry. Consequently, the City may (upon the recommendation of the Authority) request that a franchisee's franchise provide for measures that require a franchisee to construct, maintain and operate a cable system that conforms to the current technological standards of the industry. 
(b)  Construction standards and technical requirements. 
(1)  Methods of construction, installation, maintenance and repair of any cable system shall comply with the National Electrical Safety Code. 
(2)  It shall be the duty of a franchisee to undertake a preventative maintenance of the cable system in order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the cable system that would affect the citizens' health, safety or welfare, or negatively affect the quality of the cable services being provided. 
(3)  All wires, conduits, cable, and other property and facilities of a franchisee shall be so located, constructed, installed and maintained so as to not endanger or unnecessarily interfere with usual and customary use, traffic, and travel upon the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the community. 
(4)  In the event a franchisee's system creates a hazardous or unsafe condition, or an unreasonable interference with public property, then, at its own expense, the franchisee shall, with a reasonable time, voluntarily, or upon the written request of the City, correct or remove that part of the system that creates the hazardous condition from the subject property. 
(5)  A franchisee shall not place equipment where it will interfere with the rights of private property owners or with gas, electric or telephone fixtures, or with water hydrants or mains, or with wastewater lift stations, or any other service or facility in the public ways that benefits the City's or its residents' health, safety or welfare. 
(6)  Subject to reasonable prior written notice, it shall be the responsibility of a franchisee (acting alone or in conjunction with another person) to locate and mark or otherwise visibly indicate and alert others to the location of underground cable (or its equivalent) and other utility lines before employees, agents or independent contractors of a franchisee install cable in a marked-off area. 
(7)  A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit, temporarily remove, raise or lower the cable to allow the moving of the building. The expense of temporary removal shall be borne by the person requesting it, and the franchisee may require advance payment. The franchisee shall be given not less than ten (10) days' advance written notice in order to facilitate the temporary cable changes. 
(8)  A franchisee, at either its own expense, or that of a private contractor, shall protect rights-of-way and easements, and support or temporarily disconnect, remove or relocate in the same street or other public way any property of the franchisee when necessitated by reason of: traffic conditions; public safety; a street closing; street construction or resurfacing; change or establishment of street grade; installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, storm sewers, storm drains, lift stations, force mains, power or traffic signal lines; or any improvement, construction or repair related to the City's or its residents' health, safety, or welfare. If the City requests the relocation, removal or reinstallation of franchisee's property in any of the public ways in the franchise area for the sole purpose of installing or providing cable services in competition with franchisee, the cost of such relocation, removal or reinstallation shall not be borne by franchisee but by the City. 
(9)  Prior to a franchisee's commencing to attach wire, cable (coaxial, fiber or its functional equivalent) or other fixtures and appurtenances to poles or towers located within the City, it shall execute license agreements for pole attachments with the appropriate utility. 
(10)  The franchisee shall not discriminate nor permit discrimination between or among any persons in the availability of cable services provided in connection with the cable system in the service area. It shall be the right of all persons to continuously receive all available service provided on the cable system so long as such person's financial or other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied. Moreover, the City states that density, proximity and geography, and not economic status, should be the primary factors used to determine whether a franchisee should provide service to one (1) or more persons within a part of a franchisee's franchise area. 
(11)  A franchisee shall create, maintain and provide to the City on an annual basis, cable system route maps. Complete and accurate system maps, which shall include, but not be limited to, detail of trunks, distribution lines, and nodes shall be available at franchisee's office for the City's review. 
(12)  A franchisee shall construct, operate, maintain, repair, remove, replace or restore the cable system in strict compliance with all current generally applicable codes adopted by the City. The codes referred to specifically include, but are not limited to, construction, fire and safety codes. 
(13)  A franchisee shall obtain, at its expense, all permits and licenses (including pole attachment agreements) required by law, rule, regulation or local law, and maintain the same in full force and effect for as long as required. 
(Code 1997, § 22-37; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-38. - Number of channels. 
    The precise channel capacity that a franchisee must maintain during the term of the franchise shall be detailed in the franchise agreement. 
(Code 1997, § 22-38; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-39. - Use of channels. 
(a)  The City recognizes that pursuant to 47 USC 531, the City has certain authority with respect to certain aspects for public, educational or governmental access channel use. 
(b)  To the extent permitted by law, and in order to fulfill the City's desired goal of achieving a EG access channel policy that will facilitate the long-range needs of the City, the Board of Commissioners adopts the following: 
(1)  At the time of an initial application or proposal, and unless otherwise provided in a franchise agreement or subsequent renewal franchise agreement, a franchisee shall pledge to include the following: 
a.  A franchisee shall provide, at its own expense, one (1) educational access channel that is available for providing non-commercial, educational programming. 
b.  A franchisee shall provide, at its own expense, one (1) public access channel that is available for providing non-commercial public access, senior citizen, and library programming. 
c.  A franchisee shall provide, at its own expense, one (1) governmental access channel that is available for providing noncommercial governmental programming. 
(2)  If at any time eighty (80) percent of the total time allocated for a required EG access channel is consistently used eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days a week for a period of three (3) consecutive months with non-character generated, non-repetitive programming, then, upon one hundred twenty (120) days' written request, the franchisee shall provide one (1) additional EG access channel. 
(3)  All programming transmitted over EG access channels shall be non-commercial in nature. Program material to be distributed on EG access channels shall contain no advertising or commercial content for which consideration is received by city. Franchisee and city agree that city or the producer or distributor of such programming may include acknowledgments for persons which sponsor or underwrite access programming in a manner substantially similar to the sponsorship information provided on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). 
(c)  Unless otherwise provided in a franchise, a franchisee shall provide: 
(1)  Both mobile, portable and stationary equipment to be used for access channel programming, together with the aid of technical and production assistance provided by the franchisee; 
(2)  Equipment that can store programs for delayed cablecasting; and 
(3)  Technical production assistance required for EG access use that may extend to, but not exceed, fifty (50) actual production manhours per year. 
(d)  Unless otherwise specified in a franchise, the City shall develop a plan for handling requests for use of EG access channels, facilities or programming. Such a plan shall be nondiscriminatory in nature and should encourage joint or cooperative efforts on the part of potential users. However, the City recognizes that, while citizens enjoy considerable first amendment freedoms, these freedoms, nonetheless, must be weighed against the legitimate health, safety and welfare interests of all citizens in the service area. Consequently, when a request for access time is made by a culturally unpopular, politically controversial, or racially/ethnically/religiously intolerant organization, the City may require safeguards which minimize or lessen the possibility and probability that such espoused viewpoints will damage the community fabric. The City may declare the speech is culturally obscene in that it was or would be so morally devoid or culturally offensive that it either dramatically reduced the overall value of other services provided on the cable system or posed a discernible risk of disrupting the spiritual, political or racial fabric of the community. However, the safeguards imposed may only be as much as is necessary to accomplish the City's objectives. The safeguards include restricting such programming to non-primetime hours (before 7:00 p.m. and after 12:00 midnight) and allowing the audio, but not video, of such programming to be provided over the EG access channel. For purposes of this article, a culturally unpopular, politically controversial, or racially/ethnically/religiously intolerant organization is one whose viewpoints or displays have no redeeming social, historical or artistic value, and undermine the community fabric. 
(Code 1997, § 22-39; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-40. - Public service installations. 
    The franchisee shall, without charge for installation, maintenance or service, make standard installations consisting of one (1) drop and one (1) outlet at City Hall, the Paducah Public Library, each fire and police station, and each public and private accredited K-12 school within the City located within two hundred fifty (250) feet of franchisee's existing distribution cable. Such installations shall be made at such reasonable locations as shall be requested by the respective units of government or educational institutions and shall include one (1) converter, without charge, per installation, if necessary. Any charge for relocation of such installation shall, however, be charged at franchisee's current rate for such work. Additional installations at the same location shall be made by franchisee at franchisee's current rate for such work. No monthly service charges shall be imposed for basic cable service and expanded basic cable service (or the future equivalent) signals within such publicly owned buildings. 
(Code 1997, § 22-40; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-41. - Right of City to purchase system. 
(a)  Purchase upon expiration of term. Subject to section 626 of the CCPA (47 USC 546), other applicable law, and with the consent of franchisee, upon expiration of the term of the franchise, the City, at its selection, and upon payment to the franchisee of a price equal to the fair market value of the system as a going concern, including physical assets and intangibles, including good will, in accordance with the accepted and usual industry practices (except the valuation of the franchise privilege itself), shall be given the opportunity to purchase the system. 
(b)  Purchase upon default. Upon lawful termination of the franchise rights as provided for by this section or by law occasioned by the substantial breach of provisions of the franchise agreement or this article and with the consent of franchisee, the City, at its selection and upon payment to the franchisee of a price equal to the fair market value of the system as a going concern, including physical assets and intangibles, including good will, in accordance with accepted and usual industry practices (except that the valuation shall not include any valuation of the franchise privilege itself), shall be given the opportunity to purchase the system. In the case of the City's purchase of the system and the circumstances, the franchise shall transfer to the City possession and title to all facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable system business, free from any and all liens and encumbrances. This provision, however, may be waived by the City at its option, in whole or in part. 
(Code 1997, § 22-41; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-42. - Transactions affecting ownership or control of franchise facilities. 
(a)  To protect the interest of the City under any franchise granted pursuant to this article, the franchisee shall not transfer, transfer control, or otherwise assign the cable system or franchise to a third party without adherence to the provisions of subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section: 
(1)  Without the express approval of the Board of Commissioners, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; and 
(2)  Without a written assent filed with the Board of Commissioners binding upon the person in whom any right, power, privilege, duty, title, interest, claim or demand in or to the franchise or the system is created or vested, to the effect that such right, power, privilege, duty, title, interest, claim or demand is and shall be held and exercised subject to all the terms and provisions of the franchise, including this article. The Board of Commissioners may require such written assent to be contained in any instrument or document creating or vesting such right, power, privilege, duty, title, interest, claim or demand. Provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply to the disposition of worn-out or obsolete facilities or personal property in the normal course of carrying out the cable system business. 
(b)  Prior approval of the Board of Commissioners shall be required for any sale, transfer, exchange or assignment of stock in franchisee, or franchisee's parent corporation or any other entity having a controlling interest in franchisee, so as to create a new controlling interest therein, shall be subject to the requirements of this section. The term "controlling interest" as used herein is not limited to majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. 
(c)  No franchise may be transferred unless such transfer is approved by the Board of Commissioners, by ordinance, after public hearing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. No such approval shall be required, however, for: 
(1)  A transfer in trust, by mortgage, hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the franchisee in a franchise or the cable system in order to secure indebtedness; or 
(2)  An internal transfer to an entity directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the parent corporation of franchisee. The City shall process all requests in accordance with applicable FCC regulations and other applicable laws. 
(d)  By its acceptance of a franchise, the franchisee specifically concedes and agrees that any acquisitions or transfers set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, without prior approval of the Board as may be required, shall constitute a violation of the franchise and this article by the franchisee. 
(Code 1997, § 22-42; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-43. - Receivership; foreclosure. 
(a)  Any franchise shall, at the option of the Board of Commissioners, cease and terminate one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trustee shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of the one hundred twenty (120) days or unless: 
(1)  The receivers or trustees shall have, within one hundred twenty (120) days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this article and the franchise, and the receivers or trustees within the one hundred twenty (120) days shall have remedied all defaults, if any, under the franchise; and 
(2)  The receivers or trustees shall, within the one hundred twenty (120) days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises whereby the receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of a franchise. 
(b)  In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, property, and equipment of the franchise, or any part thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the Board of Commissioners or its designee may serve notice of termination upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of franchisee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty (30) days after service of such notice, unless: 
(1)  The Board of Commissioners shall have approved the transfer of the franchise as and in the manner in this article provided; and 
(2)  Unless the successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the City to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise. 
(Code 1997, § 22-43; Ord. No. 2006-10-7183, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Sec. 22-44. - City's right of intervention; resolution of disputes. 
(a)  City's right of intervention. The franchisee shall not oppose intervention by the City, at the City's expense, in any suit or proceeding to which the franchisee is a party. 
(b)  Resolution of disputes. 
(1)  Intent. It is the intent of the City to provide for the orderly resolution of any controversy or dispute between the franchisee and the City arising out of the enforcement or interpretation of any provision of this article, the franchise agreement, or any rule, regulation or procedure relating to cable communication matters. Unless otherwise provided for in a franchise agreement, negotiation between the parties and fact finding shall be the means of resolving the great majority of such controversies or disputes. Neither fact finding nor mediation, however, shall be the first resort of the parties, but shall be undertaken only after a reasonable time has been taken to reach agreement by negotiation between the parties. 
(2)  Fact finding. Any material controversy or dispute, upon the election of both the City and the franchisee, may be submitted to an expert individual acceptable to both parties for an investigation of the facts and a report thereof. Such fact finding shall be for the purpose of developing better information for the use of both parties and shall not be binding on either party. All reasonable fees and other expenses resulting from such fact finding shall be equally borne by both the City and the franchisee. 
(3)  Mediation.

For any installation that is not a free installation or a standard installation, franchisee shall provide the subscriber with a written estimate of all charges within seven (7) days of a request by the subscriber.

(f)  The City Manager or designated representative may issue guidelines defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a special variance.

ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 50-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS ch. 100 delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the City hereby adopts the floodplain management ordinance of this article. 
(Code 1997, § 50-31; Ord. No. 2011-10-7871, § 2, 10-25-2011) 
Sec. 50-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation, which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1997, § 50-32; Ord. No. 2011-10-7871, § 2, 10-25-2011) 
Sec. 50-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas. 
(Code 1997, § 50-33; Ord. No. 2011-10-7871, § 2, 10-25-2011) 
Sec. 50-34. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in a Special Flood Hazard Area; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; 
(7)  Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area; and 
(8)  Ensure that those who occupy a Special Flood Hazard Area assume responsibility for their actions.

    A Zone means portions of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) in which the principle source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A Zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of one hundred (100)-year flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined.

After restoration is complete these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure located on the same parcel of property as the principle structure, the use of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Accessory use means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
    Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall.

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    B and X Zones (shaded) means areas of the two-tenths (0.2) percent annual chance (five hundred (500) year) flood, areas subject to the one hundred (100) year flood with average depths of less than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage area less than one (1) square mile, and areas protected by levees from the base flood. 
    Base flood means a flood which has a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the one hundred (100) year flood). The term "base flood" is the term used throughout this division. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one (1) percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all four (4) sides. 
    Building means a walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground; including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facility or infrastructure. See Structure. 
    C and X (unshaded) Zones means areas determined to be outside the five hundred (500) year floodplain. 
    Community means a political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    Community rating system (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures for protection from flooding. 
    Community flood hazard area (CFHA) means an area that has been determined by the Floodplain Administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams. 
    Critical facility means any property that, if flooded, would result in severe consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the health and safety of the public. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials, hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
    D Zone means an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated structure means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, piling, columns (post and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls. (See freeboard requirements for residential and nonresidential structures.) 
    Elevation certificate means a statement certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor on the FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of certification that verifies a structure's elevation and other related information to verify compliance with this division. 
    Emergency program means the initial phase under which a community participates in the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Enclosure means that portion of a structure below the base flood elevation (BFE) used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the structure. 
    Encroachment means the physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. The term "existing construction" may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the City based on specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of special flood hazards.

(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (5) of this section. 
a.  In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. See section 50-55. 
b.  In an A Zone, where no technical data has been produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, as determined by this community. The Floodplain Administrator will determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods include, but are not limited to, detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgment in the event no data can be produced. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) chapter 4, regulation 060, section 5(6)a (401 KAR 4:060(5)6.a), states as a part of the technical requirements for a State Floodplain Permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries(and thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to Mean Sea Level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than five-tenths (0.5) foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations.

Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or 
2.  Have a minimum of two (2) openings with a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
(3)  Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; 
b.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; and 
d.  Electrical, plumbing and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air condition equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located in accordance with all applicable codes, requirements and specifications.

3.  Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
c.  Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that the manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above the highest adjacent grade. 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
3.  Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this article, including anchoring and elevation requirements for manufactured homes. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the State motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-52 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge.

DIVISION 7. - APPEALS AND VARIANCES 

Sec. 50-111. - Appeals and variance procedures. 
(a)  Nature of variances. The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this division would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. It is the duty of the City to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this division are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(b)  Designation of variance and appeals board. The Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this division. 
(c)  Duties of variance and appeals board. 
(1)  The Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the City in the enforcement or administration of this division. 
(2)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Commissioners or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the McCracken County Circuit Court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes. 
(d)  Appeals/variance considerations. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this division, and the: 
(1)  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
(4)  Importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility; 
(5)  Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of functionally dependent facility; 
(6)  Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges. 
(e)  Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this division, the Board of Commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this division. 
(1)  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard. The term "minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this division. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City need not grant permission for the applicant to build at-grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this division); and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in section 50-41 under the term "public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in section 50-41) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(5)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built, and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(6)  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request. 
(7)  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the provisions of subsection (d)(1) through (11) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
(f)  Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage. 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the McCracken County Court Clerk's Office and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(3)  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(g)  Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition, section 50-41) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(h)  No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

Additionally, a copy of the order, in the case of work for which there is an EPSC permit, shall be mailed by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to the address listed by the permittee on the permit. 
(c)  Once a stop work order has been issued, the permittee may not conduct land-disturbing activities until such time that the permittee has demonstrated full compliance with the approved EPSC plan, and received written approval by the Issuing Authority. 
(d)  For land disturbance activities being conducted without a permit, the responsible parties shall immediately cease such activity upon being notified by the Issuing Authority. If the responsible party does not cease the land disturbance activity immediately, the Issuing Authority may request the City Attorney to obtain injunctive relief. 
(e)  Ten (10) calendar days after posting a stop-work order, the Issuing Authority may issue a notice of intent to the permittee, landowner, or land user of the Issuing Authority's intent to perform work necessary to comply with this article. The Issuing Authority may go on the land and commence work after three (3) calendar days from issuing the notice of intent. The costs incurred by the Issuing Authority to perform this work shall be paid by the landowner or permittee out of the fiscal security referred to in this article, to the extent that the amount is covered thereby, with the remainder being directly due and owed by the landowner or permittee. In the event no EPSC permit was issued or no bond was posted, the cost, plus interest at the rate authorized by the Issuing Authority, plus a reasonable administrative and attorneys fee shall be billed to the owner. 
(f)  Compliance with the provisions of this article may also be enforced by injunction. 
(g)  The Issuing Authority is authorized to require immediate abatement of any violation of this article that constitutes an immediate threat to the health, safety or well-being of the public.

Any expense related to such remediation undertaken by the Issuing Authority shall be fully reimbursed by the property owner and/or responsible party. If any expenses related to remediation are not reimbursed by the property owner and/or responsible party within ten (10) days of notification by the Issuing Authority to these individuals, then the expenses shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. The Issuing Authority shall be entitled to recover from the property owner and/or responsible party all reasonable attorney fees and other costs of collection required in order to enforce the lien, if any, which secures the liability of the property owner and/or responsible party related to these remediation expenses. 
(h)  Any person, firm, corporation or agency acting as principal, agent, employee or otherwise, who fails to comply with the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $100.00 per day and not more than $500.00 per day, or by imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or both, for each separate offense.

The complaint must be filed within six (6) months after the alleged unlawful practice occurred. Upon such filing, the State Commission on Human Rights, or other applicable State or Federal agency will be delegated all functions, duties, and powers with respect to investigating, conciliating, hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting, or otherwise acting as to any work, business, or matter regarding such claim. 
(b)  An individual claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful practice relating to gender identity or sexual orientation may file with the Commission a written (sworn) complaint stating that an unlawful practice has been committed, setting forth the facts upon which the complaint is based, and setting forth the facts sufficient to enable the Commission to identify the person(s) charged (respondent(s)). The complaint must be filed within six (6) months after the alleged unlawful practice occurred. 
(1)  Upon filing of the complaint, the Commission, or its designated committee, shall, after notifying the City Manager's office, make a prompt and full investigation of each complaint. 
(2)  If it is determined that there is no probable cause to believe that the respondent is engaged in an unlawful practice, the Commission shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. 
(3)  If it is determined, after investigation, that there is probable cause to believe the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the Commission shall endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful practice by conference conciliation, and persuasion. The terms of the conciliation agreement reached with the respondent may require him to refrain from the Commission of unlawful discriminatory practices in the future and make such further provisions as may be agreed upon between the Commission and the respondent. Except for the terms of the conciliation agreement, neither the Commission nor any officer or employee thereof shall make public, without the written consent of the complainant and the respondent, information concerning efforts in a particular case to eliminate an unlawful practice by conference, conciliation, or persuasion, whether or not there is a determination of probable cause or a conciliation agreement.

The hearing shall be held not less than ten (10) days after the service of the statement of charges. The respondent shall have the right to file an answer, to appear at the hearing in person or be represented by an attorney, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. A determination of probable cause shall in no way create a presumption of a violation. 
(5)  If three fourths of the Commissioners attending a duly constituted hearing determine that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the Commission shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the unlawful practice. If the Commission fails to determine that the respondent has engaged in an unlawful practice, the Commission shall so state and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint. 
(6)  In connection with an investigation of a complaint filed under this subsection, the Commission or its designated representatives at any reasonable time may request access to the premises, records, and documents relevant to the complaint and the right to examine, photograph, and copy evidence, but all such evidence mot otherwise presented at a public hearing shall be of a confidential nature.

Sec. 66-111. - Purpose and general policy. 
    The Board of Commissioners finds that the crass commercial exploitation of explicit sexual conduct through the public exhibition of obscene films and the sale of obscene publications constitutes a debasement and distortion of a sensitive key relationship of human existence central to family life, community welfare and the development of human personality; that such exploitation is indecent and offensive to the senses and to public morals and interferes with the interest of the public in the quality of life and total community environment, the tone of commerce in the City, property values and the public safety; and that the continuation of such activities is detrimental to the best health, safety, convenience, good morals and general welfare of the City and of the residents, citizens, inhabitants and business thereof and is unlawful and may not be made the subject of a lawful license. Pursuant to KRS 82.082 , the Board of Commissioners hereby declares such activities to be public nuisances, and establishes procedures for the abatement thereof and for the assessment and collection of costs of abatement which may be incurred by the City incident to such abatement. This division shall apply to existing establishments which are presently engaged in the activities herein declared to be public nuisances. 
(Code 1968, § 19-150; Code 1996, § 132.15; Code 1997, § 66-111; Ord. No. 83-6-2388, 6-14-1983) 
Sec. 66-112. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Knowledge or knowledge of such nuisance means having knowledge of the contents and character of the patently offensive sexual conduct which appears in the obscene matter. 
    Matter means a motion picture film or a publication, or both. 
    Motion picture film means and includes: 
(1)  Film or plate negative; 
(2)  Film or plate positive; 
(3)  Film designed to be projected on a screen for exhibition; 
(4)  Films, glass slides or transparencies, either in negative or positive form, designed for exhibition by projection on a screen; 
(5)  Video tape or any other medium used to electronically reproduce images on a screen. 
    Obscene matter means matter, taken as a whole, the predominant appeal of which to the average person, applying contemporary standards, is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion; and is matter which, taken as a whole, goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters; and is matter which, taken as a whole, is utterly without redeeming social importance. 
(1)  The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the matter is judged with reference to average adults unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for clearly defined deviant sexual groups, in which case the predominant appeal of the matter shall be judged with reference to its intended recipient group. 
(2)  Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that matter is being commercially exploited by the defendant for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance. 
(3)  Nothing herein contained is intended to include or proscribe any matter which, when considered as a whole, and in the context in which it is used, possesses serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. 
    Place means and includes, but is not limited to, any building, structure or place, or any separate part or portion thereof, whether permanent or not, or the ground itself.

ARTICLE II. - PLAT PROCEDURES 

Sec. 102-31. - General enforcement for plat approval. 
    In considering the approval of a plat, the Commission shall observe and enforce the following requirements. 
(Code 1968, app. B, § 4; Code 1996, § 155.15; Code 1997, § 102-31) 
Sec. 102-32. - Design standards. 
(a)  Access; land unsuitable for subdivision. No land shall be subdivided unless adequate access to the land over improved streets or thoroughfares exists or will be provided by the subdivider, nor shall such land be subdivided if it is considered by the Commission to be unsuitable for such use by reason of inclusion in a floodplain, or improper drainage, objectionable earth and rock formation, topography or any other feature harmful to the health and safety of possible residents and the community as a whole. The Commission may require pre-engineering data that ensures that drainage, topography, rock formations and other objectionable features may be corrected by means that are technically feasible and do not do irreparable damage to the environment. 
(b)  Conformance to major street plan and comprehensive plan. All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the major street plan. Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of the major street plan, such part of such proposed public way shall be dedicated to public use by the subdivider in conformity with the major street plan. Due consideration shall also be given by the subdivider and owners of adjoining property for the provision of school sites, park sites, rights-of-way for public utility lines, sites for business centers, industrial locations, and other features as indicated on the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Street and alley location and arrangement. 
(1)  The street and alley layout shall conform to the major street plan, shall provide access to all lots and parcels of land within the subdivision, and shall provide for the unbroken alignment of continuing streets at intersections. 
(2)  Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce useable lots and streets of reasonable gradient; maximum and minimum grade shall be as specified herein. 
(3)  Proposed through streets shall be dedicated to the boundary line of the tract to be subdivided so as to provide for normal circulation of traffic within the vicinity. Cul-de-sacs shall be provided as specified herein. 
(4)  Wherever there exists a dedicated or platted portion of a street or alley adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the newly subdivided portion thereof shall be dedicated, but not to exceed half of the prescribed width as shown in the master street plan. 
(5)  Alleys shall be provided in all parts of the proposed subdivision which are designated as business, commercial or industrial zones by the zoning code in chapter 62. Except where justified by extreme conditions, alleys will not be approved in those parts of the proposed subdivision located in residential zones. 
(6)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial or higher classification street, the Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic and adequate esthetics. 
(7)  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway, as designated on the major street plan, the Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(d)  Minimum street and alley widths. 
(1)  Major streets shall have dedicated right-of-way widths not less than those indicated for such streets in the major street plan. 
(2)  Each cul-de-sac street shall terminate in a circular right-of-way with a minimum diameter of eighty (80) feet. Such a cul-de-sac shall not come closer than fifty (50) feet from the boundary of a subdivision if its continuation is not needed for access to adjoining property. 
(3)  Alley right-of-way shall have a width of not less than thirty (30) feet. 
(e)  Maximum and minimum grades. 
(1)  Major streets, collector arterials and higher classified streets, not greater than six (6) percent. 
(2)  Other streets and alleys, not greater than ten (10) percent. 
(3)  The minimum grade of any street and gutter shall not be less than one-half (1/2) percent. 
(f)  Vertical curves. 
(1)  Major streets, minimum sight distance of six hundred (600) feet, measured between points four and one-half (4 1/2) feet above the center line of the roadway. 
(2)  Other streets, minimum sight distance of three hundred (300) feet, measured between points four and one-half (4 1/2) feet above the center line of the roadway. 
(g)  Minimum radii of curvature on center lines. Where a deflection angle of more than five degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve shall be introduced, providing for: 
(1)  Major streets, collector, arterial and higher classified streets, a minimum radius of five hundred (500) feet, but should be much greater whenever possible. 
(2)  Other streets, a minimum radius of two hundred (200) feet, but should be much greater wherever possible. 
(h)  Tangents. Between reversed curves there shall be not less than a minimum tangent for: 
(1)  Major streets (collector, arterial and higher classified streets), of two hundred (200) feet. 
(2)  Other streets, of one hundred (100) feet. 
(i)  Intersections. 
(1)  At street intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by an arc at least twenty (20) feet in radius or the chord of an arc fifteen (15) feet in radius. 
(2)  At alley intersections, property line corners shall be rounded by an arc at least fifteen (15) feet in radius or the chord of an arc ten (10) feet in radius. 
(3)  Due to safety considerations, all streets intersecting shall do so as near right angles, ninety (90) degrees, as practical, and the angle of intersections shall never vary over fifteen (15) degrees from a right angle. 
(4)  When a minor street intersects any street (another minor street included), it is desirable that four-leg intersections be avoided. The recommended minimum offset distance between the center lines of streets entering the opposite sides of a street shall be two hundred (200) feet. 
(j)  Blocks. 
(1)  The minimum width of blocks shall be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers of lots as described in subsections (k)(1) and (2) of this section, except as described in subsection (c)(6) of this section. 
(2)  Blocks shall not exceed one thousand, three hundred twenty (1,320) feet in length. 
(3)  The length of cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet. 
(k)  Lots. 
(1)  In any subdivision or part of a subdivision proposed, the minimum width and area for lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning chapter, but in no case shall the width at the building line be less than fifty (50) feet and the area contains less than six thousand (6,000) square feet, except where planned unit development (PUD) or where townhouse development is approved or upon curved street sections such as cul-de-sacs where they may abut the street for less than fifty (50) feet, provided they shall have readily apparent physical means of pedestrian and vehicle access from the lot onto the street. 
(2)  Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided, with the proportion of two (2) to one (1) normally being considered as a desirable maximum for lot widths of fifty (50) feet or greater. Pointed or very irregular shaped lots shall be avoided where possible. Additional depth may be required on lots which back up to railroads, major streets, rugged topography or other conflicting land uses. 
(3)  Building setback lines shall be established back of highway and street right-of-way lines, to the extent prescribed for front yard requirements in the zoning chapter, and shall be at least half the width of the dedicated right-of-way. 
(4)  Whenever possible, side lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to street lines. 
(5)  Every lot shall abut on a dedicated street, unless appropriate permanent access is provided by contract, easements or some other means acceptable to the Commission. 
(6)  Through lots having frontage on two (2) parallel or approximately parallel streets will be permitted only at the discretion of the Commission. 
(7)  Reversed frontage with reversed access should be avoided in blocks exclusively residential except under PUD. 
(8)  Except where alleys are provided for the purpose, each lot shall have an easement for utility lines along the rear lot line and along the side lot line where necessary. No easement shall be less than seven and one-half (7 1/2) feet wide on each lot, making an overall easement width of fifteen (15) feet. All above ground utilities shall be on back or side property lines where possible. 
(9)  When the terrain so requires, easements for sanitary sewers along lot lines other than the rear lot lines shall be provided. Drainage easements shall be shown as determined by the City Engineer. 
(Code 1968, app. B, § 4; Code 1996, § 155.16; Code 1997, § 102-32; Ord. No. 82-7-2267, 7-13-1982; Ord. No. 2004-2-6768, § 1, 2-24-2004) 
Sec. 102-33. - Required improvements. 
(a)  Monuments and markers. 
(1)  The subdivider shall install monuments of concrete cast in place with a diameter of not less than six (6) inches and a length of twenty-four (24) inches, or of precast concrete or durable stone not less than four (4) inches square and a length of thirty (30) inches, with a copper, brass or lead dowel, one-half (1/2) inch in diameter, at least two (2) inches in length, imbedded so that the top of the dowel shall be not more than one-fourth (1/4) inch above the surface and at the center of the monument. Should these metals not be available, a substitute metal shall be specified by the Commission. 
(2)  Monuments shall be set so that the top is level with the established grade adjoining it and placed so that the marked point on the metal center shall coincide exactly with the intersection of street and alley property lines, and with the beginning and ending of angles in the boundary line, and with the beginning and ending of all curves along streets on both the outside and the inside street lines, and with the intersection of lot lines with such curves. 
(3)  Lot corners not marked by concrete monuments as required above shall be marked by galvanized or wrought iron pipe, or iron or steel bars at least thirty (30) inches in length and not less than one-half (1/2) inch in diameter, the top of the pipe or bar to be set level with the established grade of the ground adjoining it. 
(b)  Streets and alleys. Streets, roads and alleys shall be constructed in accordance with standards set forth by the City Engineer. 
(1)  The subdivider shall grade all streets, roads and alleys to their full widths as shown on plans, profiles and cross sections prepared by the subdivider and approved by the City Engineer. The minimum roadway pavement widths for streets as measured between curbs and gutters are shown in Table I as follows: 
TABLE I 
Type Street Minimum Pavement Width 
Between Curbs 
Gutters(feet) Collector streets (60 foot ROW) 37 Minor Commercial Developments (50 foot ROW) 27 Residential streets (40 foot ROW) 22  
(2)  The streets shall be surfaced by the subdivider to the dimensions described in Table I above. However, such surfacing need not exceed thirty (30) feet in width in single-family residential developments. The surfacing shall be placed within the prescribed rights-of-way so as to conform to the cross sections prescribed for the streets as required by the City Engineer. 
(3)  In all other zoning districts, the subdivider shall meet the requirements for width of pavement as stated in Table 1. The recommended pavement thickness shall be in conformance with the current American Association of State Highway Officials standards and the pavement design reviewed and approved by the City Engineer. 
(4)  The type of surface required of the subdivider for residential development subject to the approval by the City Engineer shall be one (1) of the following alternates: 
a.  Eight (8) inches of dense graded aggregate base, to be constructed in two (2) four (4) inch courses, or six (6) inches of bank gravel along with four (4) inches of dense graded aggregate for the surface course, or another base material approved by the City Engineer, plus three (3) inches of bituminous asphalt material (two inches Class I binder, one (1) inch Class I surface course conforming to Kentucky Department of Highways specifications). 
b.  A single course of Portland cement concrete having either: 
1.  A uniform slab thickness of seven (7) inches bar and mesh reinforced pavement; or 
2.  A mesh reinforced thickened edge slab having a minimum thickness of six (6) inches; nine (9) inches at the construction joint and seven (7) inches at each edge. 
c.  In case a single-family residential subdivision includes streets identified as collector or above in the major street plan, the City may join with the subdivider in the building of such streets. The extent of the City's participation in building such streets shall be limited exclusively to the additional cost resulting from the installation of street surface exceeding thirty (30) feet in width, or the additional cost resulting from the installation of a heavier and stronger pavement surface than selected by the subdivider, or the additional costs resulting from both these conditions. 
(5)  The alleys shall be surfaced to a width of twenty (20) feet, such surfacing to be at least equal to one (1) of the following: 
a.  Eight (8) inches of dense graded aggregate base, and one and one-half (1 1/2) inches Class I bituminous surface. 
b.  A single course of Portland cement concrete having a uniform slab thickness of six (6) inches. 
c.  Approved by the City Engineer. 
(c)  Curbs and gutters. The subdivider shall provide curbs and gutters for all streets in the subdivision. Curbs and gutters shall be placed in accordance with the paved width prescribed for the street in the major street plan. Curb and gutter construction shall be in accordance with city engineering standards. 
(d)  Sidewalks. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with concrete sidewalks at least five feet wide and five inches thick on each side of the street included within the plat. Such sidewalks shall be within the street right-of-way and shall abut the property lines. Sidewalk construction shall be in accordance with City engineering standards. 
(e)  Sewers. 
(1)  The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a complete sanitary sewer system acceptable to the State and local health officials and to the Commission. The City will reimburse the subdivider for the cost of the system by collections of sewer tap fees on the individual lots within the subdivision. Free and clear title to the system shall pass to the City upon the first tap-on reimbursement to the development. The balance is to be paid as each tap-on is made. Said balance shall carry no interest. The cost of the system shall be established by the contract amount resulting from competitive bidding with payments verified by a licensed engineer. 
(2)  When a sanitary sewer collection system is to be installed, the City may require sewers of a size larger than needed to service the area watershed. In such cases the subdivider shall cooperate with the City in the design of the sewer system, and the City shall be responsible for the immediate payment of the additional cost of installing the larger sewer. 
(3)  The plans and specifications for the installation of a sanitary sewer system shall be prepared by the subdivider in accordance with Kentucky Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection and city engineering standards and approved by the City Engineer, as well as the Kentucky Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. The City Engineer shall receive one (1) set of the plans and specifications as approved, and the City shall inspect and approve the installation of the sanitary sewer system installation. The plans and specifications for such system as built shall be filed with the Commission. Linen or Mylar tracings shall be furnished to the City Engineer. 
(4)  In the absence of an available sewer system, the subdivider may propose to construct a subsurface lateral field sewage disposal system. Minimum lot area requirements for single-family dwelling units shall be one (1) acre per unit. All multifamily dwelling units shall require at least one-half (1/2) acre per unit. Commercial lateral disposal systems shall be in accordance with the requirements established by the McCracken County Health Department. 
(f)  Water. A complete water distribution system shall be provided by the subdivider, developer or property owner in accordance with Paducah waterworks rules and regulations. 
(g)  Storm drainage. 
(1)  The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with an adequate stormwater sewer system, in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by the subdivider and approved by the City Engineer. The Commission, with the approval of the Board of Commissioners, may vary the requirements for storm sewer improvements under extreme conditions. 
(2)  Since curbs and gutters are to be provided, surface inlets will be required at appropriate intervals along the street surface to remove stormwater. Valley gutters crossing the street surface will not be permitted. In addition, easements for existing and future surface drainage may be required to handle stormwater runoff not included in the street system. 
(3)  When a stormwater drainage system is to be installed, the City may require improvements of a size larger than needed to service the area watershed. In such cases the City shall be responsible for the payment of the additional cost of installing the larger improvements. As-built linen or Mylar tracings shall be furnished to the City Engineer. 
(h)  Conformance with standard design. All installations of improvements required by this section shall conform to such applicable standard designs and specifications as have been adopted by the appropriate utility companies and City Engineer and approved by the Commission and are effective at the time of such installations.

Sec. 102-34. - Variances and modification of standards; fees for connecting to sanitary sewer. 
(a)  Where the subdivider can show that a provision of section 102-32(e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k)(2) or (k)(3) or section 102-33(c) or (d) would cause extreme hardship if strictly adhered to, and where, in the opinion of the Commission, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, a departure may be made without destroying the intent of such provision, the Commission may authorize a variance. The suffering of financial hardship, standing alone, will not be grounds for granting a variance. Any variance thus authorized shall be entered in writing in the minutes of the Commission and the reasoning on which the departure was justified shall be set forth. 
(b)  The requirements and principles of land subdivision, as set forth herein, may be modified by the Commission in the case of a subdivision large enough to be developed as a PUD as described in the zoning chapter, in accordance with a plan prepared by the subdivider and adopted as part of the comprehensive plan; provided, however, that such modification shall not extend to the provisions hereof requiring conformance with standard designs and specifications, as set forth in section 102-33(h). 
(c)  In the case of a plat constituting the replat of land into two (2) or more lots, all of which will be served by an existing street or streets, the Commission shall have the power to vary the said requirements and procedures so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. 
(d)  Fees for connecting to a sanitary sewer for which a fee has been established shall be the amount established for a single connection or service times the following factors: 
(1)  For single-family residential buildings, including those wherein a home occupation may exist, and churches, the factor shall be one (1). 
(2)  For all other residential, business or industrial uses, the factor shall be the greater of: 
a.  The number of lots, or fractions thereof, within the actual or required building or plant site as subdivided at the time the fee was established; 
b.  The number of lots in said site as subdivided at the time of connection, if the property was not subdivided at the time the fee was established; or 
c.  One fee for the nearest one hundred (100) feet of front footage on a street where lots face in a subdivided area, or along a street where a connection may be made in unsubdivided areas; provided, however, there shall be at least one (1) connection fee per connection regardless of lot size, and further provided that the factor for determining a maximum fee shall be established by dividing the front footage by fifty (50) feet. 
(Code 1968, app. B, § 6; Code 1996, § 155.18; Code 1997, § 102-34)

(1)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply to all digital submittals unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meeting: 
    CAD or CADD means computer-aided design and drafting. CAD systems are used to create maps and plans and are closely related to GIS systems. Although most CAD systems lack certain features essential to GIS analysis, such as the power to manage different spatial coordinate systems and database capabilities, many CAD systems have been developed into full GIS with the addition of necessary functions. 
    City means the City of Paducah, Kentucky, (37° 5'2" N 88° 35'49" W). 
    Coordinate System means a reference framework consisting of a set of points, lines, and/or surfaces, and a set of rules, used to define the positions of points in space in either two (2) or three (3) dimensions. The Cartesian coordinate system and the geographic coordinate system used on the earth's surface are common examples of coordinate systems. 
    DGN (design) means the name used for CAD file formats supported by Bentley Systems' MicroStation and Intergraph's Interactive Graphics Design System (IGDS) CAD programs. 
    DWG (drawing) means a format used for storing two (2) and three (3) dimensional design data and metadata. It is the native format for several CAD packages including AutoCAD, Intellicad, and PowerCAD. 
    DXF means an abbreviation for drawing interchange format, a file exchange format developed by Autodesk Inc. for its AutoCAD drafting software. DXF files are ASCII records of all objects in a drawing file. DXF has been adopted more recently by GIS systems for exchanging map files. 
    Geographic coordinate system means a reference system that uses latitude and longitude to define the locations of points on the surface of a sphere or spheroid. A geographic coordinate system definition includes a datum, prime meridian, and angular unit. 
    Geographic information system (GIS) means a geographic information system (GIS) integrates hardware, software, and data for capturing, managing, analyzing, and displaying all forms of geographically referenced information. 
    Georeferencing means aligning geographic data to a known coordinate system so it can be viewed, queried, and analyzed with other geographic data. Georeferencing may involve shifting, rotating, scaling, skewing, and in some cases warping, rubber sheeting, or orthorectifying the data. 
    Licensed professional means Professional Engineer or Surveyor registered in the state. 
    MAP-GIS Consortium means a partnership among local government agencies to establish a countywide Geographic Information System. The six (6) partners are the City of Paducah, McCracken County, E-911, Joint Sewer Agency, Paducah Power and Paducah Water. 
    NAD 27 means North American Horizontal Datum 1927. 
    NAD 83 means North American Horizontal Datum 1983. 
    NGS; National Geodetic Survey means the National Geodetic Survey and the Office of Coast Survey are the two (2) successor agencies in the United States to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. It was first established by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 as the Survey of the Coast. 
    Shapefile (ESRI software) means a vector data storage format for storing the location, shape, and attributes of geographic features. A shapefile is stored in a set of related files and contains one (1) feature class. 
    State plane coordinate system means a group of planar coordinate systems based on the division of the United States into more than 130 zones to minimize distortion caused by map projections. Each zone has its own map projection and parameters and uses either the NAD 27 or NAD 83 horizontal datum. The Lambert conformal conic projection is used for states that extend mostly east-west, while transverse Mercator is used for those that extend mostly north-south. The oblique Mercator projection is used for the panhandle of Alaska. 
(2)  Maps and/or plats submitted to the City that conform to this requirement shall be submitted to the Department of Planning in digital format by a licensed professional in accordance with the following detail: 
a.  Format requirements . The formats for digital submission of subdivision or improvement plans and plats shall be Shapefile (*.SHP), AutoCAD (*.DWG), MicroStation (*.DGN), or Export file (*.DXF). The digital file for the final document shall be submitted to:

Submittals to the City's Department of Planning will be retained by the City and will not be returned to the preparer or owner. 
e.  In order to maintain the mathematical integrity of the geometric data, all submittals shall comply with the following requirements: 
1.  Boundaries will be transmitted as a closed figure and shall be shown as one (1) continuous line rather than a series of lines, arcs, and curves; 
2.  Annotation submitted digitally shall be identical to annotation submitted on the hardcopy maps; and 
3.  When displaying coordinates, the whole number for the coordinate must be shown (i.e. no constants will be applied). 
f.  Georeferencing. 
1.  All maps and/or plats submitted to the City must be georeferenced to the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System, South Zone (1602), NAD 83 in US survey feet, or latest revision or adjustment used by MAP-GIS. The locations will be on opposite sides of the subdivision boundary or as previously agreed upon by MAP-GIS; 
2.  The basis of bearings for the plat shall be the Kentucky State Plane Coordinate System, South Zone (1602), NAD 83, in US survey feet. These must be established by the use of existing monuments, global positioning system surveys, or by astronomic observations; and

Sec. 108-31. - Transfer of the licenses. 
(a)  Any license issued hereunder shall not be assigned, transferred, sold, or disposed of, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, or by force or involuntary sale, without prior consent of the City on proper application, and then on only such conditions as may be prescribed to guarantee the continued performance of the licensee or to otherwise protect the public interest in telecommunications facilities and services. The City is hereby empowered to take legal or equitable action to set aside, annul, revoke or cancel the license, or the transfer of the license, if said transfer is not made according to the procedures established hereby. This provision shall apply equally to any change in the ownership of the licensee's parent corporation, if any, or its successor in interest, or any other transfer of control, de jure or de facto. 
(b)  Any proposed transfer or assignment shall only be made by a written document, copies of which shall be filed with the City Clerk at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date of the transfer or assignment, accompanied by a check for the transfer processing fee.

If such a hearing is called by the Mayor and Board of Commissioners, the City Manager shall submit the City Manager's recommendation not less than ten (10) days in advance thereof. In the absence of any such hearing the Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall act on the application within thirty (30) days of the date the application is deemed complete. 
(c)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the licensee from assigning, mortgaging, or pledging its interest or equity in the wire telecommunications system authorized by this license or any part thereof, for purposes of financing, except that in any case the licensee shall not assign, encumber, or pledge its interest or equity in the system or any part thereof for any purpose other than financing improvements or extensions to the system authorized by this license, or a general pledge of all the assets of its parent, if any, or those of its successors in interest, to provide major funding of the parent. 
(d)  For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer, the City or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of the prospective transferee and such other matters as the City may deem necessary to determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be approved, denied, or conditioned. The licensee and any prospective transferees shall assist the City in any such inquiry, and if they fail to do so, the request for transfer may be denied. 
(e)  Any transfer without the City's prior written approval shall be ineffective, and shall make the license subject to cancellation at the City's sole discretion, and to any other remedies available under the license or other applicable law. Any such cancellation may be by resolution of the City Mayor and Board of Commissioners and shall not be subject to the requirements of section 52-39 (revocation and termination). No act or omission by the City shall be construed as expressing approval of or acquiescence in such a transfer in the absence of the City's express written approval. 
(f)  As a condition of considering a transfer, the City may require that the transferor or the transferee pay the City's out-of-pocket expenses and a reasonable fee in considering the application for transfer of a license. The transferor and transferee shall agree that any payments made to the City are not a franchise fee and fall within one (1) or more of the exceptions in 47 USC 542(g)(2), and that no such payments may be passed through to subscribers in any form. 
(g)  For purposes of this section, the term "parent" means any entity that directly or indirectly, whether immediately or through any number of intermediaries, owns or controls any interest in the licensee, except that an entity owning less than one (1) percent of the stock in a publicly traded corporation shall not be considered a parent unless it exercises actual control over a licensee. 
(h)  For purposes of this section, the term "control" means the legal or practical ability to exert actual working control over the affairs of a licensee or parent, either directly or indirectly, whether by contractual agreement, majority ownership interest, or any lesser ownership interest, or in any other manner. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation of five (5) percent or more of the ownership of the licensee or a parent by any person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own or control fifty (50) percent or more of such right or control, singly or collectively.

Prior to the utilization of any street for the placement of the transmission plant of the wire telecommunications system, the licensee shall secure and place on file with the City Clerk a utility pole usage agreement with each utility within the City currently owning such poles, conduits, and other facilities that are to be used by the licensee. To the extent that existing poles, posts, conduits, and other such structures or replacements therefor are not available or will not be available to the licensee within a reasonable time, the licensee may purchase, lease, or in any manner acquire land or rights-of-way upon or under which to erect and maintain its own poles, conduits, and other such structures. Any license hereunder is subject to existing and future statutes and ordinances requiring the placement of a utility plant underground. 
(c)  All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment erected by the licensee within the City shall be so located as to cause the minimum interference with the proper use of streets and to cause the minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin the said streets. 
(d)  In case of disturbance of any street or paved area the licensee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City Engineer replace and restore such street and/or paved area to as good condition as before the work involving the disturbance was done. If such restoration or replacement is not completed within thirty (30) days of the date of excavation, or if the completed work is found by the City Engineer to be unsatisfactory, the City may repair or replace the inadequate work or complete the unfinished work and bill the licensee for the cost of such work, including at least labor, equipment, materials, supervision, and overhead. 
(e)  If at any time during the period of the license the City shall elect to alter or change the grade of any street, or construct any other public works, where the cables or other facilities of the licensee are located, the licensee, upon reasonable notice by the City Engineer, City Public Works Street Department or the City Communications Officer, shall remove, relay, and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, and other fixtures at its own expense, and at no expense to the City.

(i)  The licensee shall be responsible for obtaining at its expense all necessary permits for stringing, pulling, or otherwise installing communications cables, carrier wires, wires or guys within the City, including erection of poles, the making of cuts in the pavement of the streets or sidewalks within the City, and trenching in public rights-of-way. The licensee shall participate in the "BUD" (before you dig) or an equivalent program in the State to the extent available and applicable. The licensee shall promptly mark its underground lines and facilities upon reasonable request of the City or other authorized occupants of municipal rights-of-way, and shall request, upon reasonable notice before digging, the marking of other occupants' underground lines and facilities. 
(j)  To minimize unnecessary exhaustion of utility space under or over public streets by build-outs of wire telecommunications systems; to reduce unnecessary wear-and-tear on, and disruption of, the pavement of public streets and sidewalks by such systems; and to enhance the utility of telecommunications services available to businesses and persons resident in the City, licensees under this article may be required by the City's Communications Officer, insofar as is economically reasonable and technically feasible, to interconnect their respective systems with other local wire telecommunications systems and with local cable television systems by a date certain. Interconnection of services provided for in section 108-36 (required services), may be required by the administrators of the respective educational and governmental services. The requirements of this subsection constitute a continuing obligation of each licensee during the term of the license; provided, however, that this subsection requiring interconnection shall not apply to wire telecommunications systems only transmitting in McCracken County; but all wire telecommunications systems shall be subject to subsection (b) of this section and section 108-39 (technical standards). 
(k)  The cost of such interconnection shall be equitably apportioned between or among the systems being interconnected. If the licensee and cable grantee, as the case may be, cannot agree on the division of costs, the system seeking to build out may be required to bond the full costs of interconnection or that portion thereof that the City finds fair and reasonable, subject to the outcome of arbitration or other resolution of the disagreement over apportionment by the City Manager's office, and the interconnection shall be effectuated by the date certain without waiting for the final apportionment of costs. 
(l)  The local exchange carrier (LEC) (i.e., the local telephone company) providing existing local switched telephone service in the City must immediately begin efforts to allow full access to all local switched telephone services upon final adoption by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of a set of rules and regulations governing competitive access providers entry into the local telephone services market. Further the LEC must also, upon approval by the FCC, unbundle and make available network elements, upon request to all would be competitors for resale. These network elements may include, but not be limited to, network interface devices, local loops, local and tandem switches, including all software feature provided by switches, interoffice transmission facilities, signaling and call related database facilities, operations support system and operator and directory assistance facilities. The prices for these services must be cost-based, and if not set by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) in a timely manner to meet the open competition requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the telecommunications cost prices will be set by the City.

(Code 1997, § 108-37; Ord. No. 98-3-5828, § 12, 3-10-1998) 
Sec. 108-38. - Performance evaluations. 
(a)  The Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall have the right under this article at any time to review the performance of the licensee and to ascertain that all provisions of the license are being fully and faithfully carried out. The Mayor and Board of Commissioners may utilize the City Communications Officer in the performance evaluation process. 
(b)  At least ninety (90) days before conducting a performance evaluation, the City Communications Officer shall prepare a report, containing its findings concerning the licensee's performance of all provisions of the license. Said report shall be submitted to the Mayor and Board of Commissioners not less than thirty (30) days before the scheduled performance evaluation, and a copy shall be provided to the licensee. 
(c)  The performance evaluation may, and upon request of the licensee shall, include a public hearing at which the report described in subsection (b) of this section shall be presented, and the significant findings therein shall be read, and at which any citizen may appear to present evidence or opinions regarding the licensee's performance, facilities, or services. The Mayor and Board of Commissioners further may receive any other evidence, reports, documents, or testimony from any person, bearing on the licensee's performance, and may employ a consultant to conduct any investigation or to make recommendations concerning the licensee's performance. The licensee shall be afforded a full opportunity to respond to all such reports, citizens' comments, and consultants' findings. The licensee shall promptly make available to the Mayor and Board of Commissioners and the City Communications Officer, or to consultants retained by the Mayor and Board of Commissioners, any records, documents, or other information as the Mayor and Board of Commissioners may request. 
(d)  Upon written notification from the City Communications Officer, the licensee shall notify its subscribers of the time, place, and purposes of the performance evaluation by mail no later than fifteen (15) days immediately preceding the scheduled performance evaluation. 
(e)  Following each performance evaluation, the Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall adopt by resolution its findings, if any. The Mayor and Board of Commissioners further may order any changes in the licensee's operations that the Mayor and Board of Commissioners finds to be reasonable and necessary to comply with the terms of the license. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness, necessity, and cost of any such change. Once the Mayor and Board of Commissioners has ordered such change, the licensee shall be given a reasonable period of time in which to make any installation or construction that may be required. No change shall be ordered by the Mayor and Board of Commissioners where the authority to do so has been and continues to be preempted by the FCC or the Kentucky Public Service (PSC) or other agency of competent jurisdiction and authority, or where a court of competent jurisdiction has found that the Mayor and Board of Commissioners has no such authority. 
(f)  All records and minutes of each performance evaluation shall be retained by the City Clerk and be available for inspection throughout the remaining term of the license. The City Clerk shall forward a copy of the minutes of the performance evaluation to the licensee. 
(g)  Upon application of the licensee to the Mayor and Board of Commissioners prior to expiration of this license, the licensee may seek a new license to permit continued operation of its wired telecommunications system, and the Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall determine whether it is in the public interest to consider the issuance of a new license to replace the licensee's existing license upon its expiration; and if such determination is affirmative, the City Manager and the licensee shall initiate the necessary negotiations. Nothing herein shall require the Mayor and Board of Commissioners to award an extension or renewal of the license, nor prevent consideration of the same after the date specified herein. The licensee may continue operation under the terms of its existing license while it is actively prosecuting its application for a succeeding license. 
(Code 1997, § 108-38; Ord. No. 98-3-5828, § 13, 3-10-1998) 
Sec. 108-39. - System technical standards. 
(a)  The licensee shall construct and maintain the wire telecommunications system according to the technical standards established by regulation or rule of the FCC, as stated in FCC Rules and Regulations, as now exist or may hereinafter be amended. 
(b)  All wire telecommunications systems of licensees, insofar as financially and technically feasible, shall be compatible one with another and with similar systems adjacent to the City. Services and facilities provided under section 108-36 (required services) of this article shall be inter-operable. 
(Code 1997, § 108-39; Ord. No. 98-3-5828, § 14, 3-10-1998) 
Sec. 108-40. - Rates and charges for services. 
(a)  The City shall have the right under this article to regulate the rates charged by the licensee for transmission services provided by and through the system, except where such rates are otherwise subject to real and effective competition or regulation by a Federal or State authority of competent and legal jurisdiction. 
(b)  The licensee may, at its option, reduce rates for any services, or waive said rates temporarily (but for not more than thirty (30) days for any user), for promotional purposes, but not in such fashion as to discriminate unduly against other users. Nothing herein shall prevent the licensee from reducing its rates for any service for all subscribers. 
(Code 1997, § 108-40; Ord. No. 98-3-5828, § 15, 3-10-1998) 
Sec. 108-41. - License fees. 
(a)  In consideration of the grant of a license to use the public rights-of-way under this article, the licensee may be required to pay a wired telecommunications system license fee to the City annually. The City reserves the right to assess and establish an annual competitively neutral and non-discriminatory rights-of-way and license fee at a later date. The amount of the fee shall be assessed and established by the Mayor and Board of Commissioners in the form of an amendment to this article. 
(b)  The licensee shall cooperate with the City in filing any applications that may be necessary to obtain approval of the license fee provided for herein, and the licensee shall affirmatively support the granting of any approval required. 
(c)  The licensee shall include in gross revenues subject to the percentage fee specified in subsection (a) of this section all revenues for or in connection with telecommunications services and facilities provided for hire in the City. The licensee's revenues derived film transmissions to or from points within the City from or to points outside the City, respectively, or transiting, the City shall be fairly and consistently apportioned. As to the licensee's revenues subject to the State sales tax, a consistent revenue base shall be used in computing that portion of the fee due under subsection (a) of this section. The licensee and the City may from time to time agree on alternative systems of apportionment and/or estimation. Where revenues are derived from services procured from another licensee under this article, the licensed reselling provider shall provide a resale certificate to the licensed underlying provider certifying that an equal or greater license fee has been or will be paid to the City with respect to the services resold by the licensed reselling provider. Upon submission of such certificate to the City, those revenues shall be excluded from the revenues of the underlying provider, as computed for the purpose of this section, to the extent necessary to avoid the collection of multiple license fees based on the same revenues. 
(d)  It is intended that the license fee will promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and taxpayers of the community in part by providing funding for city and associated entities in the development and operation of telecommunication and information systems and services and to allow and provide for the necessary regulation of a licensee's activities and its use of the streets, public ways, right-of-way, and easements. The City reserves the right to designate the use of the rights-of-way and license fee at a later date. The designation of the use of these fees shall be made by the Mayor and Board of Commissioners in the form of an amendment to this article. 
(e)  The arms-length revenue-equivalent for telecommunications services provided to nonlicensee affiliates of the licensee shall be included in the computation of revenue base for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section. The licensee shall submit with each quarterly payment schedules showing the basis and effect of computations pursuant to this subsection and section 108-43 (fee coordination). 
(f)  The payment due to the City in accordance with subsection (a) of this section shall be completed and paid quarterly, based on the licensee's fiscal year. The licensee shall file with the City, within thirty (30) days after the close of each of the licensee's fiscal quarters, a statement showing the gross revenues received by the licensee during the immediately preceding quarter, and the amount of the license fee now due. The payment of the license fee shall be made at the time such statement is submitted. A copy of the licensee's income statement for the entire year, audited by an independent Certified Public Accountant, shall accompany the fourth quarter payment for each year. If revenues are received from affiliates and subsidiaries, audited income statements thereof shall also accompany the fourth payment for each year. In addition to other remedies under this article or the license, the City may charge interest on delinquent payments at the rate established in the State for delinquent tax payments at the time. 
(g)  The City shall have the right to inspect the licensee's financial records and those of licensee's subsidiaries and affiliates from which revenue was earned, the right of audit, and the right to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this license; provided, however, that such audit shall take place within thirty-six (36) months following the close of each of the licensee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due as a result of such audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the licensee by the City, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. The cost of such audit shall be borne by the licensee if it is determined that the licensee's annual payment to the City for the preceding year is increased thereby by more than five (5) percent; otherwise, the cost shall be borne by the City. 
(h)  No acceptance of any payment by the City shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable as a license fee for the performance of any obligation of the licensee or as evidence of the City's acceptance of or acquiescence to any act or omission of the grantee. 
(i)  In lieu of payments to the City pursuant to section 108-36(f) (required services) shall also be made on a quarterly basis unless otherwise provided by the City Mayor and Board of Commissioners. 
(Code 1997, § 108-41; Ord. No. 98-3-5828, § 16, 3-10-1998) 
Sec. 108-42. - Method of accounting. 
    The licensee shall maintain complete and accurate records of its accounts, in accordance with the standard and accepted accounting methods applicable to the competitive telecommunications industry, as recommended by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and in compliance with the rules and regulations of any Federal or State regulatory agency having jurisdiction over licensee. 
(Code 1997, § 108-42; Ord. No. 98-3-5828, § 17, 3-10-1998) 
Sec. 108-43. - Fee coordination with existing and future franchises. 
(a)  There shall be credited against the license fee prescribed in section 108-41 (license fees) for a wire telecommunications system any amount received by the City as a franchise or license fee as such from the operator of any cable television system that is transported on such wire telecommunications system during that period, to the extent necessary to avoid the collection of duplicating franchise and licensee fees based on the same revenues. 
(b)  Revenues received under tariffs for local telephone exchange service by a telecommunications common carrier under an existing franchise or right-of-way agreement heretofore adopted by the City shall be excluded from the licensee's gross revenues for the purposes of section 108-41(a) (license fees). This exclusion applies only to the term of the local telephone franchise or agreement during which this article was originally adopted; it does not apply to any extension of the term of the franchise or agreement or to any renewal of such franchise or agreement.

Sec. 108-45. - Liability and indemnification. 
(a)  The licensee shall indemnify and hold the City harmless from any and all loss sustained by the City on account of any suit, judgment, execution, claim, or demand whatsoever against the City resulting from the licensee's construction, operation, or maintenance of the wire telecommunications system. 
(b)  By its acceptance of its license, the licensee specifically agrees that it will pay all expenses and costs incurred by the City in defending itself with regard to all damages and penalties described in this section (liability and indemnification).

Sec. 108-46. - Revocation and termination of a license; acquisition of a wire telecommunications system. 
(a)  The Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall have the right to revoke and terminate or to foreshorten any license issued under this article for any of the following causes: 
(1)  If the licensee is not, or does not continue to be, a qualified licensee as defined in section 108-29(c) (granting clause), and the defect is not remedied within a reasonable time after due notice is given by the City. 
(2)  If the licensee has committed a series of major violations of this license, as defined in section 108-51(a) (penalties), such as to indicate that the licensee is unable or unwilling to comply with its license, and the licensee has failed to correct or desist from the violations within a reasonable time after due notice has been given by the City. 
(3)  If the licensee files in any court a petition of voluntary bankruptcy, or is involuntarily adjudged bankrupt in any court of competent jurisdiction, or if the licensee's title and interest in the cable system authorized by this license or the license itself is taken by execution in any court of competent jurisdiction, or is forfeited or subject to forfeiture before any court, or is placed in receivership or trusteeship. 
(b)  If at any time the City Manager has reason to believe that the licensee is in jeopardy of having its license revoked and terminated for any reason, other than by reason of a transfer without approval under section 108-31 (transfers), the City shall so notify the licensee in writing, and order the licensee to show cause before the Mayor and Board of Commissioners within thirty (30) days why such revocation or termination should not take place. If the licensee fails to show cause, or in any case if the Mayor and Board of Commissioners finds that any of the causes listed in subsection (a) of this section pertain that adequate notice has previously been given, and that the licensee has failed to correct the defects or violations as required, the Mayor and Board of Commissioners may declare the license to be revoked and terminated, and may proceed to acquire the wire television system as provided in section subsection (d) of this section. 
(c)  In any case if the license is voluntarily surrendered by the licensee, the Mayor and Board of Commissioners may at its option proceed with the acquisition of the wire telecommunications system as provided in subsection (d) of this section.

(2)  Within thirty (30) days after such notice, the Mayor and Board of Commissioners and the licensee each shall appoint a qualified and experienced wire telecommunications property appraiser, and they together shall appoint a third appraiser mutually acceptable to them. If the Mayor and Board of Commissioner's appraiser and the licensee's appraiser are unable to agree on the appointment of a third appraiser, either party may ask the American Arbitration Association to appoint the third appraiser. 
(3)  The appraisers thus appointed shall determine the net asset value or depreciated original cost of the wire telecommunications system, in accordance with the usual and customary standards of appraisal in the industry. No value shall be given to the license itself, nor to any intangible asset claimed by the licensee. 
(4)  Upon receiving the reports of the three (3) appraisers, the Mayor and Board of Commissioners shall have the right to purchase the wire telecommunications system from the licensee for the value set by any two (2) of the appraisers; or if no two (2) of the appraisers agree, then for the value that is the lesser of the average of the values set by all three (3) appraisers and the average of the values set by the Mayor and Board of Commissioner's appraiser and the third appointed appraiser. 
(5)  The purchase price shall be paid in cash to the licensee, or the licensee's successor in interest, within ninety (90) days after the Mayor and Board of Commissioners decides to purchase the wire telecommunications system. All right, title, and interest in the system shall transfer to the City upon presentation of the payment. 
(6)  The Mayor and Board of Commissioners may grant a period of time during which the licensee may continue to operate the wire telecommunications system. After the purchase has been consummated, to enable the licensee to conclude the licensee's business in an orderly manner, and to enable the City to assume control of the system in an orderly manner. During this transitional period, the licensee shall cooperate fully with any persons appointed or employed by the City to assume the management of the system. 
(7)  If the Mayor and Board of Commissioners decide not to purchase the system, after having revoked and terminated the license, either under this section or section 108-31 (transfers), then the licensee shall have six (6) months in which to remove the licensee's cables and other equipment from the City's streets, easements, sidewalks, and rights-of-way. The licensee shall restore any public property disrupted, damaged, or moved in the course of removing the cable system. If such work is not completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer within sixty (60) days, the City may complete the work at licensee's expense. 
(8)  In order to avoid loss of service to licensee's users after termination and revocation of license, the City may contract with a third party to operate such licensee's system or to transfer licensee's facilities to another operator.

(c)  The licensee shall interrupt system service after 7:00 a.m. and before 1:00 a.m. only with good cause and for the shortest time possible, and, except in emergency situations, only after giving notice that service will be interrupted. Service may be interrupted between 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. for routine testing, maintenance and repair, without notification, any night except Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, or the night preceding a holiday. 
(d)  The licensee shall maintain a written record listing date and time of trouble and service complaints, identifying the user, and describing the nature of each complaint and when and what action was taken by the licensee in response thereto; such record shall be kept at the licensee's office, reflecting the operations for the immediately preceding six (6) months, and shall be available for inspection by the City Communications Officer from time to time upon reasonable request therefor. 
(e)  In addition to the above requirements, the licensee shall comply with any customer service standards under applicable law. To the extent that such requirements differ, the licensee shall comply with the more stringent of such requirements.

(e)  The rights reserved to the City under this section are in addition to all other rights of the City, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right, or failure to exercise any right, with respect to such letter of credit shall affect any other right of the City.

Sec. 114-249. - Rates and charges; use of funds of agency; cutting off sewer and water service to delinquents. 
(a)  The existing user rates and charges as established by the Existing Agencies shall be adopted by the Agency. All user rates and charges to be collected from all the real property within McCracken County served by facilities of the Agency shall remain in effect until such time as an adjustment thereof has been approved by the Paducah City Commission and McCracken County Fiscal Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all tap-on fees previously established by the Existing Agencies on existing sewer lines at the time the Agency is created shall not be changed. Any proposed adjustments of the schedule of rates and charges shall be recommended by the Agency at a joint meeting of the Paducah City Commission and McCracken County Fiscal Court. The Paducah City Commission and McCracken County Fiscal Court shall approve or disapprove all rate changes recommended by the Agency by majority vote of each body. Neither the Paducah City Commissioner nor the McCracken County Fiscal Court shall have the authority to initiate rate changes. If for any reason the Paducah City Commission and McCracken County Fiscal Court cannot agree to amendments to a rate schedule, the current schedule shall remain in effect until such time as an agreement can be reached. The schedule of rates and charges may be based upon either: 
(1)  The consumption of water on-premises connected with the facilities, taking into consideration commercial and industrial use of water; 
(2)  The number and kind of plumbing fixtures connected with the facilities; 
(3)  The number of persons served by the facilities; 
(4)  May be determined by the Agency on any other basis or classification which the Agency determines to be fair and reasonable, whether similar or dissimilar to those enumerated; except that the schedule shall be equitable for all residential property. Provided, however, pursuant to HB 739, enacted by the 2002 Kentucky General assembly, if the Paducah City Commission, McCracken County Fiscal Court and the Agency find that local needs warrant uniformity of rates for all residential property shall not be required for a period of no more than ten (10) years from the date the Agency was established on July 1, 1999; or 
(5)  Any combination thereof. 
This schedule may include additional charges for treatment of sewage, with a surcharge where the sewage contains industrial waste or other waste in excess of limitations established by the regulations of the Agency. 
(b)  Prior to modification of the schedule of rates and charges, the Agency shall adopt a proposed schedule and publish notice thereof pursuant to KRS ch. 424 . The notice so published shall be dated as of the date of first (1st) publication thereof and shall state that the proposed or revised schedule of rates and charges will remain open for inspection in the office of the Agency for thirty (30) days from the date of the notice, and that objections thereto in writing may be filed during that period with the Agency by any person aggrieved thereby. The Board shall examine and hear any and all complaints, may modify the proposed schedule, and may recommend to the Paducah City Commission and McCracken County Fiscal Court a final schedule within sixty (60) days after the date of the notice. The schedule so adopted and established shall thereafter be the rates and charges for the use of the facilities of the Agency by users within McCracken County until changed in the manner provided herein. The schedule of rates and charges shall be established and revised from time to time so as to produce aggregate revenues to the Agency sufficient: 
(1)  For the payment of interest on and principal of all revenue bonds and other obligations of the Agency; 
(2)  For the payment of all costs and expenses of operating and maintaining the sewer system of the Agency, including, but not limited to, that portion of the salaries, wages, and fees of all officers and employees of the Agency; and 
(3)  For the payment of all costs of renewals and replacement of such system within McCracken County; provided, however, that all expenses, salaries, wages, and fees necessary or incident to improvements for the account of which bonds are issued or other indebtedness incurred may be included as a part of the cost of the improvements and paid from the proceeds of the bonds or other indebtedness. 
The use of all monies of the Agency received from any and all sources shall be limited exclusively and devoted solely to the payment of all obligations of the Agency and no funds from any sources shall be diverted to any other purposes than those described in this division. 
(c)  Whenever any sewer rates or charges for services rendered remain unpaid for a period of thirty (30) days after the same becomes due and payable, the Agency shall declare the property, the owner thereof, and the user of the service, delinquent until such time as all rates and charges are fully paid, and may cut off the sewer connection and service. The Agency may enter into agreements with any water company or water service, public or private, providing for the discontinuance of water service to delinquents.

Sec. 126-63. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Continuation generally. The lawful use of a building or land existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived and amendments hereto may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this article, except as otherwise provided herein. 
(b)  Specific standards. 
(1)  A nonconforming use or structure existing at the time of the adoption of this article, which was conforming at the time of its erection, may be continued in use, although such use does not conform to the provisions of such regulations. 
(2)  With the formal authorization of the Board of Adjustment granted after a public hearing duly advertised and after its determination that the properties in the general vicinity will not be adversely affected by the change, an existing nonconforming use may be changed to a new nonconforming use in the same or a more restrictive zone classification. 
(3)  A building or structure which is the subject of a nonconforming use may be maintained and repaired, but may not be enlarged or moved on the lot on which it is situated. 
(4)  A building or structure which does not comply with the dimensional requirements of this article may be maintained, repaired, altered or moved, provided that every portion so enlarged or moved shall be made to conform to all the regulations of the zone in which the structure is located. 
(5)  A building or structure which is nonconforming, either with respect to its use or with respect to dimensional requirements on the lot where it is situated, which is damaged or destroyed by any cause to the extent of more than seventy-five (75) percent of its value or area, shall not be repaired or rebuilt except in conformance with the provisions of this article. 
(6)  Additions to nonconforming structures. On any lot where there is an existing principal structure which was conforming at the time it was constructed, but which has become nonconforming with respect to front, rear or side yard requirements, and which otherwise complies with the use and dimensional requirements of this article, an addition to that structure may be constructed which similarly does not conform to the front, rear or side yard requirements; provided the newly created nonconformity is no nearer to the front, side or rear lot line than the previously nonconforming existing structure.

No lot, even though it may consist of one (1) or more adjacent lots in the same ownership at the time of passage of this article, shall be reduced in size so that lot width or size of yards or lot area per family or any other requirement of this article is not maintained. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public purpose. 
(b)  Multiple principal structures on a lot. One (1) principal structure may be erected on any one (1) lot. Accessory structures may potentially be located on adjacent lots of the same ownership as stipulated in section 62-76.

(c)  Public street frontage. Unless otherwise provided in this article, no building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut for at least twenty-five (25) feet on a public street. 
(d)  Existing lots. At the time of the enactment of this article, if an owner of a plot of land consisting of one (1) or more adjacent lots does not own sufficient continuous land to enable such owner to conform to the minimum lot size requirements provided herein, such plot of land may nevertheless be used as a building site. The dimensional requirements of the district in which the piece of land is located may be reduced by the smallest amount that will permit a structure of acceptable size to be built upon the lot. 
(e)  Variances to setback lines. Front yard setback lines may be varied where the average depth of principal buildings on adjoining properties is less than the depth prescribed elsewhere in this article. In such case, the front yard in question shall not be less than the average depth of existing front yards on the two (2) lots immediately adjoining.

(1)  Public utility installations; 
(2)  Government buildings and uses; and 
(3)  Public and parochial schools. 
(b)  Application and review procedure. 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use, the Board shall send a copy thereof to the Commission for its information and review as to the effect of the conditional use upon the master plan, and the Commission may present its recommendations thereon to the Board. The Board shall then proceed with a hearing on the application in the manner prescribed in this article. Following the hearing, and upon an affirmative finding by the Board that: 
a.  The proposed conditional use is to be located in a zone wherein such use may be permitted; and 
b.  The conditional use is consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of this article, will not substantially and permanently injure the appropriate use of neighboring property, and will serve the public convenience and welfare; 
the Board shall grant the conditional use. 
(2)  The Board of Adjustment may approve or deny any application for a conditional use permit. If it approves the issuance of a conditional use permit, it may attach conditions to the approval such as time limitations, requirements that one (1) or more things be done before construction can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature. Any such condition shall be recorded in the Board's minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific section of this article or any other applicable ordinance of the City listing the conditional use under consideration. 
(3)  The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to revoke conditional use permits for noncompliance with the conditions thereof. Furthermore, the Board shall have the right of action to compel offending structures or uses to be removed at the cost of the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost. 
(4)  The conditional use permits approved by the Board of Adjustment shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the office of the County Court Clerk. 
(5)  Approval of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant from complying with all the requirements of building, housing and other codes and regulations of the City. 
(6)  In any case in which a conditional use permit has not been exercised within one (1) year from its date of issuance, such conditional use may revert to its original zoning designation following a public hearing held by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with KRS ch. 424 . The term "exercised," as set forth in this subsection, means that binding contracts for the construction of the main building or other improvements have been let or, in the absence of contracts, that the principal building or other improvements are under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial investment are under contract, in development, or completed. When construction is not a part of the use, the term "exercised" means that the user is operating in compliance with the conditions as designated in the permit. 
(7)  The enforcement officer shall review all conditional use permits, except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once each year. The enforcement officer shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where the special use is located in order to determine if the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use permit. 
(8)  If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the enforcement officer shall report this fact in writing to the Chairperson of the Board of Adjustment. The report of the enforcement officer shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner or occupant is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit. A copy of this report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time (as nearly as is possible) it is furnished to the Chairperson of the Board. The Board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner and/or occupant at least one (1) week prior to the hearing. 
(9)  If the Board of Adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the report of the enforcement officer are true, and that the landowner and/or occupant has taken no action to comply with the conditions (as originally placed on the permit) between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the Board may authorize the administrative official to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit authorizes. 
(10)  Once the Board of Adjustment has completed a conditional use permit and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely and permanently satisfied, the administrative official, upon request by the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions have been satisfied and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have been satisfied and the conclusions in the margin of the copy of the conditional use permit which is on file with the County Court Clerk; thereafter the use in question, if it continues to meet the other requirements of this article, will be considered a permitted use.

(Code 1968, app. A, § 40.14; Code 1996, § 156.043; Code 1997, § 126-69; Ord. No. 76-10-1339, 10-26-1976) 
Sec. 126-70. - Planned unit development. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish a more flexible procedure for the approval, by the Commission, of development plans for large tracts of land and to encourage proper design by providing for the submission of such development plans by prospective developers. Tracts of land, as herein described, to be used for residential, commercial or industrial zone purposes, or certain combinations thereof, may be developed as a unit according to the following provisions: 
(1)  Land deemed one (1) lot. Any parcel of land including any interior street (or streets) which is designed as and used for a planned unit development may be deemed to be one (1) lot. 
(2)  Area requirements. In order that a tract be considered a planned unit development it must contain at least: 
a.  Two (2) acres if used for residential purposes only in an R-2 zone; three (3) acres if used for a combination of residential and business uses or business uses exclusively in an R-3 or R-4 zone. 
b.  Six (6) acres if used for residential purposes in an R-1 or R-2 zone; eight (8) acres if used for a combination of residential and business uses in an R-1 or R-2 zone. 
c.  Three (3) acres if used for a combination of residential and business uses in a POP, B-1, B-3 or HBD zone and six (6) acres if used for business purposes only in a POP, B-1, B-3 or HBD zone. 
d.  Ten (10) acres if used for industrial purposes in an industrial zone; fifteen (15) acres if used for a combination of uses within an industrial zone; however, if used for commercial purposes only in an M-1 or M-2 zone there shall be a minimum of five (5) acres. 
(3)  Applicability of zoning provisions. In any planned unit development, although it is permissible to depart from literal conformance with the individual lot dimension and area provisions, there shall be no decrease in the total equivalent lot area, parking area, and loading-unloading area provisions that would be necessary for the equivalent amount of individual lot development. The Planning Commission may allow reductions in these provisions, however, upon proof by the developer that efficiencies of large-scale development may permit such reductions without destroying the intent of this article. 
(4)  Application and preliminary plans. 
a.  An application for the establishment of a planned unit development shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning Administrator ten (10) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be acted on and shall be accompanied by twelve (12) copies of a preliminary development plan containing the following information: 
1.  The proposed name and location of the PUD, and names and addresses of all adjacent property owners and owners of the proposed PUD; 
2.  Vicinity map; 
3.  A complete and accurate legal description of the proposed PUD property; 
4.  A tabulation of the total acreage of the site designated for various uses (i.e., parking, all structures, residential or commercial, streets, parks or playgrounds); 
5.  Location of all structures in the PUD and proposed building densities (units per acre); 
6.  Preliminary subdivision plat, if the site is being divided, showing layout of all lots, which shall comply with the subdivision regulations; 
7.  Proposed circulation pattern, including private and public streets; 
8.  Parking layout with two (2) spaces per dwelling unit.

(5)  Procedure for approval; hearing; submission of final plans; time limit for commencement of construction. 
a.  Upon receipt of an application and site plan of the proposed development, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing as set out in KRS ch. 100 . The Planning Commission may approve, in concept, the preliminary development plans and shall have the authority to attach conditions to said plans to ensure that there is no departure from the intent of this article. Failure to submit a final development plan for Planning Commission approval within one (1) year of approval of preliminary plans shall terminate all proceedings and render the preliminary plans null and void. 
b.  Twelve (12) copies of the final development plans shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator for submission to the Planning Commission, and shall include the following: 
1.  All those requirements designated for submission with the preliminary plans; 
2.  Detailed landscaping plans, including and designating type of buffer or landscape screens placed between abrupt changes of land uses; 
3.  Detailed engineering plans or final subdivision plat showing site grading, street improvements, drainage and public utility locations; 
4.  Other conditions as applicable to the planned unit development; 
5.  Covenants, and any other agreements concerning construction, operation and administration of the area such as green areas, housing corporations, etc. 
c.  Upon approval of all the above by the Planning Commission, building permits may be issued by the Building Inspector provided all conditions have been met. 
d.  Construction shall be initiated within one (1) year from the date of final approval by the Planning Commission of the PUD. The Planning Commission may, however, grant an extension to the applicant, provided that: 
1.  A formal written request for the extension is presented to the Planning Commission at least ninety (90) days prior to the deadline; and 
2.  The written request explains the reasons that construction was not initiated within the time allotted. The Planning Commission shall review the original application and final development plans and shall inform the requestor of its decision within 31 days from the receipt of the request. 
e.  If the PUD is developed in stages, the total area will be reviewed at the public hearing and each successive stage shall be approved according to subsection (5)b of this section as it is submitted. 
f.  The site of the approved PUD shall be marked on the official zoning map of the City.

Sec. 126-71. - Off-street parking and loading areas. 
(a)  Intent. It shall be the intent of this section to provide guidance for district parking and loading/unloading standards as required by this chapter. Unless otherwise provided for in the individual district's regulations, this section shall govern. Furthermore this section is intended to: 
(1)  Ensure that adequate maneuvering, circulation and points of ingress and egress are provided; 
(2)  Provide an adequate number of off-street parking spaces and loading/unloading bays and maneuvering areas for every property use; 
(3)  Ensure that individual parking sizes will be large enough for the intended use of specific properties; 
(4)  Provide a safe and efficient interface between the street and road system and the parking and loading/unloading areas. 
(b)  General regulations. The following parking and loading/unloading requirements represent minimum standards. Applicants are urged to properly assess their respective needs and provide additional space as needed. 
(1)  Location on other property. If the required parking spaces cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, such spaces may be provided on other off-street property within four hundred (400) feet of the main entrance to the principal use. Such spaces shall be associated with the principal use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. Furthermore, when parking space must be provided on such other property, a written agreement signed by the owners of the subject properties must accompany the application for parking layout. 
(2)  Variances. When it can be clearly shown that an intended use shall require less parking or loading/unloading area than that which is required by this section because of significant variation in operation or activity, the Planning Commission may grant a reduction in the parking and loading/unloading requirements. 
(3)  Applicability. Off-street parking and loading/unloading shall be provided for any new building constructed, for new uses or conversions of existing conforming buildings, or for enlargements of existing structures. 
a.  For new uses, conversions or enlargements of existing conforming buildings, off-street parking, loading and unloading in compliance with these regulations shall be provided for the entire facility. 
b.  For enlargements of existing structures which do not conform to these regulations, required parking must equal the sum of those spaces furnished by the use prior to the enlargement and the number of spaces required by these regulations for any additional use area. 
c.  For buildings and sites containing storage buildings available for rent to the public, improved surfacing and design requirements of subsection (g) of this section, shall be required, regardless, if parking is required. For enlargements of existing facilities, complete conformance of this section is required. 
(4)  Multiple uses on site. For sites with more than one (1) use, the parking requirement shall be the sum of spaces required for each use, except as adjusted pursuant to subsection (j) of this section. 
(5)  Exemptions. Any use within the B-2, B-2-T and in the H-1 business districts is exempt from the off-street parking requirements provided by subsection (e) of this section. Any off-street parking facility constructed in these districts after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived must comply with the design standards set forth in subsections (d), (f), (g) and (h) of this section. 
(c)  Design approval. All lots or portions of lots being developed for vehicular parking which contain at least four (4) spaces, or at least one (1) loading/unloading area that provides one (1) space, shall have the design approval of the Planning Department and the Department of Engineering prior to issuance of a building permit.

ARTICLE VI. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 126-171. - Intent and scope. 
    It is the intent of this article to provide for the efficient, reasonable and impartial enforcement of this article by authorizing an enforcement officer, the basic procedure for complying with the article, and the penalties for violators. 
(Code 1968, app. A, art. VII; Code 1996, § 156.110; Code 1997, § 126-171; Ord. No. 76-10-1339, 10-26-1976) 
Sec. 126-172. - City Manager to appoint enforcement personnel. 
    All other provisions of this article and any other City ordinances notwithstanding, as of May 9, 1992, the City Manager shall have sole discretion for appointing personnel for the enforcement and administration of this chapter. This section shall have control over all other present ordinance provisions pertaining to enforcement and administration of this article. 
(Code 1968, app. A, § 70; Code 1996, § 156.111; Code 1997, § 126-172; Ord. No. 76-10-1339, 10- 26-76; Ord. No. 92-5-4773, 5-9-1992) 
Sec. 126-173. - Board of Adjustment. 
(a)  A Board of Adjustment (hereinafter known as "the Board") shall be appointed and organized in conformance with the KRS 100.217 . 
(b)  The Board shall have the following powers and duties: 
(1)  Bylaws. To adopt bylaws for its own government. 
(2)  Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the applicant that there is error in any order, requirement, permit, decision, determination or refusal made by the enforcement officer or other administrative official in the carrying out of this article, and for interpretation of the zoning map. 
(3)  Conditional uses. To hear and decide applications for conditional use permits that allow uses which are specifically named in the zoning provisions, and which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone if certain conditions are met. 
(4)  Variance. To hear and decide on applications for dimensional variance where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or unusual shape of the site, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or some other extraordinary situation or condition of that site, the literal enforcement of the dimensional requirements (height or width of building, or size of yards, but not population density) of the zoning provisions would deprive the applicant of reasonable capacity to make use of the land in a manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone. The Board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions it decides to grant. 
(5)  Findings for granting of variance. Before any variance is granted, the Board must find that the granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare, will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public and will not allow an unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In making these findings, the Board shall consider whether: 
a.  The requested variance arises from special circumstances which do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity or in the same zone; 
b.  The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and 
c.  The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is sought. 
(6)  Nonconforming use change. To permit a change from one (1) nonconforming use to another, providing the new nonconforming use is in the same or a more restrictive zoning classification in accordance with section 126-63. 
(7)  Limits of authority. The Board of Adjustment shall not possess the power to grant a variance to permit a use of any land, building or structure which is not permitted by the zoning provisions for the zone in question; or to alter density requirements in the zone in question. The Board does not possess the authority to permit a use not authorized by this article. 
(8)  Application of variance. A dimensional variance applies to the property for which it is granted, and not to the applicant. A variance also runs with the land, and is transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site. 
(9)  Additional authority. In granting a variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable in the furtherance of the purposes of this article. 
(10)  Conditions for granting variance. Before any variance is granted, the Board must find present conditions which must be sustained by evidence presented by the applicant that the property will not yield a reasonable return if used in compliance with this article, that the conditions causing the hardship are unique and are not shared by the neighboring property in the same zone, and that the granting of the variance will not be in conflict with this article. These conditions must be alleged by the applicant and evidence must be produced by the applicant to substantiate these allegations. 
(11)  Report. A written report on each variance that is granted or denied by the Board shall be submitted to the City Commission with a copy retained in the files of the Planning Office. 
(Code 1968, app. A, § 80; Code 1996, § 156.112; Code 1997, § 126-173; Ord. No. 76-10-1339, 10-26-1976; Ord. No. 2003-6-6653, § 1, 6-10-2003; Ord. No. 2012-10-7979, § 2, 10-9-2012)

(1)  The City may employ a staff or contract with planners or other persons as it deems necessary to accomplish its assigned duties as delineated in KRS ch. 100 . 
(2)  The enforcement officer has initial authority for the literal enforcement of this article. The enforcement officer has no discretionary authority to allow any departure from the literal conformance with this article. 
(3)  The Board of Adjustment has authority to hear appeals from decisions of the enforcement officer, and to make literal interpretations of the pertinent provisions in order to correct any possible misinterpretation, and to make only those departures from a literal conformance of this article which are specifically delegated to it. 
(4)  The Circuit Court has jurisdiction to determine all questions and issues properly brought before it on appeal from the decisions of the Board of Adjustment or Planning Commission.

Sec. 126-175. - Procedure for appeals. 
(a)  An appeal to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person, firm or corporation aggrieved, or by any governmental officer, department, board or bureau affected by any decision of the Building Inspector based in whole or in part upon the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Such appeal shall be taken by filing with the Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. Said notice of appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days from the date upon which the notice of refusal of building permit or Certificate of Occupancy is mailed by the Building Inspector, and failure to file notice of appeals within thirty (30) days shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal. 
(c)  The Building Inspector shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(d)  The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. 
(e)  Upon the hearing, any person or party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.

Sec. 126-176. - Amendments and development plans. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this section is to provide guidance for the chapter amendment processes, including text and map amendments. It shall also be the intent of this section to guide the use of development plans, which may be used for a variety of planning and zoning processes, including map amendments. The Planning Commission in its obligation to promote the public health, safety, and general well-being shall consider, but not be limited to, the following in its amendatory and development plan considerations: 
(1)  The conservation of natural resources, which may include various wildlife forms, vegetation, steep slopes, surface water, ground water, floodplain, soils, geologically sensitive areas, air quality, noise, view sheds, sufficient sunlight exposure, etc.; 
(2)  The conservation of sites that have historic or architectural value; 
(3)  The provision for safe, efficient vehicular and pedestrian transportation, off-street parking and loading within the development and the community and neighborhood; 
(4)  The provision for sufficient open space and recreational opportunities; 
(5)  The compatibility of the overall site design (buildings, parking, circulation, signs, screening, and landscaping) and land use with the existing and projected future land use of the area; 
(6)  The provision for adequate drainage facilities to prevent runoff problems during times of peak precipitation and flooding to the site and the surrounding community/neighborhood. 
(7)  The provision that infrastructure needs shall, as they relate to essential services and infrastructure systems, be adequately addressed; 
(8)  The development plan's compliance with the comprehensive plan and all applicable regulations as per city ordinances and policies and other applicable laws and regulations. 
(b)  Initiation and actions required for amendment. This article, including both the text and the zoning map, may be amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed. A proposal for amendment to any zoning regulation may originate with the Planning Commission or with the City Commission, or with the owner of the property in question. Regardless of the origin of the proposed amendment, it shall be referred to the Planning Commission before adoption. 
(c)  Public notice of proposed amendments. 
(1)  The Planning Commission shall then hold at least one (1) public hearing after notice as required by KRS chs. 100 and 424. The Planning Commission shall send copies of the notice to property owners surrounding the proposed zoning change within a radius of two hundred (200) feet of the property proposed for a map amendment. 
(2)  All procedures for public notice and publication as well as for adoption shall be the same as for the original enactment of a zoning ordinance (KRS ch. 424 ). 
(d)  Findings required for granting amendment. Before any map amendment is granted, the Planning Commission must find that the map amendment is in agreement with the comprehensive plan, or, in the absence of such a finding, that one (1) or more of the following apply, and such findings shall be recorded in the minutes and records of the Planning Commission and City Commission: 
(1)  That the original zoning classification given to the property was inappropriate or improper; 
(2)  That there have been major changes of an economic, physical or social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the comprehensive plan and which have substantially altered the basic character of the area. 
(e)  Variances and conditional use permits. The Planning Commission may hear and finally decide applications for variances or conditional use permits when a proposed development plan requires a map amendment and one (1) or more variances or conditional use permits. The Planning Commission shall assume all powers and duties otherwise exercised by the Board of Adjustment pursuant to KRS ch. 100 and this chapter. The applicant for the map amendment may elect to have any variances or conditional use permits for the same development to be heard and finally decided by the Planning Commission at the same public hearing set for the map amendment, or by the Board of Adjustment as otherwise provided for by KRS ch. 100 and this chapter. 
(f)  Development plan requirements. 
(1)  When required. A preliminary development plan shall be required in the following instances: 
a.  The Planning Commission, as a condition to the granting of any zoning change, shall require the submission of a development plan which, where agreed upon, shall be followed; except for a single principal structure and accessory structures for a single-family dwelling, a duplex dwelling, a triplex dwelling, or a fourplex dwelling on a single lot or ownership parcel. As a further condition to the granting of a zoning change, the Planning Commission shall require that substantial construction be initiated within two (2) years following the enactment of the map amendment, provided that such zoning change shall not revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing. The development plan shall be a continuing condition for the area rezoned unless amended as required herein; 
b.  When there is a proposal for multiple principal buildings on a single ownership parcel or lot;

14.  For projects of one (1) acre or more, a note stating that no grading, stripping, excavation, filling, or other disturbance of the natural ground cover shall take place unless and until the Department of Engineering and Environmental Services has approved the developer's proposed soil erosion control procedures and, if required, a soil erosion control plan; 
15.  A signed owner's certification, as follows: 
"I (We) hereby certify that I am (We are) the owner(s) of the property shown and described hereon and that I (We) hereby adopt the Development Plan with My (Our) free consent, with the exception of such variances or other conditions of approval, if any, as are noted hereon or in the Minutes of the Paducah City Planning Commission. I (We) furthermore understand that buildings permits for construction can only be issued following this plan and that amendments to the plan can be made only by official Commission action"; 
16.  A preliminary development plan certification shall be signed by the Chairman if and when the plan is fully approved, as follows: "I hereby certify that the Development Plan shown hereon has been found to comply with the zoning ordinance Regulation for the City of Paducah, Kentucky, with the exception of such variances or other condition of approval, if any, as are noted hereon or in the Minutes of the City Planning Commission and that it has been approved as the official plan." 
b.  Contents of final development plan. A final development plan shall contain all information as required for preliminary development plans under the sections above, except that the plan information shall be of an exact nature, rather than approximate or general. 
(g)  Map amendment and development plan procedures. 
(1)  Preapplication conference. 
a.  Prior to any acceptance of a formal application for an amendment, the applicant shall meet informally with city staff to determine the following:

2.  How the proposed development relates to the comprehensive plan; 
3.  The various regulations that may apply to the proposed development; 
4.  An explanation of the required contents of the preliminary development plan, and any other required submission of materials; and 
5.  An explanation of the amendment process. 
b.  At the time of the meeting with the planning staff, the applicant should present a sketch plan, as outlined in subsection (f)(2)a of this section. 
(2)  Formal application. To formally request the Commission to consider action on any zone map amendment and/or preliminary development plan, the applicant shall file a complete application (with respect to all applicable provisions of this chapter and other city ordinances, regulations and policies), pay the filing fee, and provide copies of all written and graphic material as required. Also the date for the public hearing will be set. 
(3)  Refiling. Upon reenacted amendment proposals, the applicant must wait one (1) year before reapplying with the same proposal, unless the Planning Commission grants unanimous permission to resubmit sooner. 
(4)  Review. The planning staff shall send the development plan to concerned agencies and interests for their respective technical review. If necessary, or requested by the applicant, the interest and technical review bodies may meet together to resolve, if possible, all differences and difficulties associated with the development proposal. These meetings will be open to all interested parties, including the public. 
(5)  Planning Commission action. No development plans will be considered for Commission action until they have been reviewed by the appropriate review agencies or interests. The Commission may pursue the following action: 
a.  Approval. The development plan is ready for certification as presented. 
b.  Conditional approval. The development plan will be certified when the developer has complied with the conditions of approval set forth in the Commission's action on the development plan. 
c.  Disapproval. The development plan has been disapproved by the Planning Commission. To request new review and action, the developer must file a new application as set forth in this section. 
d.  Postponement. In circumstances where further resolution is required, the Commission may act, with the consent of the applicant, to postpone final action on the development plan until further information or resolution of conflicts can be ascertained. 
(6)  Final development (site) plans procedures. 
a.  Only after the Planning Commission has adopted the preliminary development plan, and has recommended to the City Commission the zone map amendment, and the City Commission has acted affirmatively on same, the applicant must present a final development plan as set forth in subsection (f)(2)c of this section prior to the issuance of a building permit. City staff will check the final development plan and ensure that: 
1.  The plan is in compliance with the preliminary development plan. 
2.  The plan is in compliance with the comprehensive plan, this chapter, other city ordinances, regulations or policies, and all other applicable laws and regulations. 
3.  Where appropriate the review agencies may assess the document and forward their comments to the City prior to final development plan approval. 
4.  When all final zoning or annexation plans are submitted the applicant shall also make a digital submission which complies with the requirements of section 102-39(d). 
b.  If the final development plan complies with subsection (g)(6)a of this section, the Planning Commission Chair will certify on the face of the plan that all planning requirements and applicable conditions have been satisfied. 
(h)  Amendments to development plans. Amendments to approved development plans can be made only by official Planning Commission action following a public hearing. Content, format, and procedures shall be the same as for the original submission. However, amendments which fully meet the requirements set forth hereinafter as minor amendments shall be approved and certified by the City without further action by the Planning Commission. 
(1)  Minor amendments defined. Minor amendments are intended to expedite approval in those situations where amendments are of minor significance and generally relate to the shifting of previously approved spaces. Such amendments: 
a.  Shall not decrease the overall land area in wards or other open spaces; 
b.  Shall not increase building ground area coverage, floor area, or height, or increase the number of dwelling units; 
c.  May increase building ground area coverage for accessory buildings; or principal buildings if additions are less than ten (10) percent and additional parking can be provided without disruption to major plan elements; 
d.  Shall not change the location or cross section of any street and shall not increase the number or change the location of street access points on arterial or collector streets; 
e.  May include a reduction in parking spaces only when an associated reduction in floor area or number of dwelling units would permit a lesser number of minimum required off-street parking spaces than required for the original development plan. To qualify as a minor amendment this reduction may not be less than would be required by the zoning district regulations. For any case where parking in excess of the minimum requirement was provided on the original development plan, that same number of spaces shall be provided in excess of the minimum requirement for the proposed minor amendment plan. 
(2)  Procedures for minor amendments. 
a.  Filing. To request approval of minor amendments to development plans, the developer shall file with the City a completed application form, and copies of the plan as required by the terms and conditions of the City's application form. 
b.  Review. The City shall review the plan for compliance with all applicable requirements and ordinances and shall consult with concerned agencies as appropriate to ensure proper plan review. Upon determination that all requirements have been met, city staff shall submit its finding to the Planning Commission Chair for certification. If any question arises as to compliance, however, the plan shall be referred to the Planning Commission. 
c.  Certification. Upon certification of approval by the Planning Commission Chair, City staff shall have copies of the plan prepared and distributed to other public agencies at the expense of the developer, and return the original plan tracing to the developer. 
(3)  Content and format of minor amendments. Minor amendments shall have the same content and format requirements as the original development plan, except that: 
a.  The title shall indicate the plan as a minor amendment; 
b.  A note shall be added listing the exact nature of the requested changes; 
c.  The following will be the required language for the Planning Commission Chair's certification: "I do hereby certify that this development plan amendment complies with zoning ordinance provisions regarding amendments to development plans." 
d.  Owners of interest will complete a certification to be signed and witnessed as follows: "I (We) do hereby certify that I am (we are) the only owner(s) of the property shown hereon, and do adopt this as my (our) development plan for the property," which will be required language for all property. 
(i)  Relationship to subdivision regulations. The relationships between development plans and the subdivision regulations are established as follows: 
(1)  Applicability of subdivision regulations. Although development plans are not subdivision plats, quite often the development plan does indicate a need or intent to subdivide property. For any such development plan, the design and improvement standards contained within the subdivision regulations shall be applied to proposals contained on the development plan. 
(2)  Combining plans. Development plans and preliminary subdivision plats may be combined. It is recognized that for certain development situations it can be advantageous to both the applicant and the Planning Commission to combine requirements for development plans and preliminary subdivision plats in order to streamline the development approval process while not reducing the quality of the review. The following provisions shall be applicable to any such combined plan: 
a.  The developer shall meet with city staff no later than five (5) working days in advance of the filing deadline to discuss the appropriateness of filing a combined plat. 
b.  The plan shall show all information required for a development plan (preliminary or final as appropriate) and all information required for a preliminary subdivision plat as set forth in the subdivision regulations. 
(3)  Substitution of plans. A preliminary or final subdivision plat may be substituted for development plans required in conjunction with map amendment requests. It is recognized that in certain cases a preliminary or final subdivision plat would be as appropriate or more appropriate to be considered in conjunction with a map amendment request than would a development plan. Generally, such situations involve developments where placement of structures will be tightly controlled by the streets, lot pattern, and requirements for placement of structures within the zone, and where the applicant sees fit to have plans prepared at the required level of detail for subdivision plats prior to receiving a zone change approval. When an applicant is required to provide a development plan in conjunction with a zoning map amendment request, the applicant may file a subdivision plat in place of the development plan, if deemed appropriate by the City. In any disputed case, the City shall make the final judgment as to whether a development plan or a subdivision plat is required. 
(4)  Administration. The City Manager shall designate the department and/or city officer responsible for the administration of this section other than those actions and procedures that specifically require Planning Commission or the Chair of the Planning Commission review, action, or signature. 
(5)  Enforcement. The responsibilities of enforcement of this section shall be as designated by the City Manager.

Sec. 126-178. - Penalty. 
    Where an act or omission is prohibited or declared unlawful in this chapter, and no penalty of fine or imprisonment is otherwise provided, the offender shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $500.00, or be imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days, or both, for each offense or violation. Every day the offense continues shall be deemed to constitute a separate offense.
