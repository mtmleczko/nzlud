PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Norridge, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through September 5, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

2.  The place where written bid specifications may be obtained; 
3.  The time and place for opening bids; 
4.  Any requirements for a bid deposit (if any) or the posting of a performance bond (if any); 
5.  The time, date and place for submission of bids (including deadlines); 
6.  The prevailing wage rates of employees to be engaged in public works (if any) and where to obtain the rates; 
7.  Other information necessary to inform prospective bidders of any special requirements. 
c.  Return receipt required. Bids will be sent marked "sealed" to the village administrator "return receipt required." 
d.  Receipt of sealed bids. Sealed bids will be required to be received by the village administrator as set forth in the notice to bidders by a specified date. Upon receipt of the bids, they will be time stamped with the date and time received. 
e.  Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of at least two persons who shall be: the village trustee who is the chairperson of the finance committee or his or her designee who shall be a village trustee; and the village administrator, at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The bids will be recorded on a spreadsheet by the village administrator or his or her designee, with all pertinent information. The amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as the village administrator deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded. The record and each bid shall be open to public inspection in accordance with the Illinois Freedom of Information Act. 
f.  Bid acceptance and bid evaluation. The finance committee will evaluate bids and provide a formal written recommendation to the village board of trustees for approval. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price, and be considered in evaluation for award, shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life-cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used, including past performance. Upon receiving bids or proposals, the finance committee chairperson, and village administrator, or his or her designee, will jointly check the quotes for accuracy, conformance to specifications, and budget. 
g.  Correction or withdrawal of bids. Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the village administrator. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be withdrawn by written notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. Any modification prior to the bid opening must be submitted in a sealed envelope prior to the scheduled opening of the bid. After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the village or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake may be permitted to withdraw its bid if: 
1.  The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document, but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or 
2.  The bidder submits evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. 
h.  Award. After review, a tabulation and recommendation shall be given to the chairperson of the finance committee for presentation to the village board of trustees. The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth below and in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a construction project exceeds available funds, the village administrator or his or her designee is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. In addition to price, the village board of trustees shall consider the following: 
1.  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
2.  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
3.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder; 
4.  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services; 
5.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or service; 
6.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service; 
7.  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies, or contractual services to the particular use required; 
8.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; 
9.  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid. 
i.  Multistep sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
j.  Rejection of bids. The village board of trustees shall have the authority to reject all bids, parts of bids, or all bids for any one or more supplies or contractual services included in the proposed contract, when the public interest will be served thereby. 
(e)  Procedures for competitive sealed proposals. 
(1)  Competitive sealed proposals. When the chairperson of the finance committee, in conjunction with the village administrator, determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the village, a contract may be entered into by the use of the competitive sealed proposals method. 
(2)  Request for proposals. Proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals. 
(3)  Public notice. Adequate public notice of the request for proposals shall be given in the same manner as provided in subsection (d)(3) herein, provided such notice shall not be given less than 20 calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of proposals. 
(4)  Receipt of proposals. Proposals shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of the identity of any offeror or the contents of any proposal to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. A register of proposals shall be prepared containing the name of each offeror, the number of modifications received, if any, and a description sufficient to identify the item offered. The register of proposals shall be open for public inspection only after contract award. 
(5)  Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors. 
(6)  Discussion with responsible offerors and revisions to proposals. As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible to being selected for award, for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors determined to be substantially equivalent shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of the identity of competing offerors or of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. 
(7)  Award. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the village, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made. Upon village board of trustees' approval, the involved parties will be notified. 
(f)  Responsibility of bidders and offerors. If the lowest responsive bidder is found not responsible, a written determination of no responsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the village. The unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to promptly supply information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of no responsibility with respect to such bidder or offeror. 
(g)  Prequalification of suppliers. Prospective suppliers may be prequalified for particular types of supplies, services and construction. The village shall determine the method of submitting prequalification information and the information required in order to be prequalified. 
(h)  Bid and performance bonds on supply or service contracts. Bid and performance bonds or other security may be required for supply or service contracts as the village deems advisable to protect the village's interests. Any such bonding requirements shall be set forth in the solicitation. Bid or performance bonds shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a bidder or offeror's responsibility. 
(i)  Cancellation of invitations for bids or requests for proposals. An invitation for bids, a request for proposals or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation by the village when it is in the best interests of the village. Notice of cancellation shall be sent to all persons solicited. The reasons therefor shall be made part of the contract file. Each solicitation issued by the village shall state that the solicitation may be canceled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected in whole or in part when in the best interests of the village. The reason(s) for rejection shall be provided upon request by unsuccessful bidders or offerors. 
(j)  Emergency purchases. In cases of emergency situations where it is necessary to protect life or property or where it is pivotal to continue an essential service or a service necessary to protect the public health and safety, and such situation occurs after normal working hours or on a weekend, an emergency purchase may be made. In such an instance the department head will notify the village administrator and the village president. All emergency purchases must be approved by the department head, village administrator and the village president. 
For those emergency purchases of $20,000.00 or greater for goods and services the village president or village administrator, as the case may be, will notify the village board of trustees prior to expenditure. If a majority of the board is unavailable, the president or village administrator, as the case may be, may authorize the department head to enter into an emergency purchase with follow-up notification to the village board of trustees. 
(k)  Nondiscrimination compliance. Illinois human rights laws require that any contractor or vendor to the Village of Norridge and other public bodies in the State of Illinois agree to be bound by Illinois human rights laws and their nondiscrimination requirements. The law requires a nondiscrimination clause be included in the village's contracts and contract specifications. The requirements of a nondiscrimination clause shall be included in all contracts and contract specifications. The required language shall be in the form of the following typed statement on the applicable document: 
This [contract or contract specification] incorporates by reference the equal employment opportunity clause which the Illinois Department of Human Rights requires in all contracts and contract specifications. This clause is set forth in 44 Ill. Admin. Code Sec. 750 (Appendix A) and is contained in the village's purchasing and contracting policy. By acceptance of this contract, the [vendor or contractor] agrees to comply with the clause and all other rules and regulations of the Illinois Department of Human Rights covering employment opportunity. The [vendor or contractor] also acknowledges that it has a written sexual harassment policy which complies with Section 2-105 of the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/2-105. 
(l)  Prevailing Wage Act. All contractors hired by the village for construction projects shall abide by the prevailing rate of wages for laborers, workmen and mechanics. 
(m)  Cooperative purchasing. 
(1)  This is a method by which two or more separate governmental entities combine their requirements for certain items and receive bids for the combined amount. The advantage of cooperative purchasing is that it presents a large single transaction in regard to volume; therefore, a lower bid price is almost certain to follow. Such cooperative or intergovernmental bidding procedures will satisfy the village's requirements for bidding. 
(2)  State/GSA purchasing: Certain items are let for bids by the Procurement Division of the State of Illinois or through the United States Government (GSA). Purchases through State of Illinois or GSA purchasing will satisfy the requirement for bidding but are subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Prior approval by the village administrator is required for all purchases made through state or GSA purchasing. 
b.  For all purchases pursuant to this subsection in excess of $5,000.00 a completed purchase request form is required. 
c.  Village board approval is required where the purchase amount is $20,000.00 or greater. 
(3)  A purchase through cooperative purchasing as set forth in this section shall not require competitive bidding by the village. 
(n)  Insurance. A contractor or vendor shall not commence work nor shall the village permit any contractor or vendor, under any contract with the village to commence work, until the contractor or vendor has first obtained all insurance required under this paragraph, and such insurance has been approved by the village; nor shall a contractor allow any subcontractor to commence work on a subcontract until all similar insurance required of the subcontractor has been approved by the village. A contractor or vendor agrees to provide and maintain certificates of insurance evidencing the minimum insurance coverage and limits set forth below during the term of the contract, unless village ordinance or bidding requirements specify a greater amount or additional type of insurance, then such greater amount or type of insurance will be required. Such policies shall be in force and from companies acceptable and satisfactory to the village to afford protection against all claims for damages to public or private property, and injuries to persons, arising out of and during the contract term. A copy of the certificate of insurance shall name the Village of Norridge, its officers, agents, employees, representatives and assigns as additional insured. The policy of insurance shall contain no provisions that invalidate the naming of the village as additional insured. The insurance coverage and limits set forth below shall be deemed to be minimum coverage and shall not be construed in any way as a limitation on contractor's duty to carry adequate insurance or on contractor's liability for losses or damages under this contract. The minimum insurance coverage and limits that shall be maintained by the contractor and his sub-contractors at all times while providing, performing or completing the work are as follows: 
(1)  Worker's compensation: The contractor is required to carry, with a company authorized under the laws of the State of Illinois, a policy for protection against liability under the Worker's Compensation and the Occupational Disease Statutes of the State of Illinois with limits of not less than $500,000.00 per claim. 
(2)  General liability: The contractor shall carry a comprehensive general umbrella liability policy for all operations with limits of not less than $1,000,000.00 each accident for bodily injury liability and not less than $1,000,000.00 each accident for property damage liability. 
(3)  Professional liability insurance: The contractor shall carry minimum of $1,000,000.00. 
(4)  Automobile insurance: The contractor shall carry minimum of $1,000,000.00. 
All such insurance must include an endorsement whereby the insurer agrees to notify the village at least 30 days prior to non-renewal, reduction or cancellation. The contractor shall cease operations if the insurance is canceled or reduced below the required amount of coverage. All costs for insurance as specified herein will not be paid for separately, but shall be considered as incidental to the contract. 
(Ord. No. 1668-10, § 4, 1-13-2010; Ord. No. 1743-12, § 2, 5-9-2012; Ord. No. 1758-12, § 2, 9-26-2012; Ord. No. 1808-14, § 2, 9-24-2014; Ord. No. 1825-15, § 2, 4-8-2015)

(b)  Interest of village officers and employees. No officer or employee of the village shall be directly or indirectly financially interested in any contract, work or business of the village, or the sale of any article, the expense, price or consideration of which is paid from the treasury, or by any assessment levied by any act or ordinance, or in the purchase of any real estate or other property.

Interest shall not include (i) interest in a mutual fund or managed account, (ii) an ownership interest of less than one percent in any business entity, or (iii) an interest of general applicability affecting others in similar situations. 
    Officer means all appointed and elected officials of the village, regardless of whether the officer is compensated; provided, however, that a member of a task force, blue ribbon committee, or similar group that is established solely for the purpose of advising the village board on policy issues shall not be considered an officer for the purposes of this section. 
    Recuse means to refrain from participation in any official discussion or deliberation regarding a transaction and to abstain from any vote on such transaction. 
    Transaction means any matter, including without limitation contracts, work, or business with the village, the sale or purchase of real estate by the village, and any requests for zoning, development, or subdivision approvals, including without limitation rezonings, variations, and special use permits, pending before the village, upon which an officer or employee performs an official act or action. 
(d)  Use of confidential information. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any officer or former officer or any employee or former employee knowingly to use confidential information for actual or anticipated personal gain, or for the actual or anticipated personal gain of any other person. 
(e)  Conflicts of interest. 
(1)  No officer or employee shall participate in any official action that would constitute a conflict of interest under the statutes or common law of the State of Illinois. 
(2)  In addition to the requirements of subsection (e)(1) above, no officer or employee shall have an interest in, or have a family relationship with a person having an interest in, a transaction that is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties in the public interest or that may impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties. 
(3)  Any officer or employee shall recuse himself or herself in connection with any transaction that comes before such officer or employee in the course of his or her official duties, whenever such officer or employee has actual knowledge that he or she has (i) any interest in the transaction, (ii) any family relationship with a person having an interest in such transaction, or (iii) any interest in an applicant appearing before the officer or employee in an official capacity, even if the officer or employee does not have an interest in the transaction itself.

b.  If a village appointed officer or employee has or develops a conflict of interest with respect to a village matter or if any other employee or consultant has or develops such a conflict of interest and would be expected to advise or participate in the discussion of the issue that is the subject of the conflict, that person shall: 
1.  Make full written or other public disclosure of the conflict of interest. In such instance a village appointed officer or a department head shall notify the corporate authorities. Village employees are expected to report such a conflict to their department head; 
2.  Abide by any prohibitions or restrictions issued by the corporate authorities, or department head, as the case may be, with respect to participation in the resolution of the issue that is the subject of the conflict of interest. Such prohibitions or restrictions may include the officer or employee being excluded from any participation in the matter. 
If the conflict involves numerous issues or is so pervasive that it would render the person unable to properly carry out his or her obligations to the village, the person should recuse himself or herself from any involvement in the matter. 
(7)  Standard for determining conflict of interest. A conflict of interest is created when a non-village interest would cause an impairment of the officer's or employee's ability to exercise independent judgment on behalf of the village. The standard for determining impairment of independent judgment is objective rather than subjective and shall be whether a person of ordinary and reasonable judgment would be affected. 
Any of the foregoing notwithstanding, an officer or employee shall be deemed to have a conflict of interest in the following circumstances: 
a.  The officer or employee has or is about to acquire more than a one percent ownership interest in or is about to become an officer, director, management official, employee, attorney or other professional consultant in any entity seeking consideration from or attempting to establish a business relationship with the village. 
b.  The officer or employee is representing another person or entity as an advocate or consultant in a circumstance in which the other entity or person has an interest which is adverse to the interests of the village, or when that other entity or person is actively seeking consideration from the village.

The plan, as recommended by the plan commission and as thereafter adopted by the city, may be made applicable, by its terms, to land situated within the corporate limits and contiguous territory not more than 11/2 miles beyond the corporate limits and not included in any municipality. Such plan may be implemented by ordinances:

    The village board shall act as the board of local improvements for the village. The board of local improvements shall meet upon the call of the president or of any two members.

Any person convicted of a violation of any section of this Code, or any other ordinance of the village for which no specific penalty is provided, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in a sum of not more than $750.00 for each offense, unless otherwise provided in this Code for a specific offense. Where the penalty for a violation of an offense is contained in such section, the penalty so provided in that specific section shall control. Whenever the violation of a provision of any ordinance of the village would entitle the village to recover a fine, it shall not be necessary that said ordinance specifically say that a penalty is recoverable or specify the amount of such penalty; in all such cases, the penalty provision of this section shall be applicable and included automatically in such ordinance. In the construction and interpretation of this section, the revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered as a recovery or penalty so as to bar any other penalty being enforced. 
1.  In addition to, or in lieu of, any fine or penalty which may be imposed for violation of an ordinance of the village, a disposition of supervision may be entered by the court upon a plea of guilty or a stipulation by the defendant of the facts supporting the charge, or a finding of guilty. Pursuant to such disposition of supervision, the court may defer further proceedings and the imposition of a sentence, and enter an order for supervision of the defendant. 
2.  "Supervision" means a disposition of conditional and revocable release without probationary supervision, but under such conditions and reporting requirements as are imposed by the court, at the successful conclusion of which disposition the defendant is discharged and a judgment dismissing the charges is entered.

ARTICLE VIII. - LEGAL DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION FOR VILLAGE EMPLOYEES AND OFFICIALS 

Sec. 2-701. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide for legal defense services and indemnity for employees, members of boards and committees and elected officials of the Village of Norridge (village) who are sued or threatened with suit for damages allegedly caused by their actions. The intent is to provide legal defense services and indemnity to the fullest extent permitted by the home rule provisions of the Constitution of the State of Illinois and this article, even if such is inconsistent with state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 1556-06, § 2, 9-27-2006) 
Sec. 2-702. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Commissioners means the member(s) appointed by action of the village to a board or committee created pursuant to statute or ordinance of the village. It shall also include former commissioners and the estate or personal representative of the estate of a deceased commissioner. 
    Defendant means the employee, commissioner or elected official or former employee, former commissioner or former elected official sued or threatened with suit as appropriate to the context. 
    Elected officials means the village president, village trustees, and the village clerk, even if such person was appointed to fill out an unexpired term. It shall also include former elected officials or the estate or personal representative of the estate of a deceased elected official.

    Indemnity means to pay on behalf of the employee, commissioner or elected official part or all of a judgment based on such claim, action or proceeding or to reimburse the Employee, commissioner or elected official for all or part of any compromise or settlement of such claim, action or proceeding. 
    Legal defense services means undertaking legal representation of the person sued (or threatened with suit). Said legal representation shall be provided by the village attorney or other counsel expressly authorized by the village board to appear and defend against the claim, action or proceeding, or reimbursement of the employee, commissioner or elected official for part or all of his or her court costs and attorney's fees incurred in the defense of such claim, action or proceeding. Such reimbursement may include part or all of the cost of defense against a claim of willful and wanton conduct whether undertaken voluntarily or in accordance with subsection 2-703(d) below. 
    Reservation of rights agreement means an agreement between the village and the employee that provides for legal defense of the employee while reserving the rights of the village not to pay the judgment, compromise or settlement until it is established that the injury complained of arose out of an act or omission relating to the employee's duties and was not willful and wanton. 
(Ord. No. 1556-06, § 2, 9-27-2006) 
Sec. 2-703. - Employees. 
(a)  General-Duty to defend. If a claim, action, or proceeding is filed against an employee for damages allegedly arising out of the actions or omissions of such employee relating to his/her duties as an employee of the village, (regardless of whether such is alleged to be in his or her official or individual capacity, or both) unless the village attorney declines to appear and defend (or withdraws) on the basis that the employee was guilty of willful or wanton misconduct or despite the allegations, the actions or omissions complained of were not relating to his/her duties as an employee (see subsection (d) below), the village shall provide an employee's legal defense services and/or indemnity, to the extent determined by the village. Nothing herein shall preclude the village from undertaking such defense under a reservation of rights. 
(b)  Separate attorney if conflict of interest. Upon receipt of a declination to defend on the basis of potential or actual conflict of interests or upon withdrawal by the village attorney on the basis of an actual or potential conflict of interest, the employee may employ his/her own attorney to appear and defend, in which event, if, but for the conflict of interest only, the village would defend, the village shall pay the employee's court costs, litigation expenses and attorney's fees as they are incurred to the extent approved by the village board as reasonable. 
(c)  Criteria for determining if conduct was related to duties. In determining whether the conduct upon which the claim is based was related to or arose out of his/her duties as an employee, the following shall be considered: 
(1)  Whether the conduct is the kind the employee is employed or charged to perform; 
(2)  Whether it occurred substantially within authorized time and location limits; and 
(3)  Whether it was motivated, at least in substantial part, by a purpose to serve the village. 
(d)  Not related to duties/willful misconduct. 
(1)  In the event that the village board determines that the act or omission upon which the claim or action is based was not related to the employee's duties or was willful or wanton misconduct, the village shall have no duty to provide the defense services or indemnify unless a jury or court finds that the act or omission of the employee was related to his/her duties as an employee and was not willful or wanton misconduct, in which case the village shall indemnify the employee for any damages awarded, and court costs and attorney's fees assessed as part of any final and unreversed judgment. In such event, the village shall also pay the defendant's court costs, litigation expenses, and attorney's fees which are not assessed as part of any final and unreversed judgment, to the extent approved by the village board as reasonable charges and reasonably related to proper representation of the defendant. 
In all cases, the employee shall cooperate in good faith to have special interrogatories and/or jury instructions submitted to the court or jury to determine whether the conduct or inaction which gave rise to the claim or cause of action: (1) was or was not willful or wanton misconduct; and (2) was or was not intended to serve or benefit the interests of the village. 
(2)  The village may elect to defend the employee under a reservation of rights agreement. If the village so elects and if the employee enters into a reservation of rights agreement, the village shall pay the judgment, compromise or settlement only if it is established that the injury arose out of an act or omission relating to the employee's duties and was not willful and wanton. 
(e)  Effect of other proceedings. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment or settlement, conviction, or in a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the act giving rise to the claim did not arise out of actions or omissions of such employee relating to his/her duties as an employee of the village. 
(f)  Settlement. 
(1)  In any settlement, if the village board determines that the conduct or inaction which gave rise to the claim or cause of action was willful or wanton misconduct, or was not intended to serve or benefit the interests of the village, the village shall not indemnify the employee for any damages, court costs, or attorney's fees agreed to as part of the settlement. Otherwise, the case may be settled in the village board's discretion and with the employee's consent, and the village shall indemnify the employee for any damages, court costs, and attorney's fees agreed to as part of the settlement, or shall pay such settlement directly. Where the employee is represented by private counsel due to the village board declining to defend on the basis of an actual or potential conflict of interest, the village board shall be informed in writing of all settlement offers. The village board must approve any settlement in order to obligate the village to indemnify the employee. 
(2)  If, in the village board's sole discretion, the village determines that a settlement offer is reasonable and the village agrees in writing that it would fund such settlement, and the employee refuses to settle, the village will continue to defend and/or indemnify the employee; however, the extent of the village's liability for indemnity will then be limited to the amount of such settlement offer which the village would have accepted. Where the employee is represented by private counsel due to the village declining to defend on the basis of an actual or potential conflict of interest, the extent of the village's liability for indemnity will be limited to the amount of the settlement offer which the village indicated in writing it would accept, plus reasonable attorney fees incurred as of the date the village agreed in writing to the proposed settlement. 
(g)  Determination of coverage. 
(1)  If the village board determines that an employee does not come within the provisions of this article, and thus fails or refuses to provide an employee with a defense, and a court of competent jurisdiction later determines that such claim should have been determined to be within the provisions of this article, then the village shall pay any judgment rendered against the employee and reasonable costs and fees incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is covered by the provisions of this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to deprive an employee of the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to compel the village to perform the duties imposed by this article. 
(2)  If the village board determines that a claim against an employee comes within the provisions of this article, and if a court of competent jurisdiction later finds that such claim does not come within the provisions of this article, the village may seek reimbursement for any payments made by the village or on its behalf for part or all of any judgment and costs or fees incurred by or on behalf of the employee's defense as well as for the part or all of the costs or expenses incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is not covered by this article. 
(3)  If, after the village board determines that a claim against an employee comes within the provisions of the article, the village board comes into possession of new information that the claim against the employee does not come within the provisions of this article, the village board shall so notify the employee in writing. If a court of competent jurisdiction later finds that such claim does not come within the provisions of this article, the village may seek reimbursement for any payments made by the village or on its behalf for part or all of any judgment and costs or fees incurred by or on behalf of the employee's defense as well as for the part or all of the costs or expenses incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is not covered by this article. 
(Ord. No. 1556-06, § 2, 9-27-2006) 
Sec. 2-704. - Elected officials and commissioners. 
(a)  If an elected official, commissioner or hearing officer (as defined in chapter 2, section 2-553 of this Code) is sued or threatened with suit for damages allegedly caused by his or her actions, the village may provide legal defense service and/or indemnity, if the elected official or commissioner acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the village. Provided however, no such legal defense service or indemnification shall be provided with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person has been adjudged to be liable to the village unless, and only to the extent the court in which such action was brought, shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, and in view of all the circumstances, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper. 
    The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment or settlement, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption: 
(1)  That the person did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the village; and 
(2)  That with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing a judgment of conviction in circumstances other than stated hereinabove, may create such a presumption. 
(b)  The village may provide legal defense service and/or indemnity as set forth in subsection 2-704(a) to persons who formerly served as village president, village clerk, village trustee, commissioner or hearing officer if the basis of the claim or charge against such person arises out of such person's duties as an official of the village. 
(c)  Whether or not, and to the extent to which, if any, the village shall provide legal defense service and/or indemnification as set forth in subsection 2-704(a), shall be only as authorized in the specific case by a majority vote of the members of the village board then holding office who were not parties to such suit or action or, if there are less than three such disinterested members of the village board, by the village attorney. 
(Ord. No. 1556-06, § 2, 9-27-2006; Ord. No. 1771-13, § 2, 5-8-2013) 
Sec. 2-705. - Matters common to all defendants. 
(a)  Determinations under this article. Unless specifically reserved to the village board, all determinations to be made by the village in administering this article shall be made by the village attorney. 
(b)  Conflict of interest. In the event the village attorney determines that for the village to represent a defendant would place the village and the party defended in an actual or potential conflict of interest the village attorney shall promptly decline in writing to appear and defend or shall take appropriate action to withdraw as attorney for such party. 
(c)  Continuing review. The decision to provide or not provide defense services or indemnify may be reviewed and modified at any time when the interests of justice require, and legal defense services or payment therefor, even retroactively, may be authorized or denied, as well as indemnity. 
(d)  Duty of defendant to notify village. It is the obligation of the defendant to request in writing within 14 days after service of a claim, demand, notice, summons or other process upon the defendant that the village provide for defense. Such written request shall be filed together with the claim, demand, notice, summons, or other process with the village clerk and the village attorney. The village, at its sole discretion, may provide a defense for those who fail to make a timely request. 
(e)  Cross-complaints and counterclaims. For the purposes of this article, the village's duty and authority to defend and indemnify a defendant shall extend to a cross-complaint or counterclaim against such defendant, if in the determination of the village attorney, the cross-complaint or counterclaim meets the requirements as set forth for defense if such were contained in an original complaint, and notice is given as set forth in subsection 2-705(d). If the defendant wants to file a counterclaim or cross-complaint in any legal proceeding covered by this article, the village reserves the right to separate the costs of defense from the costs associated with presentation of counterclaim or cross-complaint. If the village exercises its right to separate such costs, the defendant shall be liable for all costs associated with the presentation of the counterclaim or cross-complaint. 
(f)  Control of litigation. Whenever the village provides for the defense of any action set forth in this article, as a condition of such defense, the village may assume exclusive control over the representation of such defendant, provided, however, that any defendant may at any time, at the option of the defendant, take control over representation by waiving all rights to all or part of the indemnification provided herein and rights to payment for costs of defense. 
(g)  Insurance. If any insurance policy provides coverage of the defendant for the allegations made, the village's obligation to pay for legal representation, settlement, judgment, or costs or fees, shall be secondary to such insurance, and the village's obligation to defend and/or indemnify will not begin until the limits of all such insurance policies are exhausted. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to modify or amend any provisions of any insurance policy in which a defendant is a named insured. 
(h)  Non-cooperation. In the event that a defendant fails or refuses to comply with any of the conditions of this article or fails or ceases to cooperate in good faith, then all the provisions of this article shall be inapplicable and have no force or effect with respect to any such claim or litigation from the time such failure to cooperate first occurs. In such event, the village will notify the defendant of the inapplicability of this article in writing. 
    If a defendant fails or ceases to cooperate in good faith, but later resumes cooperation in good faith, the village board may reinstate the benefits of this article as to such defendant as the village board deems appropriate. Failure to cooperate in good faith implies the conscious doing of wrong or actions taken for a dishonest purpose. It involves the actual or constructive fraud or design to mislead or deceive the village, or neglect or refusal to fulfill a duty not prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights or duties. 
(i)  Village may employ independent counsel. The village may provide for the defense of a defendant pursuant to this article by employing independent counsel for this purpose or by asserting the village's right under any appropriate insurance policy which requires the insurer to provide the defense. 
(j)  Collective bargaining agreement. If a collective bargaining agreement covers any of the provisions of this article, all employees under such collective bargaining agreement shall be governed by the provisions thereof rather than the provisions of this article and if any conflict exists between the provisions of this article and the provisions of any such collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement shall control. 
(k)  Punitive or exemplary damages. Where punitive or exemplary damages are permitted by Illinois law and where the village has a contract of insurance providing for same the village is authorized to pay that part of a judgment that is for punitive or exemplary damages if the village board finds all of the following: 
(1)  The court judgment is based on an act or omission of an elected official, commissioner or employee acting in a manner that was related to or arose out of his/her duties as an elected official, commissioner or employee; and 
(2)  That at the time of the act giving rise to the liability, the elected official, commissioner or employee acted or failed to act, in good faith, without actual malice, and in the apparent best interests of the village; and 
(3)  Payment of the claim or judgment would be in the best interests of the village. 
(l)  No modification of immunity or liability intended. Nothing in this article shall be construed as abrogating or waiving any limitation of liability or immunity presently or hereinafter made applicable to the village or a defendant which would otherwise be applicable to any action or proceeding to which this article would apply. 
(Ord. No. 1556-06, § 2, 9-27-2006) 
Sec. 2-706. - Village action against employee, commissioner or elected official. 
    In the event the village maintains any action or claim against an employee, commissioner or elected official, whether as plaintiff, claimant, cross-plaintiff, or counter-plaintiff, petitioner or otherwise, no legal defense services or indemnity will be provided.

ARTICLE III. - UNDERAGE PERSONS 

Sec. 6-121. - Provisions to and use of alcoholic liquor by underage persons. 
A.  Delivery of alcoholic liquor to an underage person. It shall be unlawful for any person, regardless of relationship, age or circumstances, to deliver any alcoholic liquor to any underage person, except as set forth in subsection C. of this section. 
B.  Use of premises for consumption of an alcoholic liquor. It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly permit or knowingly or negligently fail to prevent, on any premises under his or her control, the consumption of an alcoholic liquor by an underage person. This section shall apply to residential, public and commercial premises. 
C.  Exceptions. Subsections A. and B. of this section shall not apply in the following circumstances: 
1.  The performance of a bona fide religious service. 
2.  The delivery of an alcoholic liquor within the home to an underage person, by and under the direct supervision of that underage person's parent. However, the following rules shall be applied to this subsection: 
a.  In any prosecution of an underage person for the commission of any state or local offense, the prosecutor, upon reasonable ground, may request a ruling and the court shall rule as to whether the consumption of an alcoholic liquor, as permitted by the parent, was a contributing factor to the commission of the offense. If it is so determined in the affirmative, then the penalty set forth in subsection D. of this section shall apply. For purposes of this subsection, the consumption of alcohol may be determined to be a contributing factor if it had the effect of substantially causing an impairment to the person. For purposes of this section "impairment" shall mean any diminution or compromise of a person's physical, mental or perceptual abilities due to the consumption of an alcoholic liquor. Impairment does not require that the blood alcohol content be in excess of any particular gram of alcohol to milliliters of blood or breath ratio." It need not be shown that, but for the consumption of alcohol, the offense would not have been committed. 
b.  The parent shall remain vicariously liable as set forth in subsection E. of this section. 
D.  Penalty. Any person found guilty of violating subsection A. or B. shall be fined $1,000.00 for each occurrence. 
E.  Vicarious liability of a parent or other person facilitating the use or abuse of alcoholic liquor. The following persons shall be liable to any individual who has been injured by an alcohol impaired underage person when the impairment is a contributing cause of injury: 
1.  Any person who delivered or permitted the delivery of an alcoholic liquor to the underage person. The person making or permitting the initial delivery to an underage person remains liable to anyone injured by the same or different underage person regardless of how many times the alcoholic liquor changed hands. 
2.  Any person in control of a premises who knowingly or negligently fails to maintain supervision to such an extent that an alcoholic liquor is consumed on the premises by an underage person. 
3.  Any person who knowingly or negligently allows the operation of a motor vehicle under his or her control by an underage person, when the person knew or in the exercise of ordinary judgment should have known that the underage person was either impaired or had consumed any amount of alcohol within two hours prior to when this allowance to drive occurred. 
The vicarious liability established by this section shall not be subject to the limitations on damages as set forth in 235 ILCS 5/6-21. 
F.  Use of false identification. Any underage person found guilty of attempting to obtain delivery of an alcoholic liquor by use of false proof of age shall be subject to a fine of $500.00. If the false proof of age was an improperly used driver's license, the person so using it shall not be permitted, for a period of six months, to operate a motor vehicle on any public way within the corporate limits of the village unless accompanied by a licensed driver over 30 years of age. 
G.  False identification not a defense. It shall not be a defense to any action brought criminally, civilly or administratively against any liquor licensee or any other person charged with the delivery of any alcoholic liquor to an underage person that such a person produced false identification or false proof of age. The person or persons hearing and deciding the charges may consider such a claim when determining the penalty to be assessed or the apportionment of damages. 
H.  Operation of a motor vehicle while in a state of impairment. It shall be unlawful for any underage person to operate a motor vehicle on a street or highway of the village while in a state of impairment due to the consumption of an alcoholic liquor or with any alcohol at all in his or her system. For purposes of this section only, "operation of a motor vehicle" shall have the definition ascribed to it in the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
I.  Operation of a motor vehicle by underage persons with an alcoholic liquor in or on the vehicle; when the underage person is impaired due to alcohol or has alcohol in the system or is operating the vehicle in violation of a restriction pursuant to this chapter. The following shall apply when any underage person is found in the Village of Norridge operating any motor vehicle in which or on which is found any alcoholic liquor, or when the underage person is in a state of impairment due to consumption of alcohol or has alcohol in his or her system or is found operating a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction pursuant to this chapter: 
1.  The motor vehicle shall be subject to immediate impoundment by the police department. 
2.  The following factors shall not be considered in determining whether or not to impound the motor vehicle: 
a.  Whether the alcoholic liquor is an opened or an unopened container. 
b.  Whether the operator is the owner of the alcoholic liquor in the vehicle. 
c.  Whether the operator had knowledge of the existence of the alcoholic liquor within the motor vehicle. 
3.  Upon impoundment, the motor vehicle may be released only to another person showing proof of ownership or lease rights to the motor vehicle. 
a.  If the underage (under 21 years of age) operator is the owner or lessor of the vehicle, then the vehicle may be released only to a parent or spouse of the underage owner. If the underage person has no parent or spouse living in the immediate area, the vehicle may be released, upon satisfactory proof of such fact, as set forth in the subsection 4. of this section. 
4.  The motor vehicle may not be released to any person who was a passenger in the motor vehicle at the time the alcoholic liquor or impairment was found unless at least 24 hours have passed from the time of the finding. 
5.  The vehicle shall not be released until the person seeking the release has paid an administrative fee of $200.00 to the village, plus any towing or storage costs. 
6.  If the operator is subsequently found guilty of driving with open alcohol in a motor vehicle or possession of alcohol by a minor or of operating a motor vehicle while impaired pursuant to subsection H. of this section, that person shall not be permitted for a period of six months to operate a motor vehicle on any public way within the limits of the village unless accompanied by a licensed driver over 30 years of age. 
7.  The above obligations and penalties shall be in addition to the penalties that may be assessed in a court of law for any charges incident to the stop. 
8.  Any law enforcement officer, the police department and the village and any of its officers or agents shall be absolutely immune from any liability or exposure to liability of any kind or nature for the enforcement or implementation of this section. 
J.  Procedure for driving restriction notification; hearing. 
1.  If a person has committed a violation that subjects the person to a restriction on driving in the Village of Norridge, such a restriction shall not take place until the police department has sent, by regular mail, a notice of the pending driving restriction. The notice shall be mailed at least two weeks before the restriction is to go into effect and shall contain: (1) a statement that the restriction applies only to the Village of Norridge; (2) the date the restriction is to go into effect and the date on which it ends; (3) a map showing the village limits; (4) a notice that the operator has the right to request a hearing within ten days of notification to determine the validity of the restriction. The validity of the restriction may be challenged only on the grounds that the person was not the actual person found guilty or that there was no finding of guilty for the underlying offense. 
2.  The hearing shall be conducted by a supervisory member of the village police department, appointed by the chief of police, whose determination shall be final. 
K.  Penalty for violating driving restriction. 
1.  Restriction: No person shall operate and no person, including a parent, shall permit another to operate a motor vehicle within the corporate limits of the village in violation of the restrictions set forth in this chapter. 
2.  Penalty: Any person found guilty of violating this subsection shall be fined in the mandatory amount of $500.00. 
L.  Zero tolerance with respect to alcohol use. It shall be unlawful for any underage person to have any alcohol of any level detectable by observation or blood/alcohol testing in the person's system. If the blood/alcohol level is less than .05 milliliters of alcohol per liter of blood, then it shall be a defense that the alcohol was acquired pursuant to the exceptions set forth in subsection C. of this section. Such defense may be established by clear and convincing evidence and by the testimony of the adult providing the alcoholic liquor.

No prohibition under this section, however, shall apply to any licensed premises such as, without limitation, a restaurant or food shop, where selling, giving or delivering alcoholic liquor is not the principal business of the licensee at those premises. In those instances where a person under the age of 21 years is prohibited from entering and remaining on the premises, proof that the defendant-licensee, or his employee or agent, demanded, was shown and reasonably relied upon adequate written evidence for purposes of entering and remaining on the licensed premises is an affirmative defense in any prosecution therefor or to any proceedings for the suspension or revocation of any license based thereon. It shall not, however, be an affirmative defense if the defendant-license, or his agent or employee, accepted the written evidence knowing it to be false or fraudulent. Adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person is a document issued by a federal, state, county or municipal government, or its subdivision or agency including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act, or an identification card issued to a member of the armed forces.

No person shall transfer, alter or deface such an identification card; use the identification card of another; carry or use a false or forged identification card; or obtain an identification card by means of false information.

    Unless another penalty is set forth in this chapter, every person found guilty of a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of $500.00 for the first offense and $1,000.00 for each subsequent offense. A separate offense shall be deemed to have been committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. Any fines set forth in this chapter shall be assessed regardless of whether the violator is convicted or placed on supervision by the court. If the court is of the opinion that the ends of justice would be better served by requiring community service of the violator or a combination of a fine and community service, the fine may be mitigated at a rate of one hour of community service for every $10.00 of the mandatory fine. If the offense is related to alcohol or substance abuse and the offender is under 21 years of age, the local adjudicator (with the agreement of the offender) or court may, in lieu of any mandatory fines, assign the offender to a chemical abuse counseling program that is licensed by the Illinois Department of Alcohol and Substance Abuse which includes a certified evaluation program and not less than four hours of counseling.

Sec. 22-102. - Findings and declaration. 
    The board of trustees has found and declares: 
1.  Sales to be licensed and regulated pursuant to the provisions of this article have often been conducted and advertised in such a manner as to mislead and defraud the public and otherwise to result in harm to the public interest. 
2.  Such fraud and imposition on the public has included, by way of partial enumeration only: the misrepresentation of the condition or necessity which is the occasion of such sale; the misrepresentation of the identity of the person conducting such sale; the name and style in which such sale is to be conducted; and the excessive valuation and misrepresentation of the quality and ownership of goods to be sold at such a sale. 
3.  In order to prevent such fraud and imposition, the public interest requires the regulation of such sales and of their duration and conduct. 
4.  The public interest therefore requires that no such sale should be conducted without a license or otherwise than in accordance with this article.

The alarm administrator may waive this additional fine for a non-permitted system if the alarm user applies for a permit within ten days after such violation. 
C.  If cancellation occurs prior to law enforcement arriving at the scene, it is not a false alarm for the purpose of fees or false alarm count and no fees will be assessed. 
D.  Alarm dispatch requests, caused by an actual criminal offense or with evidence of a criminal attempt, or caused by weather conditions, or power failures lasting more than 1 hour, shall not be counted as a false alarm dispatch. 
E.  The alarm administrator may reinstate a suspended permit upon receipt of acceptable evidence that the cause has been addressed and appropriate corrective action has been taken as outlined in this article. Alarm events recorded on a year-to-date basis shall remain of record, and any subsequent false alarm chargeable event shall be assessed at the appropriate rate for the accumulated alarm events which have occurred in the current counting and billing period.

B.  A person commits an offense if he operates an alarm system during the period in which his alarm permit is suspended or revoked. The fee assessed for such an offense shall be the same as that defined for a "no permit" false alarm dispatch. 
C.  Unless there is separate indication that there is a crime in progress, the law enforcement authority may refuse police response to an alarm dispatch request at an alarm site for which no permit exists or the alarm permit is revoked or suspended. 
D.  If a suspended or revoked alarm permit is reinstated, the alarm administrator may revoke the alarm permit if it is determined that two subsequent false alarm dispatches occur during the remainder of the current counting or billing period. 
(Ord. No. 1411-02, § 2, 8-28-2002)

B.  The alarm user may submit new information to the alarm administrator relating to the repair, remedy of the problem or replacement of the system. The administrator shall review this new information and reject the information as inadequate to assure that the problem is solved, or, alternately, consider the problem or the causes of false alarms to be adequately addressed and subsequently issue, renew or reinstate the permit, or, if relevant, cancel the suspension notice. 
C.  The applicant or alarm user may appeal the decision of the alarm administrator to the alarm administrator by filing a written request for a review setting forth the reasons for the appeal within 20 days after receipt of the notice of denial or suspension from the alarm administrator. An alarm company may submit the request for review on behalf of an alarm user.

(Ord. No. 1593-07, § 3, 10-10-2007) 
Sec. 82-110. - Security. 
A.  Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The security fund shall serve as security for: 
1.  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
2.  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this article; and 
3.  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
B.  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. (See chapter 38, sections 38-18 and 38-82.) Any letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
1.  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee; 
2.  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and

C.  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the village engineer, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. (See chapter 38, sections 38-18 and 38-82.) Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village engineer may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection C. for any single phase. 
D.  Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
1.  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
2.  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
3.  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or 
4.  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
E.  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C. of this section. 
F.  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said interest to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection C. of this section. 
G.  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
H.  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed upon or otherwise violated.

2.  Material storage on right-of-way. No material shall be stored on the right-of-way, without prior written approval from the village engineer. All pipe, conduit, wire, poles, cross arms, or other materials shall be distributed along the right-of-way prior to and during installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the public or an obstacle to right-of-way maintenance or damage to the right-of-way and other property. If material is to be stored on the right-of-way, prior approval must be obtained from the village. 
3.  Hazardous materials. The plans submitted by the utility to the village shall identify any hazardous materials that may be involved in the construction of the new facilities or removal of any existing facilities. 
D.  Operational restrictions. 
1.  Construction operations on rights-of-way may, at the discretion of the village, be required to be discontinued when such operations would create hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and welfare. Such operations may also be required to be discontinued or restricted when conditions are such that construction would result in extensive damage to the right-of-way or other property. 
2.  These restrictions may be waived by the village engineer when emergency work is required to restore vital utility services. 
3.  Unless otherwise permitted by the village, the hours of construction are from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday to Saturday and 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Sunday. 
4.  Emergency work may be done at any time. Prior to commencing any emergency work in the right-of-way, a utility must notify the village department of public works and J.U.L.I.E. to enable J.U.L.I.E. to locate and mark facilities. 
E.  Location of existing facilities. Any utility proposing to construct facilities in the village shall contact J.U.L.I.E. and ascertain the presence and location of existing above-ground and underground facilities within the rights-of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities. The village will make its permit records available to a utility for the purpose of identifying possible facilities. When notified of an excavation or when so requested by the village or by J.U.L.I.E., a utility shall locate and physically mark its underground facilities within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, in accordance with the Illinois Underground Facilities Damage Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.)

Sec. 82-117. - Vegetation control; public trees. 
A.  Electric utilities-Compliance with state laws and regulations. An electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control activities in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable State of Illinois laws and regulations and, additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement with the village as permitted by law. 
1.  Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished. 
2.  Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without authorization as set forth herein. Unless otherwise specified herein, the formula developed by the International Society of Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition. 
3.  Removal of vegetation debris. The utility shall remove from the worksite all trimmed materials and other debris generated by pruning, trimming or vegetation control upon completion of the work and shall properly dispose of same. Restoration, clean-up and repair of the right-of-way for other than removal of vegetation debris shall be in accordance with section 82-119 of this article. 
B.  Other utilities-Tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is done by any other utility occupant of the public right-of-way and that is not performed pursuant to State of Illinois statutes and regulations specifically governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this article. 
1.  Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished. 
2.  Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages.

The village may require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning leave them in an unacceptable condition. 
3.  Removal of vegetation debris. The utility shall remove from the worksite all trimmed materials and other debris generated by pruning, trimming or vegetation control upon completion of the work and shall properly dispose of same. Restoration, clean-up and repair of the right-of-way for other than removal of vegetation debris shall be in accordance with section 82-119 of this article. 
C.  Public trees. 
1.  Definitions. 
    Diameter at breast height (DBH) means the measurement for trees other than nursery stock. It is the diameter of a tree measured at four and one-half feet above the existing ground line. 
    Mitigation means the required replacement of public trees in the public right-of-way or on public property in accordance with the evaluation of the village arborist and mitigation formulas set forth in this subsection 82-117 C. 
    Public tree means any tree located on the dedicated right-of-way of all public roads and streets (parkway trees) in the village. 
    Tree removal permit means the written permit issued by the village to authorize the removal of a public tree pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 82-117 C. 
    Tree removal permit application means the application required for issuance of a tree removal permit pursuant to this subsection 82-117 C. A tree removal application fee in the amount established in chapter 38 of the Village Code shall be submitted with the application. 
    Village arborist means a qualified arborist employed or engaged by the Village of Norridge who is designated to act as village arborist by the village president. 
2.  Applicability. The provisions of this subsection 82-117 C. shall apply generally and uniformly to all public trees as defined herein, except as provided below: 
a.  Tree emergencies to the extent provided in subsection 82-117 C. 
b.  Pruning of trees in compliance with the pruning standards set forth in subsection 82-117 A. is not subject to this subsection 82-117 C. 
3.  Prior destruction. If any public tree is damaged or destroyed prior to the submission of a tree removal permit application, or a permit application under this article, and it is reasonable to infer that the damage or destruction was effected so as to avoid the requirements of this subsection 82-117 C., the village may require mitigation for any such damaged or destroyed tree in addition to compliance with any other applicable requirements of this subsection 82-117 C. 
4.  Permit required for removal of public trees. Unless otherwise specifically authorized in this subsection 82-117 C., it shall be unlawful for any utility to damage or remove any public tree without a tree removal permit from the village. A utility that removes or damages one or more public trees without a tree removal permit shall be required to prepare, submit and obtain approval of a tree replacement plan and to mitigate the removal of or damage to such trees. 
5.  Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or public trees of special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means. 
6.  Action on applications for tree removal. 
a.  Unless otherwise specifically authorized herein, it shall be unlawful for any utility without a tree removal permit from the village to damage or remove any public tree. 
b.  A utility that damages or removes, or authorizes anyone to damage or remove, any public tree located in the right-of-way shall also be responsible for the damage or removal of such public tree, notwithstanding that the damage or removal was performed or caused by another person acting under the authority of such utility. 
c.  A utility that seeks to remove a public tree as described above in subsection B., must complete a tree removal permit application and shall be required to submit the application fee established in chapter 38 of the Village Code, and, if applicable, a mitigation fee required by chapter 38 of the Village Code, provided, however, that no tree removal application fee, permit fee or mitigation fee shall be required if an application is approved for removal of a public tree for the following reasons: 
(1)  The public tree must be removed because it is dead, dying or diseased. 
(2)  The public tree is weakened by disease, age, fire, storm or other natural causes such that it is likely to die or become diseased. 
(3)  The public tree constitutes a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
(4)  The public tree constitutes a hazard to a building. 
(5)  Removal of the public tree is consistent with good forestry practices. 
(6)  The public tree is causing or is likely to cause a public nuisance as a result of root invasion into public utility lines or private utility services located in the right-of-way. 
d.  Upon receipt of the utility's application, the village arborist shall evaluate the application. Subject to compliance with other applicable provisions of this Code, the village arborist may approve the application and issue a tree removal permit subject to such conditions as may be required for the preservation of other public trees in the affected area and for mitigation that may be required hereunder. 
e.  Prior to the removal of any public tree authorized for removal, the public tree shall be clearly marked by the village arborist. A utility shall not remove any unmarked public tree unless the removal is required by the existence of a bona fide emergency as set forth in this subsection 82-117 C. 
7.  Permit revocation and expiration. 
a.  A utility receiving a tree removal permit shall have a duty to remove the tree(s) identified in such permit within 90 days after the date of the tree removal permit. A utility receiving a tree removal permit shall be authorized to remove the tree(s) identified in such permit in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the tree removal permit application as approved by the village arborist. 
b.  Any permit issued by the village for construction in the right-of-way as provided in this article is subject to stop work order, suspension or revocation by the village engineer if the permit holder violates the terms of the permit or any other provision of this article. 
8.  Mitigation required for the removal of public trees. The removal of public trees requires mitigation as determined by the village arborist. Public trees shall be mitigated by either planting replacement trees in the right-of-way or by payment of a mitigation fee at the rate specified in chapter 38 of this Code considering the size, condition rating and species rating of the trees requiring mitigation. The village arborist shall determine the replacement rate for public trees requiring mitigation pursuant to the following formula: .75 inch diameter of new tree for each one inch of diameter of trees removed. 
a.  A utility receiving a permit for the removal of public trees shall have a duty to provide mitigation for their removal as specified in the tree removal permit issued by the village. 
B.  A utility that removes a public tree without a tree removal permit, or in violation of a tree removal permit, shall provide mitigation of such tree(s) in accordance with a tree replacement plan approved by the village arborist. 
c.  A utility that has damaged a public tree such that the tree is dying or diseased or is likely to die or become diseased shall replace such tree(s) in accordance with a tree replacement plan approved by the village arborist. 
9.  Tree replacement plans. 
a.  When required by this section 82-117, a tree replacement plan shall be submitted for the replacement of public trees removed or damaged by the utility providing for the planting of new trees of species and caliper and at locations approved by the village arborist and for a program of watering and maintenance to ensure that the new plantings will become established. 
b.  Any utility required to replace a public tree shall make all such replacements with a new tree or saplings of not less than two inches caliper or eight feet in height when deciduous ornamental trees in clump form or evergreens are used (an eight-foot tree is considered equivalent to a three-inch caliper tree). The total aggregate caliper of all such trees and/or saplings used as replacements based on good forestry practices as approved by the village arborist shall equal or exceed the DBH of the protected tree(s) so removed. 
c.  A cash tree replacement fee shall be submitted with the tree replacement plan as a guarantee that public trees will be replaced pursuant to the plan. The total fee shall be the replacement cost per inch at breast height as established in the village fee ordinance multiplied by the replacement rate specified in subsection 82-117 C.8. of this article. 
d.  Replacement of public trees shall be made, weather permitting, and with the advice of the village arborist, within six months of the date of issuance of the tree removal permit. The village arborist upon request may grant an extension of not more than 12 months time. Upon the planting of the mitigation trees and after the inspection and approval of the mitigation trees by the village arborist, the amount of cash tree replacement fee guarantee equal to the number of inches planted will be refunded to the applicant. 
10.  Tree emergencies. 
a.  If a tree emergency shall occur such that there arises a risk of imminent danger or hazard to persons or property from any public tree which ought to be cut or removed immediately or with as little delay as possible (e.g., public trees which threaten to fall or have fallen on houses or power lines or impede safe passage of streets or have become uprooted or unstable as a result of severe weather, floods or high winds), then it shall be lawful for the utility to remove such public tree to the extent necessary to avoid immediate danger or hazard without a tree removal permit provided that within 14 days after taking any such action the utility shall submit an after-the-fact tree removal permit application describing the tree emergency and the actions taken. 
b.  The utility shall notify the village arborist and receive verbal approval from the village arborist prior to removing any public tree. 
c.  If the village arborist upon his review of the tree removal permit application concurs that a tree emergency existed and that the utility's actions were warranted in response to the tree emergency, an after-the-fact tree removal permit shall be issued without a fee and no further action under these regulations shall be necessary. If the village arborist determines that no genuine tree emergency existed to justify the cutting or removal of the public tree(s), then such actions by the utility shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and the utility shall be required to provide mitigation as provided in subsection 82-117 C.8. 
11.  Fees. Fees for tree removal permit applications, tree removal permits, and tree plan reviews shall be paid as provided in chapter 38 of the Village Code. 
12.  Appeals. Except as otherwise provided in this article, an applicant may appeal in writing to the village engineer any decision made by the village arborist within 30 days of the decision being rendered. If not satisfied with the decision of the village engineer, the applicant may appeal in writing to the village board of trustees within 30 days of the decision rendered by the village engineer, but the board of trustees is not obliged to consider any such appeal. 
D.  Chemical use. 
1.  Except as provided in subparagraph 2. herein below, no utility shall spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any tree, shrub or vegetation in the village, for any purposes, for the control of growth, insects or disease. 
2.  Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the village engineer that such spraying is the only practicable method of vegetation control. 
(Ord. No. 1593-07, § 3, 10-10-2007) 
Sec. 82-118. - Removal, relocation, or modifications of utility facilities. 
A.  Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or for the operations of the village in or upon, the rights-of-way. 
B.  Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the public rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
1.  Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law; 
2.  If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if required; 
3.  If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this article; or 
4.  If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise. 
C.  Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. 
D.  Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the public rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the village engineer determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person. 
(Ord. No. 1593-07, § 3, 10-10-2007) 
Sec. 82-119. - Cleanup and restoration. 
    Upon completion of all construction or maintenance of facilities, the utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain in a timely manner and other property within ten days after any portion of the public rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the village. This includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the village engineer. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may be extended by the village engineer for good cause shown. 
(Ord. No. 1593-07, § 3, 10-10-2007) 
Sec. 82-120. - Maintenance and emergency maintenance. 
A.  General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the village and at the utility's expense. 
B.  Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit: 
1.  If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
2.  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the village engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately. 
3.  In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public. 
C.  Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after an emergency repair. 
(Ord. No. 1593-07, § 3, 10-10-2007) 
Sec. 82-121. - Variances. 
A.  Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the provisions of this article must do so in writing to the village engineer as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this article from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted. 
B.  Authority to grant variances. The village engineer shall decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the variance. 
C.  Conditions for granting of variance. The village engineer may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that: 
1.  One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
2.  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
D.  Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the village engineer may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the purposes of this article. 
E.  Right to appeal. Any individual or entity aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village engineer under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal the same to the village board or such other board or commission as the village board designates. Such application shall be submitted in writing to the village clerk within 30 days after such order, requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the village board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least ten days after the filing of the appeal. The village board shall timely decide the appeal. 
(Ord. No. 1593-07, § 3, 10-10-2007) 
Sec. 82-122. - Penalties. 
A.  Generally. Any individual or entity who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including third-party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit-related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility which does not pay the costs apportioned to it. 
B.  Tree protection. Whoever violates any of the provisions of section 82-117 of this article shall be punished by a fine of not less than $100.00 and not more than $1,500.00 for each such violation. A separate and distinct violation shall be deemed to have occurred for each public tree unlawfully damaged, removed and/or not replaced in violation of section 82-117 of this article, and a separate and distinct violation shall be deemed to have occurred for each day that such violation exists or continues. Any penalties imposed are in addition to any required mitigation. A further penalty is that whoever violates any provision of section 82-117 by not first obtaining permission for the removal of trees may be required to plant an additional 1.25-inch diameter of replacement tree for each one-inch diameter of tree wrongfully removed. 
(Ord. No. 1593-07, § 3, 10-10-2007) 
Sec. 82-123. - Enforcement. 
    Nothing in this article shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this article.

b.  The tax imposed by the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act; 
c.  The tax imposed by Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code; 
d.  911 surcharges; or

3.  Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data or information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or information intended to change its form or content.

6.  Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service; 
7.  Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made); 
8.  Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunication devices; or 
9.  Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act.

    Person means any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed by order of any court, the federal and state governments, including state universities created by statute, or any city, town, county, or other political subdivision of this state. 
    Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion. 
    Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state , or any like term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.

    Service address means the location of telecommunications equipment from which telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent. 
    Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by this article. 
    Telecommunications , in addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide-area telephone service, private-line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter, computer-exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service, specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means, between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic-sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value-added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier-access charges, right-of-access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.

Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
B.  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

(Ord. No. 1412-02, § 2, 8-28-2002) 
Sec. 90-6. - Same-Resellers. 
A.  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
B.  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
C.  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

The notice shall state the penalties that may be imposed if a hearing is not requested, including that a vehicle not released by cash bond and remaining in the village pound may be sold or disposed of by the village in accordance with applicable law. 
(b)  The owner of record seeking a hearing must file a written request for an administrative hearing with a police department designee and no later than ten business days from the receipt of certified notice to the owner of record, as determined by the signed acceptance of such certified notice. The date of the hearing must not be more than 30 days after a request for a hearing has been filed or at another agreed-upon date. Hearings are to be conducted in accordance with chapter 2, article IV of this Revised Municipal Code of the Village of Norridge. To the extent that there is a conflict between the provisions of chapter 2 and this chapter, this chapter shall prevail. 
(c)  If, after the hearing, the administrative hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in the violation of any applicable provision of this chapter, the administrative hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record civilly liable to the village for the amount of the administrative fee in the amount set in chapter 38 hereof. If, after a hearing, the administrative hearing officer determines by the preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was not used in the violation of this Code, the administrative hearing officer shall enter an order finding for the owner of record and for the return of the vehicle or cash bond. 
(d)  If a request for a hearing is not made within ten business days of the notice being mailed to the owner of record, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles. The vehicle shall not be released to the owner of record until the fee in the amount set in chapter 38 hereof is paid to the village and the applicable towing and storage fees have been paid to the towing agent. 
(e)  If the owner of record requests a hearing, but fails to appear at the hearing or fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and the administrative hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the storage fees. However, if the owner of record pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner of record, no default order need be entered if the owner of record is informed of his or her right to a hearing and signs a written waiver. Once the waiver is signed and the penalty and any applicable towing and storage fees are paid, the seized vehicle will be released. 
(f)  If a bond in the amount of the fee set in chapter 38 hereof is posted with the police department, the impounded vehicle shall be released to the owner of record. If a penalty is imposed under this section, the amount of the penalty shall be forfeited to the village out of the amount posted; however, in the event a violation is not proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the amount posted will be returned to the person posting the amount. All bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the village until the administrative hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until the circuit court issues its decision. 
(g)  An administrative fee, plus towing and storage fees, imposed pursuant to this section shall constitute a debt due to the village, which may be enforced in any manner provided by law. Any cash bond posted pursuant to this section shall be applied to the penalty. Except as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until (1) the administrative penalty, plus any applicable towing and storage fees is paid to the village, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle, or (2) the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law. 
(h)  Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 30 days after the expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial review of the village's action under this section, or, if judicial review is sought, the time at which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the village, or the time a final administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in default, may be disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law; provided that, however, where proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the vehicle may not be disposed of by the village except as consistent with those proceedings. 
(i)  Fees for towing and storage of vehicles under this chapter shall be the same as those charged for other police department tows.

B.  Basic user charge. The basic user charge is levied on all users to recover the operation, maintenance plus replacement (O, M & R) costs and shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters or sewage meters. The basic user charge shall be computed as follows: 
1.  Estimate the annual sanitary sewer volume. 
2.  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the sewer system, including a replacement fund for the year, for all works categories (O, M & R). 
3.  Proportion the estimated O, M & R costs to each user class by volume. 
4.  Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal domestic-strength sewage. 
C.  Debt service charge. The debt service charge is computed by apportioning the annual debt service as a charge per 1,000 gallons. 
D.  Capital improvement charge. The capital improvement charge is levied on users to provide for capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the sewage treatment works. The capital improvement charge is computed by apportioning the annual amount to be accrued as a charge per 1,000 gallons. 
E.  Annual review of adequacy of charges. The adequacy of the sanitary sewer service charge shall be reviewed, not less often than annually, by certified public accountants for the village in the annual audit report. The sanitary sewer service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs or O, M & R costs. 
F.  Rate change notification. The users of the sanitary sewer services will be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable to the sanitary sewer operation, maintenance and replacement. 
G.  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges shall be the metered consumption read to the lowest even increment of tens of gallons. 
1.  If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. 
2.  Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago or the village as applicable, if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from metered water consumption records. 
3.  Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled, without the consent of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. 
H.  Basic user charge established. There shall be and there is hereby established a basic user charge for metered water consumption as set forth in section 38-98 to be applied to all users to recover O, M & R costs.

This minimum charge consists of an amount for O M & R costs, debt service costs and capital improvement costs as set forth in section 38-98. Users outside the corporate limits of the village shall be charged at a flat rate per month as set forth in section 38-98. This rate consists of an amount for O, M & R costs, debt service costs and an amount for capital improvement costs as set forth in section 38-98. 
L.  Computation of sanitary sewer service charge. The sanitary sewer service charge for nonresidential users shall be computed by the following formula: 
CW + (CC + CD + CU) × Vu 
Where CW = Amount of sanitary sewer service charge ($) per billing period. 
CC = Capital improvement charge. 
CD = Debt service charge. 
Vu = Wastewater volume for the billing period. 
CU = Basic user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement. 
M.  Bills. 
1.  The rates or charges for services shall be payable monthly. The owner of the premises, occupant thereof and the user of the service shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the service to such premises by the village and such service is furnished to the premises by the village only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant and user of the services are jointly and severally liable therefor to the village. 
2.  Bills for sewer service shall be sent out by the village finance department on the first day of the month succeeding the period for which the service is billed. 
3.  All sewer bills are due and payable 15 days after being sent out. A penalty of ten percent shall be added to all bills not paid by the 15th day after they have been received. 
N.  Delinquent bills. If the charges for such services are not paid within 60 days after rendition of the bill for such services, such services shall be discontinued without further notice and shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled. 
O.  Lien; notice of delinquency. 
1.  Whenever a bill for sewer service remains unpaid for 60 days after it has been rendered, the village clerk is hereby authorized and directed to file with the county recorder of deeds a statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to the period covered by the bill. If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the village finance department has notice of this, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the premises, if his address is known to the finance department, whenever such bill remains unpaid for the period 45 days after it has been rendered. 
2.  The failure of the village clerk to record such lien or mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned in the foregoing section. 
P.  Foreclosure of lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity in the name of the village. The village prosecutor is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill has remained unpaid 45 days after it has been rendered. 
Q.  Revenues. All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the sewerage system shall be deposited in the sewerage account of the sewerage fund.

2.  In addition to the customary operating statements, the annual audit report shall also reflect the revenues and operating expenses of the wastewater facilities, including a replacement cost, to indicate that sewer service charges under the waste cost recovery system do in fact meet these regulations. In this regard, the financial information to be shown in the audit report shall include the following:

The notice shall set forth with specificity the exact nature of the noncompliance. The grantee shall have 90 days from the receipt of such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the village has not received a response from the grantee or upon receipt of the response does not agree with the grantee's proposed remedy or in the event that the grantee has not taken action to cure the default, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public hearing. The village shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least ten days prior to such public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to request termination of the franchise.

(j)  Audit. The village may order an audit of the grantee's records, or portions thereof, which shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in state law (65 ILCS 5/11-42-11.05, as amended from time to time, entitled Municipal Franchise Fee Review; Requests For Information).

B.  Application process. The village shall process applications as follows: 
1.  The first completed application shall have priority over applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same utility pole or wireless support structure. 
2.  An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the village fails to approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a completed application. 
However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75 days after the submission of a completed application. 
The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the ninetieth day after submission of the complete application or the tenth day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village's denial of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this article. 
3.  An application to collocate a small wireless facility that includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the village fails to approve or deny the application within 120 days after the submission of a completed application.

E.  Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. 
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application. 
F.  Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this article.

For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant shall enter into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement. 
(Ord. No. 1930-18, § 2(Exh. A), 7-25-2018) 
Sec. 98-275. - Collocation requirements and conditions. 
A.  Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
B.  Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
C.  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
1.  A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
2.  Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
3.  If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
4.  The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space," "communication worker safety zone," and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
D.  Reserved. 
E.  Compliance with codes. The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
F.  Compliance with design standards. The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a village ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. 
G.  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
    If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
H.  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
1.  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
2.  Forty-five feet above ground level. 
I.  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in section 98-284 of this article. 
J.  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
K.  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
L.  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
M.  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability. 
(Ord. No. 1930-18, § 2(Exh. A), 7-25-2018) 
Sec. 98-283. - Insurance. 
    The utility, facility or wireless provider and any sub-contractor of the utility, facility or wireless provider shall carry, at the utility, facility or wireless provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance: 
A.  Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility, facility or wireless provider occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility, facility or wireless provider as named insured and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) below: 
(1)  Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than:

"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to cancel or not to renew." 
Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility, facility or wireless provider shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. 
E.  Self-insurance. A facility, wireless provider or utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this section. A utility, facility or wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under subsection (a), or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility, facility or wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act. In the event that a facility, wireless provider or utility chooses to self-insure a subcontractor of any of these entities shall be required to comply with all the provisions of this section 98-283. 
F.  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on a facility, wireless provider or utility. The legal liability of the utility, facility or wireless provider to the village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. 
G.  Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the utility, facility or wireless provider in the State of Illinois.

B.  Authority to grant variances. The village engineer shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the variance request on an individual basis. 
C.  Conditions for granting of variance. The village engineer may authorize a variance only if the utility, facility or wireless provider requesting the variance has demonstrated that: 
1.  One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) facility or wireless provider create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
2.  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
3.  In the case of small wireless facilities or personal wireless services facilities, the strict application of the requirement will: 
a.  Unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services;

Section 9 - Performance Standards
Any use established in the "M" District after the effective date of the ordinance
from which this Section 8 is derived shall comply with the performance standards
set forth in this Section 8.
9.1  Purpose and Intent
The land in the Village and surrounding areas is predominantly devoted to
residential use. People who reside in such areas have chosen the location because
of the suburban atmosphere, free from objectionable noises, smoke, odors,
vibrations and other irritants that are frequently found in more urban locations.
The performance standards contained in this Section are designed to minimize
operations which would disrupt the existing suburban atmosphere.
It is further the intent of this Section to state the conditions of construction
and operation with which uses will be expected to comply. In many cases, the
relation of a prospective use to all performance standards cannot be judged
properly at the time of building permit issuance. In such cases, the recipient of
the building permit should note that these standards, like all other provisions of
this Chapter and Article, are continuing obligations and that all uses shall be
expected to operate in compliance with these standards. The building plans shall
58
Revised 12-14-2016 Ord. 1877-16
bear the signature of a qualified professional stating that all performance
standards will be complied with based upon the submitted building plans. The
Village retains the right to conduct its own investigation to determine compliance
with the performance standards at any time.
9.2  Applicability
All uses established after the effective date of the ordinance from which this
Section is derived shall comply with the performance standards of this Section.
Any existing use which complies with the performance standards of this Section on
the effective date of the ordinance from which this Section is derived shall
continue to so comply. If the operations of any lawful existing use do not comply
with the performance standards of this Section, such operations shall not be
varied or changed in such a way as to increase the degree of such violation. The
fact that the operation of a lawful existing use violated the performance
standards of this Section shall not of itself make such use subject to the
requirements of relating to nonconformities unless such use changed after the
effective dates of the ordinance from which this Section is derived.
9.3  Compliance
The performance standards set forth in this Section shall be complied with and any
use which fails to comply with these standards shall be in violation of this
Section and Article and shall be subject to penalties provided for such violation.
9.4  Noise
The decibels generated from a light manufacturing district use shall not exceed
70dBA as measured at the property line of the parcel from which the noise is
generated.
(a) Measurements
The sound levels shall be measured with a sound-level meter and octave-bank
analyzer to meet criteria for the noise measurement provisions of OSHA, and shall
conform to ANSI (American National Standards Institute) specifications.
(b) Exemptions
Noises of safety signals, warning devices, snow plowing and mosquito abatement.
9.5  Vibrations
Vibrations shall not be discernible at any property line to the human sense of
feeling.
9.6  Odors
The emission of odors or odor-causing substances beyond the property lines is
prohibited. The release of odorous matter across a property line shall not become
a nuisance or source of discomfort to the neighboring uses.
9.7  Glare Limitations
In any light manufacturing district, any operation or activity producing glare
shall be so conducted that direct and indirect illumination from the sources of
light shall not cause illumination in excess of one-half (0.5) of one foot-candle
when measured at any residence or business district boundary line. Flickering or
59
Revised 12-14-2016 Ord. 1877-16
intense sources of light shall be so controlled as not to cause a nuisance across
any lot lines.
9.8  Smoke and Particulate Matter
(a) General Limitations: In addition to the performance standards specified
hereinafter, the emission of smoke or particulate matter in such manner or
quantity as to be detrimental to or an endangerment of the public health, safety,
comfort, or welfare is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and shall
henceforth be unlawful.
1. Particulate matter emissions, in excess of the threshold limit values
caused by the wind from open storage areas, yards, roads, etc., within
lot lines shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping,

ARTICLE XIA
Planned Unit Developments
Section 1  Standards and Regulations
A Planned Unit Development shall be granted as a special use. Even though so
classified, it is of substantially different nature from other special uses. To
reflect this difference, additional regulations, procedures, standards and
criteria are hereby established. It is the intention of the Village that approval
of a Planned Unit Development will be granted only where departure from otherwise
applicable requirements of the Zoning Ordinance would be consistent with and
justified by the benefits accruing to the Village and the public interest,
generally, as a result of the Planned Unit Development.
Section 2  Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the regulations, standards, and criteria contained in this Article
is to provide an alternate zoning procedure under which land can be developed or
redeveloped with innovation, imagination, and creative architectural design when
sufficiently justified under the provisions of this Article. The objective of the
Planned Unit Development is to encourage a higher level of design and amenity than
is possible to achieve under otherwise applicable zoning regulations. The end
result can be a product which fulfills the objectives of the planning policies of
the Village while departing from the strict application of the use and bulk
regulations of the Zoning Ordinance and the design standards of the Subdivision
Ordinance. The Planned Unit Development is intended to permit and encourage such
flexibility and to accomplish the following purposes:
2.1  To stimulate creative approaches to the development of land in certain
business, commercial and manufacturing areas of the Village.
2.2  To facilitate an efficient arrangement of buildings, traffic and
circulation systems, land uses and utilities.
2.3  To preserve open space, existing landscape features and amenities and
to utilize such features in a harmonious fashion.
2.4  To provide for usable and suitably located public and common
facilities.
2.5  To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms and
building relationships, both within the Planned Unit Development and with the
surrounding neighborhood, and to unify building and structures through design.
2.6  To insure a high quality of design and construction of developments.
2.7  To develop new approaches to the environment through variety in type,
design and layout of structures, business, commercial and light manufacturing
buildings, transportation systems, and public facilities.
62
Revised 12-14-2016 Ord. 1877-16
Section 3  Location
A Planned Unit Development may be located as a special use in the M Restricted
Light Manufacturing District.
Section 4  Minimum Area; Ownership and Control
The site of the Planned Unit Development must be under single ownership and/or
unified control and be not less than four-tenths (0.40) acre in area.
Section 5  Permitted Uses
Any use permitted in the B5 Retail Business District or the M Restricted Light
Manufacturing District when situated on a lot of four-tenths (.40) acres or more,
or part of one development of four-tenths (0.40) acre or more in the M Restricted
Light Manufacturing District, shall only be permitted as a Planned Unit
Development.
Section 6  Design Standards and Criteria
The Planned Unit Development shall be designed to comply with the following
standards and criteria:
6.1  Ownership and Control
A proposed Planned Unit Development shall be under single ownership or unified
control at the time of filing an application for approval of the Planned Unit
Development, or the applicant shall provide written evidence of the applicant's
ability to gain unified control of the property if the Planned Unit Development is
approved.
6.2  Area, Lot Width, Yard, and Height/Bulk Requirements
All buildings, structures, and uses of land within the Planned Unit Development
shall conform to the area, lot width, yard, height and bulk regulations of the
zoning district in which the Planned Unit Development is located or, for those
uses which are not allowed in that zoning district but are allowed as part of the
Planned Unit Development, to the area, lot width, yard, height and bulk
regulations of the zoning district in which they are first permitted. These
regulations may be waived or modified by the Village Board of Trustees in cases
where it is determined that the changes will not negatively affect the value or
enjoyment of surrounding property, the provision of municipal services, or the
flow of traffic on local streets and the changes are justified by the standards
set forth in subsection 6.9 of this section.

Section 3 - Variations  Rules
3.1 - Purpose
Where in specific cases permits are applied for and there are practical
difficulties or particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter
of any provision or regulations of this Ordinance relating to the use,
construction, or alteration of buildings or structures, or the use of land, the

spaces, or the height of structures now existing or to be constructed, unless
after a public hearing as provided for in this article.
(b) The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be
used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in the district in which
it is located.
(c) The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances, and
(d) The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the
locality; provided that this subsection shall not govern consideration of
applications for variations of property located within the R1-A Single Family
Residence District.
102

The Board of Appeals should also take into consideration the extent to which the
following facts favorable to the applicant have been established, and shall find
that such variation:
(a) Will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property.
(b) Will not increase the hazard from fire and other dangers to said property.

Variations from the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance shall be granted by the
Board of Trustees only in accordance with the standards set forth in this section
and may be granted only in the following instances, but no such variation shall be
made in any case unless the same shall comply with the following limitations:
(a) Such variation, whether applicable to new buildings or to additions or
to alterations of extensions, of existing buildings, shall not reduce the
required dimensions of open spaces by more than twenty (20) per cent, nor reduce
the required total area of open spaces by more than ten percent (10%) nor reduce
the required total lot area by more than five percent (5%).
(b) Such variation shall not permit an increase in the height of structures more
than twenty per cent (20%) above the maximum height permitted by this Ordinance.

comprehensive amendment. Further, the Board of Trustees may require such evidence
and guarantees as it may deem necessary to assure compliance with such
stipulations, conditions or restrictions.
3.5  Conditional Period
A variation shall be conditionally valid for a period of no longer than three
hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date it is granted, except as provided for
herein. The condition shall be deemed fulfilled when the applicant obtains a
building permit which requires the variation. The Village Board of Trustees may
103
grant an extension of this period, valid for no more than one hundred eighty (180)
additional days, upon written application and good cause shown, without notice or
hearing. A written application for an extension shall be filed with the Village

to enable the Village Board of Trustees to consider the request for the extension
prior to the expiration of the variation period or such extension period
previously approved by the Village Board of Trustees. If the condition is not

may have been granted by the Village, then the grant of the variation lapses and
no variation shall be deemed to exist.
Section 4  Special Uses  Rules
4.1  Purpose
The development and execution of this article are based upon the division of the
Village into zoning districts within which districts the use of buildings,
structures and land, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are special types of uses which because of their specific characteristics in
relationship to uses permitted by right in a particular district, or the services
which they provide, cannot be properly permitted by right in a particular district
without consideration, in each case, of the impact of such uses upon neighboring
land, or of the public need for such uses at a particular location.
4.2 - Findings
No special use shall be recommended by the Board of Appeals pursuant to this
section unless the applicant shall establish that:
(a) The proposed special use will be in harmony with the general and specific
purposes for which this Zoning Ordinance was enacted and for which the regulations
of the district in question were established.
(b) The proposed special use will not have a substantial or undue adverse effect
upon adjacent property, the character of the area or the public health, safety and
general welfare.
(c) The proposed special use will not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of the adjacent property for uses permitted in the
district.
(d) The proposed special use will be served adequately be essential public
facilities and services such as streets, public utilities, drainage structures,
police and fire protection, refuse disposal, parks, libraries, and schools, or the
applicant will provide adequately for such services.
(e) The proposed special use complies with all additional standards imposed on it
by the particular provision of this Zoning Ordinance authorizing such use.
4.3 - Authority
Special uses shall be authorized or denied by the Board of Trustees in accordance
with the regulations and conditions set forth in this comprehensive amendment for
special uses.
4.4  Conditions on Special Use
104
The Board of Appeals may recommend and the Board of Trustees, in all cases, may
apply such stipulations, conditions or restrictions as it deems necessary to
assure the protection of the public health, safety, comfort, morals or general
welfare, and compliance with the standards as set forth in this article and, if
any, in the district regulations. Further, the Board of Trustees may require such
evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary to assure compliance with such
stipulations, conditions or restrictions. In addition, the Board of Trustees may
provide that all such stipulations, conditions and restrictions may be modified or
revised from time to time by the Board of Trustees following public notice and
hearing, the procedure being that as specified in this article for general special
use application. Violation of any such stipulation, condition and restriction,
when made a part of the terms under which the special use is granted, shall be
deemed a violation of the provisions and regulations of this Zoning Ordinance.
4.5  Limitations on Special Use Permits
(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in a special use permit, no special
use shall be enlarged or extended by structural alteration of a building or other
structure, unless the procedure specified in this article for a special use
application shall have first been complied with and a special use permit granted.
(b) A special use permit shall become null and void if the construction or
occupancy for which the permit was granted has not been actively pursued within
one year and completed and occupied within eighteen (18) months following the date
of approval by the Board of Trustees, except that such time limits may be extended
by the Board of Trustees, at its discretion, following a written request to do so.
(c) A special use permit shall become null and void if the special use for which
the permit was granted ceases for more than six consecutive months.
Section 5  Amendments  Rules
5.1 - Purpose
The provisions, regulations and districts contained within this Zoning Ordinance
may be amended from time to time by ordinance, but no such amendment shall be made
without a hearing before the Board of Appeals (or such other commission or
committee designated by the Board of Trustees), which shall report its findings
and recommendations to the Board of Trustee.
5.2  Standard and Findings
No amendment shall be recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the
following factors are considered:
(a)Existing uses of property within the general area of the property in
question and their relationship to one another.
(b)The zoning classification of property within the general area of the property
in question and their relationship to one another.
(c)The suitability of the property in question for the uses permitted under the
existing zoning classification.
(d)The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the property in
question, including changes, if any, which may have taken place since the day the
property in question was placed in its present zoning classification and that the
trend is consistent with the proposed amendment.
105
(e)Where applicable, the length of time the property in question has been vacant
or unutilized as currently zoned.

GUIDE FOR ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS" - MAY 1960 (REPRINTED JULY 1960)
Section 4 - Earth Station Antennae (Satellite Dishes)
4.1 - Definition; Purpose And Policy
A Satellite dish antenna ("Satellite Dish") is any disc antenna whether flat or
concave, or parabolic, which is designed to receive signals from satellites or
other sources, or to transmit such signals to a receiving station for noncommercial
purposes. Satellite Dishes are regulated by the Village for the purpose
of protecting the health and safety of the people and property in the Village and
for preserving the aesthetic quality of those neighborhoods where Satellite Dishes
are installed.
The purpose of this Section is to provide for the preservation of the aesthetic
quality of the neighborhoods within the Village by controlling installations so
that they blend in with the appearance of the subject property and surrounding
properties to the extent practical, and are installed and secured in a safe
manner.
114
Satellite Dishes shall be installed in compliance with the public safety
requirements of the most current versions of the BOCA Building Code; the Chicago
Electrical Code and the BOCA Property Maintenance Code ("Codes") as adopted by the
Village. Compliance with the Codes is required to ensure that each Satellite Dish
is securely fastened and will operate in a manner that will not cause an
electrical or fire hazard.
This section shall not be interpreted in such a manner as to prevent or impose
unreasonable limitations on the reception of satellite-delivered signals by those
Satellite Dishes which are specified in section (b), or to impose costs or other
burdens on the viewers of those same Satellite Dishes which are excessive in light
of the purchase and installation cost of the equipment.
4.2 - Permitted Use
A Satellite Dish shall be treated as a permitted use provided that:
(a) It is a receive-only Satellite Dish with a diameter no greater than one (1)
meter (approx. 3.3 feet); or
(b) It is a receive-only Satellite Dish with a diameter no greater than two (2)
meters (approx. 6.6 feet), and is located in either the B-1, B-2,
B-3, B-4, B-5, C, or M zoning district.
(c) It is not visible from the public street when installed on any zoning lot so
long as this placement does not prevent reception of an acceptable quality signal
or impose unreasonable expense or delay.
4.3 - Special Use Permit Required
All installations of Satellite Dishes which are not permitted uses as set forth in
Section (b) above, shall be considered as Special Uses, and may only be installed
upon obtaining a special use permit as provided by the Municipal Code of the
Village, and a building permit prior to commencing installation of said special
use.
4.4 - Permit Issuance Criteria; Residential Zone
No special use permit for building permit implementing such special use permit
shall be granted for a Satellite Dish in a residential zoned district (R-l, R-lA,

(a) Such Satellite Dish shall be of a size no greater than ten (10) feet in its
maximum dimension. Any such Satellite Dish shall be mounted as close to the ground
as possible, and shall not exceed ten (10) feet in height from the ground at its
maximum point. For safety reasons elevated installations on poles or roofs are
prohibited.
(b) The construction and installation of a Satellite Dish shall strictly conform
to all Village Ordinances and applicable codes. Once the Satellite Dish is
installed, it shall be properly maintained and the condition of the Satellite Dish
and any guy wires, mountings, mounting brackets or supports, shall not be allowed
to deteriorate or fall into disrepair.
(c) The Satellite Dish shall be shielded or screened from view by neighbors and
the general public at all times of the year. If a landscape screen is used it must
be maintained in a healthy growing condition and be opaque at all times of the
year.
115
(d) Not more than one (1) such Satellite Dish may be installed on a single zoning
lot.
(e) Satellite Dishes shall be located in the rear yard. The location shall not be
in the required setback area, unless encroachment in the required side or rear
setback areas provides an acceptable location if otherwise in conformity with all
of the other provisions of this Section. In such case, a variation is required,
and the applicant shall file a petition with the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(f) All installations shall exhibit architectural quality, be non-reflective, and
neutral in color to blend with surroundings, and shall exhibit structural
integrity. For safety reasons, materials used in the installation of a Satellite
Dish shall conform to applicable Codes. The entire installation, including
plantings, shall be compatible with the character of the surrounding area of the
Village and shall have no adverse impact on the property, the neighborhood, or
general public. Permanent foundations shall be adequate for anticipated wind loads
as required by applicable Code. Electrical connections shall be as required by
applicable Code provisions. Each Satellite Dish shall be adequately grounded for
protection against a direct strike of lightning with an adequate ground wire as
required by Code. Consideration shall be given to protection of children, as in
the case of an attractive nuisance.
4.5 - Special Use Permit Issuance; Nonresidential Zoning
No special use permit or building permit implementing such special use permit
shall be granted for Satellite Dishes in a nonresidential district (B-1, B-2, B-3,
B-5, C, and M), unless:
(a) Such Satellite Dish shall be of a size no greater than ten (10) feet in its
maximum dimension. Any such dish to be mounted on a rooftop shall be reviewed by a
licensed engineer or architect and certified as being safe and in compliance with
Village Ordinances and applicable Codes. No installation shall exceed the height
of any existing structure on the building or surrounding buildings, provided that
the overall height of the satellite dish does not exceed twenty-six (26) feet from
the ground to the top of the Dish. Elevated installations on poles are prohibited.
Any such dish shall be mounted as close to the ground or roof as possible and
shall not be more than ten (10) feet in height from the ground or no higher than
the established ridge line of the roof at its highest point.

to all Village Ordinances. Once the Satellite Dish is installed, it shall be
properly maintained and the condition of the Satellite Dish and any guy wires,
mountings, mounting brackets or supports, shall not be allowed to deteriorate or
fall into disrepair.
(c) The Satellite Dish shall be shielded or screened from view of neighbors and
the general public at all times of the year. If a landscape screen is used, it
must be maintained in a healthy growing condition and be opaque at all times of
the year. For purpose of rooftop installations, no part of the dish structure
shall be visible from the ground.
(d) Not more than one such Satellite Dish may be installed on a single zoning lot.
(e) Where nonresidential property abuts residential property, a Satellite dish
installation must comply with the location requirements of subsection (d)5 of this
Ordinance on the abutting side.
(f) All installations shall exhibit architectural quality, coloration to blend
with surroundings, and structural integrity. The entire installation shall be
116
compatible with the character of the surrounding area of the Village. Permanent
foundations shall be adequate for anticipated wind loads in accordance with Code
requirements. Electrical connections shall be as required by applicable Codes.
Each Satellite Dish shall be adequately grounded for protection against a direct
strike of lightning with an adequate ground wire as required by Code.
Consideration shall be given to the protection of children, as in the case of an
attractive nuisance.
4.6 - Procedure
An application for a special use permit for installation of a Satellite Dish shall
be obtained from the office of the Building Commissioner.
The application shall be submitted first to the Plan Commission for review, and a
written recommendation shall be made to the President and Board of Trustees for
final decision. Where a variation, pursuant to subsection (d)5 of this Ordinance
is requested or required, the application shall be submitted to the Plan
Commission for its review and written recommendation, followed by the Zoning Board

generally required for the actions sought (i.e., applicable fees, special use
permit, building permit, zoning variation, etc.), plus the following:
(a) Plot plan showing proposed location and dish projection at extremes of the
satellite band to be viewed. This requirement will be satisfied by drawing radial
lines from a point representing the pivot point of the dish to each end of the
satellite band, then drawing a line perpendicular to each radial at a distance
scaled to the distance between the rim of the dish to the pivot point. Each
perpendicular line shall be scaled to the diameter of the dish to show its maximum
protection on the plan at the extremes of its satellite scan. Compass direction
will be adequate for this requirement.
(b) Plans and specifications for the installation, including elevations, dish
configurations, mounting, and foundation.
(c) Complete description of any vegetation on the property.

period longer than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date it is granted
unless a building permit is obtained within such period or the uses commenced
within such period. The Village Board may grant one extension of this period,
valid for no more than one hundred eighty (180) additional days, upon written
application and good cause shown, without notice or hearing. If any special use is
abandoned, or is discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months, the
special use permit for such use shall become void and such use shall not
thereafter be re-established unless a new special use permit is obtained. This
subsection shall apply to all special use permits and variations heretofore
granted but with respect to which no building permit or certificate of occupancy
has been obtained; provided, however, that for purposes of the enforcement hereof,
the date of issuance of such special use permits and variations shall be deemed to
be the date of adoption of this Section by the Board of Trustees.
